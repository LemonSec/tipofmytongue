37
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,520
bug bounties

38
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,439
uh throughout the talks throughout the

39
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,960
slides that i'm gonna present i wanna

40
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,840
pretty much tell a story about a

41
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,600
ton of people amazing people in the

42
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,240
hacking community with a specific focus

43
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,320
on bug bounties where most of my work

44
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,439
has been done

45
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,720
and i want to tell the story of things

46
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,479
that they have accomplished

47
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,240
and if any of us would have been here if

48
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,759
it wasn't for the internet giving us

49
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,920
internet points and money for doing what

50
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,719
we do

51
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,960
um before i get started i want to make

52
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,719
sure that um

53
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,000
i clear up that

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,520
i'm not saying bug bounties were the

55
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,680
reason why these people were successful

56
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,000
they all put in a ton of effort lots of

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,120
you know

58
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,720

so i wanna make sure i clear that up a

62
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,959
lot of these people have done amazing

63
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,040
work on their own bug bounties was just

64
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,120
an avenue for a lot of them including

65
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,160
myself

66
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,760

00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,760
hacking

83

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,090
bit towards the end of the presentation

88
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,229
[Music]

89
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,159
all right but before i talk about any of

90
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,159
that stuff i kind of want to talk about

91
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,000
how i learned about bug bounties before

92
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,920
i even knew about hacking i knew about

93
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,280
hacking when i was a kid but i didn't

94
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,800
realize how big of a community was out

95
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,200
there for hacking and bug bounties

96
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,879
i literally had no clue what i wanted to

97
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,760
do in life i went to school

98
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,480
i was doing computer science at

99
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,319
sacramento state university if you're

100
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,480
familiar with this school i'm sorry if

101
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,920
you're not good for you it's not a good

102
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,599
school really for computer science at

103
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,120
least

104
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,120
for criminal justice great but don't go

105
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,720
there for computer science

106
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,640
uh but yeah i was you know walking down

107
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,159
the halls i didn't want to graduate

108
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,680
really i had no plans for the future i

109
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,680
didn't know what i wanted to do

110
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,879
what was i going to do with this shiny

111
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,159
piece of paper that cost me you know

112
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,439
eight six five thousand dollars a

113
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,959
semester

114
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,720
that i didn't really learn anything that

115
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,040
i was passionate about

116
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,640
and to be honest

117
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,879
formal education wasn't something that i

118
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,200
really cared for uh

119
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,720
i didn't see the point of going in and

120
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,319
turning in papers

121
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,959
i i there's a class that's required by

122
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,120
sac state that uh

123
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,599
it's game intro mobile game dev intro

124
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,440
whatever you want to call it with java

125
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,600
and i felt that class twice until i was

126
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,000
able to pass up the third time and then

127
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,520
because of that i was put on probation

128
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,120
so school was definitely something that

129
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,040
i wanted to do

130
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,919
what's funny is i was actually skipping

131
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,360
class to go to the library and learn how

132
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,360
to hack or i was going through class

133
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,280
opening up my laptop actually i'm taking

134
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,040
notes so i can hack more and uh learn

135
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,400
for you know whatever i was trying to

136
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,320
get into

137
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,759
and if it wasn't for youtube i would

138
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,040
have been able to pass a lot of my

139
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,000
courses uh big one is calc one

140
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,720
i

141
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,800
took calc one three times the first two

142
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,639
times i failed because the

143
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,280
teacher would have random quizzes and

144
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,560
when you're not going to class those

145
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,800
quizzes add up when you miss like 90 of

146
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,000
them that's like

147
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,600
you know 20 of your grades so i found

148
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,199
the one teacher that was nice enough to

149
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,600
tell us every friday you have a quiz so

150
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,120
i would show up on fridays for 15

151
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,360
minutes and then two nights before i

152
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,800
would go on youtube and practice

153
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,000
whatever i knew was going to be on that

154
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,240
test i would copy people's notes learn

155
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,600
him and go on youtube and practice and

156
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,039
do my homework and show up to class and

157
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,800
i finally got a beat somehow thanks to

158
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,639
youtube and passed and i did that with

159
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,240
calc 2 and calac3 it was the same

160
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,240
teacher we had a gentleman's agreement i

161
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,840
show up on friday i show up to your test

162
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,160
you leave me alone i pass and he agreed

163
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,160
he was okay with it

164
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,039
um

165
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,960
eventually i got enrolled

166
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,840
uh i come school started doing this cute

167
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,759
program called cyber security they're

168
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,120

194
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,680
company like the ones that i mentioned

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,880
uh but yeah so

206
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,960
it wasn't just uh the youtubers i talked

207
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,160
about youtube and the reason why i

208
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,680
graduated but it wasn't just youtube i

209
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,199
also learned about bug bounties there

210
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,120
are people that are making money and i

211
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,280
was on my super duper senior year it was

212
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,880
like my second rap around the senior

213
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,080
year that i was doing and i heard about

214
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,440
bug bounties and i really wanted to get

215
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,960
out it was either

216
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,639
i say screw all this money that i've

217
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,280
spent on school you know it's 30 40 50

218
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,720
000 dollars you've spent on school and i

219
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,560
drop out and don't get a piece of paper

220
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,560
or i just suck it up and go to school

221
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,800
for another two three semesters really

222
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,199
focus on learning whatever it is c's do

223
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,039
get degrees get the degree have the

224
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,960
paper and put it on my desk and go get a

225
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,039
full-time job and i did that i

226
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,960
went and did exactly that i learned

227
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,039
about bug bounties but i realize a lot

228
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,160
of the companies that you want to

229
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,919
interview for they want to have a degree

230
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,680
or a million years of experience out of

231
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,080
college so they you know having the cs

232
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,840
degree is what kind of helped me

233
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,360
but the bug money thing was great

234
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,560
because

235
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,080
they were going to pay me if i find

236
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,360
something on my free time i don't have a

237
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,199
boss i don't have to report to anybody

238
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,879
and i thought that was like hey i can do

239
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,400
that i can i can probably hack into a

240
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,759
company or two and make some money and

241
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,520
learn while i'm at it it was a legit

242
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,879
business i saw a lot of people that were

243
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,960
making a lot of good money uh yahoo was

244
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,280
uh this is post i don't know if you guys

245
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,560
are familiar with yahoo's bug bounty

246
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,240
program they they were giving away like

247
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,800
20 gift cards at some point and then the

248
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,479
internet like went after them cancelled

249
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,759
their bug bounty program and then they

250
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,039
started paying like a lot of money at

251
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,199
this point uh so i really entered the

252
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,000
bug bounty phase at a very early age as

253
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,199
people were starting to pay more and

254
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,879
more

255
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,560
and honestly change everything uh

256
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,399
first of all i'm not here to sell you on

257
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,760
black bounties i'm not trying to tell

258
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,958
you to go do black bounty or your

259
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,399
company should do a bug bounty anything

260
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,360
like that

261
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,360
it's just it really changed my life it

262
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,360
really helped me do things that i didn't

263
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,800
think i would do

264
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,399
it pushed me to the one i wanted to get

265
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,440
out of school for someone who didn't

266
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,640
care about school it pushed me to want

267
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,920
to get things done and move forward with

268
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,120
my life

269
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,040
and it wasn't just my life that changed

270
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,920
um

271
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,760
it changed a lot of people's lives the

272
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,360
thing with bug brownies it's very global

273
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,279
anybody in the world could participate

274
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,120
so i only changed my life

275
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,120
it changed at a lot of people's lives

276
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,959
including myself and a ton of other

277
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,959
people that i have their photos on here

278
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,839
uh this is about a hundred people that i

279
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,920
could find on the leaderboard of hacker

280
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,360
one i'm gonna talk about some of these

281
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,279
in a little bit but

282
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,480

289
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,360
stats that i got from hacker one it's

290
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,800

291
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,160
countries that people are participating

292
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,920
in bug bombings the only way you can do

293
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,600
bug bounties if it's you're one of those

294
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,279
popular countries where they're

295
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,720
sanctioned by the u.s so north korea

296
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,279
one of the countries i'm from syria

297
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,519
and uh kapad a handful but everybody

298
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,120
else could participate get paid all you

299
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,240
have to do is give them your tax

300
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,680
information

301
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,839
and

302
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,080
throughout

303
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,800
the

304
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,240
scene that i've seen people come into

305
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,320
blog brownies we have different paths

306
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,200
and i'm going to talk about that a

307
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,720
little bit but

308
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,880
this is just a

309
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,640
small percent of people that are in the

310
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,240
black box this is not everybody this is

311
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,560
not every single platform it's just

312
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,040
a hundred or so people that i have found

313
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,320
that they were on a leaderboard at the

314
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,000
time of making this slide itself and

315
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,680
someone should mix the nft by the way i

316
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,600
think it'll be a good one

317
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,120
and also the cool thing about bug bounty

318
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,120
is nobody cares about your background

319
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,640
nobody cares if you have a bachelor's

320
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,640
degree no one cares if you

321
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,480
are just learning if you don't know

322
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,000
anything you know everything nobody

323
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,920
cares honestly no one cares

324
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,519
everyone could get involved it's open to

325
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,360
everybody

326
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,480
so let's talk about some of these

327
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,920
stories before we talk about them

328
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,519
there's a number of profiles that i want

329
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,200
to talk about and each profile will tell

330
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,480
a story about some of those people that

331
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,000
fit that profile

332
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
um it's really important to understand

333
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,839
why people do black bounty it's not all

334
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,440
about money you know i know that money

335
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,680
is a big driver for a lot of stuff

336
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,959
especially with bug bounty a lot of

337
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,560
people do it because it looks like this

338
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,920
coolest thing that you can make money

339
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,959
you can make hundreds of thousands of

340
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,959
dollars within a few hours within a few

341
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,959
a few days or a few months

342
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,720
but there is different reasons also

343
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,600
people hack with black brownies

344
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,880
and again i'm going to

345
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,560
say this one last time i'll promise i'll

346
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,000
move on from it it really doesn't matter

347
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,680
what your background is some of the

348
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,880
people that i'm going to talk about come

349
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,880
from a digital marketing

350
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,360
advertisement uh well our developers

351
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,800
people that were i.t folks that were

352
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,320
working on it team so it doesn't matter

353
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,240
what you have done the cool thing with

354
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,720
this is that you can learn and also earn

355
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,480
as you go

356
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,839
so let's talk about these uh for the

357
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,519
next few minutes i just want to if you

358
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,800
guys see people that you seem

359
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,000
interesting to you their handles are

360
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,040
going to be the first things that come

361
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,079
up uh look upon one look up on twitter a

362
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,760
lot of them are very active they still

363
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,440
share some other stories they share some

364
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,440
of their trips uh tricks about hacking

365
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,839
how they have gotten

366
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,279
started some really cool hacking tips

367
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,279
and things i've gone really good at

368
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,279
so the first one i want to talk about is

369
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,240
the full timer the full timer is the

370
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,160
main objective is obviously they want to

371
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,519
make money that's the person that i

372
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,519
talked about they want to pay for their

373
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,839
bills

374
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,200
and there's uh cases of people that have

375
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,040
made hundreds of thousands of dollars

376
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,880
and we also have people that have made

377
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,200
millions i think the last number i got

378
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,279
was one of the hackers his name is eric

379
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,639
today is new

380
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,839
uh dude has a scanner in vb6 and he has

381
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,279
made three million dollars with this

382
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,720
this thing that he has written from

383
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,040
technology from 20 years ago uh he's

384
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,560
very open about it he says it himself

385
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,160
like it's really old code that i've

386
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,600
built it's the only language that i'm

387
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,399
good at

388
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,000
but it's made him three million dollars

389
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,519
on hacker one alone i think they just

390
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,639
announced his

391
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,160
uh three million dollar celebration

392
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,120
thing

393
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,440
one of the first ones is dog eg uh he's

394
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,720
one of my favorite people that i've

395
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,880
talked to he's based out of the us

396
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,639
on twitter if you type in doggie g he

397
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,720
should come up or it's d dog eg maybe

398
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,000
but he should be the only one with that

399
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,800
name

400
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,040
he was actually a

401
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,320
black cat

402
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,880
he went to prison and served a 13-year

403
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,720
term for hacking multiple governments

404
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,760
and companies in the 90s and early 2000s

405
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,240
one of them was yahoo and he's also made

406
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,680
a million dollars from packing yacht

407
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,279
illegally now

408
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,360
prior to that he was a chef he had to go

409
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,720
do something outside of computers

410
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,839
because he was banned from using

411
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,760
computers and hacker one has this

412
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,519
program called haka one elite where they

413
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,920
pick five hackers every year i think he

414
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,680
was in the fourth year of the haka one

415
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,279
elite where

416
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:16,880
he was given this poster that just says

417
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,480
you've been a big part of community

418
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,440

419
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,639

420
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,079
critical vulnerabilities or you were

421
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,279
consistent what you were doing

422
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,079
like i said he was a black cat

423
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,320
he started hacking yahoo legally and

424
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,600
when i met him and we talked a little

425

426
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,079

427
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,040
paying my bills now if 13 years ago bug

428
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,959
bounty is what i think i wouldn't go to

429
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,320
prison i wouldn't have to you know serve

430
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,639
this you know long sentence because i

431
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,160
was just dumb and i was a young kid i

432
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,160
wanted to hike so it's very cool that

433
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,600
he's you know turned his life around and

434
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,519
now he's a

435
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,920
something opsec engineer or full or a

436
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,600
offensive security engineer at a company

437
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,920
called briggs

438
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,079
and to show some of his stats on the

439
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,079
right you guys is right you can see his

440
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,160
uh verizon media has changed name like a

441
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,000
million times in the past three years

442
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,600
there used to be yahoo that turned to

443
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,839
oath and then they became verizon media

444
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,399
and now they're called yahoo again

445
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,240
but he was the number one hacker on

446
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,880
their program and these are all the

447
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,480
private uh sorry public programs that

448
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,680
you can see on his profile so there's

449
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,440
private ones that i can't show

450
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,279
but the public programs that he's hacked

451
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,040
on the us department of defense is a big

452
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,680
one uh he is also going to prison and a

453
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,600
part of his uh sentence was hacking the

454
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,440
department of defense and now he's one

455
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,720
of the top hacking

456
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,480
top ranking hackers on the department of

457
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,839
defense both on haka one uh senec

458
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,079
where they do most of their engagements

459
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,920
the next one is mayonnaise i call it my

460
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,079
own eyes it's based on a song really old

461
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,920
song i don't know if you know that song

462
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,199
he said that's where he got his name

463
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,760
from he comes from a i.t and data

464
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,639
science

465
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,040
no security background at all he just

466
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,880
knows how to handle data and if you know

467
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,040
about today's age everything we do is

468
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,040
data everyone's data is online

469
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,240
and uh he used to build crms

470
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,079
for you know to make money uh for

471
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,920
college and pay for it

472
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,160
and then once he was uh looking for new

473
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,760
business ideas he discovered bug

474
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,320
bounties he's like oh i i can find data

475
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,760
i just have to find these paths and look

476
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,360
for these different routes and they

477
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,720
would spread out information i know how

478
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,160
to do that i've built stuff on top of

479
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,440
these apis

480
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,480
that's got to look for them and

481
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,240
manipulate them to make money

482
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,680
within two years he made a million

483
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,600
dollars on hakko one

484
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,240
and you can see within those two years

485
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,160
he was number two on the yahoo program

486
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,680
he's hacked paypal

487
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,240
department of defense shopify and right

488
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,839
now i don't i think he's retired

489
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,920
somewhere in the east coast hanging out

490
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:39,120
and keep in mind when i say yahoo the

491
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,959
yahoo program has been around for eight

492
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:41,839
years

493
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,000
so for someone to come in in 2019

494
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,079
actually more than eight years now uh

495
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,720
12 years almost 10 11 years almost and

496
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,880
for someone to come in at 2019

497
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,199
and become a second place hacker after

498
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,880
eight years of the program being around

499
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,560
it says a lot that you know if you put

500
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,160
in the time you put in the effort you

501
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,759
can also make it happen and making a

502
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,440
million in two years it's it's

503
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,800
incredible

504
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,399
uh sam also known as zlz uh he's a very

505
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,480
he's very into uh hacking crypto wallets

506
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,560
right now but before that he was i met

507
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,880
him when he was 16 i want to say 16 15

508
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,240
16. uh he was a freelance developer is

509
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,920
what he called himself at 16 and he used

510
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,680
to play video games and

511
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,199
he didn't know it was called hacking but

512
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,720
he found ways of kicking people out of

513
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,839
the game trolling people's uh accounts

514
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,360
and then he realized oh that is called

515
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,880
hacking i can hack games and make money

516
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,839
from it

517
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,600
he became a

518
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,920
triage analyst at hacker one for a few

519
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,199
years i think he was still

520
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,040
when they employed them

521
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,360
he had companies like apple tesla he

522
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,199
actually got a really cool bug from

523
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,440
tesla i think 15 000

524
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,199
because he bought a tesla and he put a

525
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:46,639
payload there while he bought it and it

526
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,040
fired and they paid him 15 000 and it

527
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,040
was all over the news uh he just started

528
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,519
palestine it's his own uh consultancy uh

529
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,440
he just started that last year year and

530
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,199
a half after we sat down i'm not a part

531
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,279
of palestine but a lot of us that were a

532
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,360
part of this research for apple they all

533
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,040
made it into a consultancy firm now and

534
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,160
they're doing pen tests for a lot of

535
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,599
companies so you may have seen some of

536
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,880
these headlines i think in 2020 october

537
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,559
november of 2020

538
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,280
when a group of us hacked apple

539
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,439
and we found like 50 60 bugs on apple's

540
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:16,959
program that number's a little bit

541
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,640
outdated it was about it was close to

542
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,160
500 000

543
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,799
that was made between six of us

544
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,880
so it goes to show again uh he was still

545
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,919
young he's still young i think he's

546
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,440
barely 21 or 22 now uh at 19 and making

547
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,919
a big chunk of that it's a lot of money

548
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,280
and he just dropped out of college i was

549
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,480
like nope i'm not going to make the same

550
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,160
mistake as you i'm going to go work full

551
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,919
time and make money and it worked for

552
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,520
him

553
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,600
it's also the academic type like if you

554
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,840
know not me i don't consider myself one

555
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,919
of those i made that very clear but

556
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,440
there are people that are doing this

557
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,480
just to

558
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,400
get better their objective is to learn

559
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,640
they're either in school or they want to

560
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,080
get certifications uh oscp or swe you

561
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,600
know pentester plus whatever you know

562
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,520
you want to get they also use bug

563
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,600
bounties to do that

564
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,520
so they're still again unsure what they

565
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,280
want to do they're very interested in

566
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,280
cyber security

567
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,360
and if you think about it if you are

568
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,280
i don't know 18 19

569
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,480
in college

570
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,720
not a lot of responsibilities you have a

571
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,240
lot of free time you play a lot of video

572
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,160
games more than likely

573
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,360
replace video games with bug bounties

574
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,720
and if you make a thousand dollars a

575
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,160
month two thousand dollars a month which

576
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,600
is very easily doable with bug bounty

577
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,520
that's a lot of money in college

578
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,880
you no longer have to survive on like

579
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,400
ramen and you know frozen food you can

580
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,520
literally pay for everything you want

581
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,039
and i know a lot of kids have done that

582
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,320
and to be honest a lot of these folks

583
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,039
end up graduating from whatever the goal

584
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:41,919
was you know they get their

585
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,160
certification they do it for one two

586
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,080
three four years whatever it is they

587
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,679
learn they become really good at hacking

588
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,360
and what we call is graduate from doing

589
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,880
bug bounties and they go get their first

590
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,799
job at a company uh they become a

591
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,240
consultant or they start their own

592
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,760
companies like sam was doing or a few

593
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,360
others i'm gonna talk

594
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,799
talk about so

595
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,120
uh jack cable anyone familiar with who

596
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,960
jack is

597
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,120
so he also was

598
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,120
very young when he we uh when i heard

599
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,600
about him he was uh i want to say 16

600
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,679
when the department of defense launched

601
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,440
their hack the air force program

602
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,120
and he was i think the number one number

603
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,360
two hacker on that program

604
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,880
and later on he got a job through

605
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,280
the department of defense he worked for

606
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,960
um

607
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,880
one of the defense digital services he

608
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,120
worked for them and then later on just a

609
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,559
couple of years ago he was helping with

610
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,400
the election security stuff

611
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,400
and his background was nothing with

612
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,640
security really he just

613
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,320
did development and knew how to code at

614
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,600
a young age who was a self-doubt

615
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,360
engineer and then he heard about bug

616
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,280
bound he's at 15 16 and he wanted to

617
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,120
learn how to hack hacked the air force

618
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,480
scored his job i don't even think he

619
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,400
touches black bounties anymore and

620
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,840
because of all his work he has done he

621
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,840
also was accepted to stanford so he went

622
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,440
to stanford i think he's already

623
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,280
graduated at this point

624
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,520
but yeah it's you know he's a prime

625
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,280
example of someone who came from a

626
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,760
really no security background again he's

627
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,840
i understand he's younger 16 15 you have

628
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,679
more time but he put in the time and

629
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,039
effort and while he was going to school

630
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,559
he learned and learned and learned and

631
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,480
he ended up being one of the advisors on

632
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,760
the all the election stuff that was

633
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,960
happening

634
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,080
a dc

635
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,159
he is another young hacker i'm not sure

636
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,640
how old he is i've met him a few times

637
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,320
it's hard to tell but he seems very

638
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,280
young

639
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,640
his background is a little bit different

640
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,320
he was doing a lot of ctfs he was

641
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,559
playing ctf's to learn a lot of teachers

642
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,320
like we do i'm here downstairs i think

643
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,320
secure code warriors doing one

644
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,320
every conference you go to they do a ctf

645
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,760
and it's a really good place to get

646
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,280
exposed to what you like to do in

647
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,520
securing cyber security especially the

648
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,880
bigger ones when they have web they have

649
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,039
crypto they have mobile you get to play

650
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,880
them and see okay maybe i like web over

651
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,960
mobile maybe i like mobile or something

652
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,919
else

653
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,440
he did this exact same thing and he

654
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,720
became really really good at playing

655
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,000
ctf's he heard uh about bug bounties

656
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,840
through a ctf that hacker one hosted and

657
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,080
he actually won that ctf and they flew

658
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,000
him out to one of the events

659
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,039
that i'll talk about those events a

660
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,440
little bit but uh he said i reached out

661
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,799
to him because i was familiar with the

662
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,240
story and i asked him like hey what's

663
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,159
the story behind

664
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,480
you and bug brownies like he always

665
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,320
talked about how much it's helped him so

666
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,799
he told me he didn't really rely on bug

667
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,200
bounties to get a job or to like use it

668
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,559
for his resume

669
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,080
but it helped him understand all these

670
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,360
technical things that they asked you

671
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,360
during interviews better because he was

672
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,720
actually on the offensive side now he

673
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,559
was finding his vulnerabilities and when

674
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,039
he was doing these uh interviews

675
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,400
he was able to answer those questions

676
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,159
better because he had a dev background

677
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,520
already he know how to write secure code

678
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,200
as much as he could but he didn't know

679
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,720
how to explain what an exercise was what

680
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,640
a sql injection was so he's finding them

681
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,480
learning them and then now he's going to

682
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,559
interview for different jobs and he's

683
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,559
actually a security engineer for get lab

684
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,840
the last time i spoke to him

685
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,600
there's also what i want to call the

686
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,360
careerist

687
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,440
this objective is fully and i've seen so

688
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,559
many of these people that come through

689
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:53,840
the bug bounty scene or even the pen

690
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,760
testing scene is that they just want to

691
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,919
get a job doing something technical with

692
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:00,559
pen testing with offensive security

693
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:01,679
they just want to learn they want to

694
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,760
they want to see where they fit in

695
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,520
so again the main objective is to score

696
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,320
a job they have all the necessary

697
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,320
experience they've read all these books

698
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,679
that have read these you know i've done

699
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:12,960
all these different challenges i've done

700
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,159
ctfs

701
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,000
and they want to get past the hr maybe

702
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,240
they don't have enough experience and uh

703
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,760
i personally could talk about this and i

704
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,000
will a little bit i got past hr because

705
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,159
of my background experience so you may

706
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:25,360
know how to use these tools but you have

707
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,039
nothing to showcase for it's great that

708
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,360
you know how to use burp street but can

709
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,880
you show that you can find things with

710
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,640
it

711
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,840
so we want to talk about this a little

712
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,640
bit

713
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,840
more i posted this tweet and i asked for

714
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,440
two things one was

715
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,120
uh is anybody doing full blog bounty

716
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,960
hunting which we already talked about a

717
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,640
little bit those were the first profile

718
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,559
that we talked about and the second one

719
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,600
is has anyone gotten a job by doing this

720
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,919
and putting uh the bug bounty experience

721
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,159
on their resume so jack cable not jacket

722
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:55,600
was sorry jack i don't know his last

723

and uh he reported to the write-up the

727

consultancy big consultancy place to

732
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,600
work for but he purely got that job

733
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,880
because he hacked on the facebook blog

734
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,880

737
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,360
mattered and could have hired had the

738
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,200
hiring power to get him on the uh the

739
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,159
team uh next one is shubs

740
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:29,520
we will talk about him a little bit more

741
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,600
in a little bit but he got his first job

742
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,080
i want to say bishop fox uh by putting

743
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,440
some of his bug bounty stuff on his

744
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,200
resume and he used some of that money to

745
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,919
travel the world

746
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,679
albarton he was a student in

747
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,840
i want to say australia sydney he got

748
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,919
his first gig from even though he was a

749
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:49,679
student at the time he scored a job

750
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,360
becoming apprentice on a student visa in

751
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,279
australia somewhere and he was able to

752
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,360
help his family tom he's a great

753
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,120
developer some of his tools that he's

754
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,960
put out for offensive security are great

755
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,279
he also has gotten three jobs in the

756
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,360
past like seven years he's gone from

757
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,360
company to company because he made so

758
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,799
many great tools for hackers and also

759
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,080
his experience with bug brownies as well

760
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,840
random robbie if you're a developer

761
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,120
you've probably seen him in your s3

762
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,200
buckets at some point he like wrote to

763
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,720
every s3 bucket at some point in his

764
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,600
life

765
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,200
everyone that was vulnerable and because

766
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,640
of that he landed another job and i

767
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,120
think he's also at bishop fox as well

768
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,559
this is a cool one this is not the

769
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,720
person that got the job but one of their

770
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,240
number one hackers

771
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,320
their number one hacker on their program

772
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,840
they reached out to him for an interview

773
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,279
they hired him and he was hired at

774
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,600
mail.ru because he was just killing it

775
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,200
on their bug bounty program and he

776
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,279
probably knew more about their platform

777
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,559
than the engineers knew because of how

778
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,480
much he stared at it uh so another

779
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,240
example of people

780
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,880
that have scored a job um by just doing

781
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,400
bug bounties

782
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,559
then alyssa also did the hack the

783
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,559
pentagon a lot uh she currently also was

784
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,559
the defensive security engineer same

785
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,640
thing if i just wanted to you know put

786
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,919
some of these up there's a bunch of them

787
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,080
vimeo number one hacker on their program

788
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,640
still is but is not hired by them uh

789
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,480
douglas stay same thing ranked hacker in

790
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,960
their program now he works for them uh

791
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,200
been healed same thing he's gotten cvs

792
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,400
from buck bunnies that put him on his

793
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,159
resume you guys get the point i don't

794
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:13,679
need more screenshots but yeah there's a

795
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,000
lot of people that have done this

796
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
it just shows that you can leverage your

797
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,120
experience if you find a few

798
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,039
vulnerabilities who wouldn't want to say

799
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,240
hey i've hacked the department of

800
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,080
defense you know i've gone to sheldon

801
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,440
department defense put on your resume i

802
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,880
think a lot of engineers or a lot of

803
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,880
hiring people will see that as a good

804
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,559
experience versus having actual work

805
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:31,679
experience that you haven't gone in the

806
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,640
past four or five years

807
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,000
uh some of the favorite stories that i

808
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,760
have it's the same thing some of the bug

809
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,760

host an event every few months in a

819
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,240
random city it would fly everybody out

820
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,440
to that city

821
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,039

one is the moonlighter

891
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,279

and they want to earn

893
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,640
they already have a full-time job they

894
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,240
don't need to have another job but they

saying thank you for

952
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,240
one of the craziest bugs i've ever seen

953
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,840
he had access to some really really

954
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,360
crazy internal stuff that belonged to

955
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,360
the department of defense

956
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,720
and they were even shocked they were

957
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,480
like this should have never happened and

958
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,480
he was the person that found it and

959
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,919
honestly he's one of the

960
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,679
best connections i've made not only

961
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:31,440

962
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,640
learned together we have done a lot of

963
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,960
crazy stuff together and

964
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,559
he's a prime example of someone who has

965
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,720
done it all he wanted to go up the ranks

966
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,720
at work he did it through bug bounties

967
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,480
he wanted to get better at his job he

968
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,840
did it with black bounties and he wanted

969
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,360
to make money and he i think he was

970
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,760
matching his salary uh by moonlighting

971
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,200
for uh hacker one and black background

972

976
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,240

00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,519

992
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,159
works at a company called uh trusec he

993
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:29,519
makes a lot of cyber security content

994
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,600
with like red teaming for them but a lot

995
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,200
of his exposure came from his black

996
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,960
bounty stuff he was putting out videos

997
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,960
of how i made fifteen thousand dollars

998
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,799
in in one day doing bug bounties it was

999
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:40,720
just one single bug that he had found

1000
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,240
and now he's you know he's got a lot of

1001
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,600
sponsorship opportunities from other

1002
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,600
companies like hack the box try hacking

1003

you name he works with him and makes

1004
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,159
content for them

1005
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:50,640
and he's also used those information use

1006
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,559
those bugs he has found to present in a

1007
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,640
number of different

1008
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,159
conferences

1009
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,640
next one is katie insider phd

1010
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,039
she does a lot of api hacking stuff uh

1011
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,360
she also was a mentee i would eventually

1012
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,039
hosted they bring out people that you

1013
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,279
know are very new to the uh to the scene

1014
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,679
they put him with a hacker top hacker in

1015
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,440
the scene they learn everything from

1016
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,200
them she came to a lot of the life

1017
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,600
hacking events but then ended up going

1018
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,480
down the path of making youtube videos

1019
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,320
and now she talks at a lot of

1020
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,559
uh different conferences she was she was

1021
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,320
hired from background by buck crowd and

1022
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,919
she just left the company not too long

1023
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,240
ago which black is also one of those bug

1024
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,240
bounty platforms so it just shows went

1025
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,320
to an event learned some hacking made

1026
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,240
some videos put herself out there and

1027
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,240
within a year or two she was hired she's

1028
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,519
very big in school i think she has her

1029
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,039
phd in computer science or something

1030
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,320
similar

1031
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,559
and now she's left and she's doing work

1032
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:43,760
on her own and i think she's teaching

1033
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,720
now the university out in the uk

1034
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,360
the last one is farah i'm not sure if

1035
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,200
you may have seen her on instagram a lot

1036
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,279
uh she's a content creator out of india

1037
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,519
she started making content back in

1038
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:58,399
2020 uh she started helping people on

1039
00:32:58,399 --> 00:32:59,840
her instagram she talks about different

1040
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,519
resources on how you can get into cyber

1041
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,399
security uh hacking tech all that good

1042
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,559
stuff and she talks at conferences uh

1043
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,320
the story i wanna talk about with hers

1044
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,159
is it's again the content creating

1045
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:12,240
things she was learning how to do a

1046
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,919
single sign-on hacking for example she

1047
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:15,039
wanted to learn how to do that she would

1048
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,640
learn it she'll make a video on it

1049
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,799
present it and put it on youtube and she

1050
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:21,039
has done that with a handful of them and

1051
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:23,360
then not too long ago

1052
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,600
buckrad also hired her and she's now a

1053
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,519
manager for a triage team in her region

1054
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,120
within a couple of years

1055
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,480
so another story to tell about people

1056
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,600
are creating content i don't think she

1057
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,600
does bug brownies or actively hacks on

1058
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,600
anything but just to ask that she wanted

1059
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,279
to learn she put her journey on youtube

1060
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,279
for black bounty hunters like herself

1061
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:40,640
and she scored her job because she was

1062
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,399
so good at explaining things and

1063
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:44,240
communicating them to a non-technical

1064
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,000
audience

1065
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,720
but it's not just youtube content uh the

1066
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,240
people that are writing books i know

1067
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,679
joe's here and under cory's here they're

1068
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:52,799
doing books

1069
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,200
not really super related bug bounties

1070
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,679
but you guys remember this guy peter

1071
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:00,159
so he uh originally before he started

1072
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:01,919
doing black bounties full-time or

1073
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,000
part-time what we want to call it he put

1074
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,240
a book together with an e-book all he

1075
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,600
was doing was

1076
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,280
looking at hacker wants activity so

1077
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,918
hacker one has a page called hacka1.com

1078
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:14,639
activity where every

1079
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,960
researcher or company can mutually agree

1080
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,520
whether or not they want to publish a

1081
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,119
bug that has been found so he was

1082
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,199
looking at in every single one of them

1083
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,119
and he was compiling him in a book and

1084
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:26,960
he was explaining how these bugs were

1085
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,040
found why was the reason why this blog

1086
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,480
worked how did it work what was the

1087
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,079
impact and he put into an e-book like

1088
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:32,879
this

1089
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,719
and people were buying him for 10 or 20

1090
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,719
dollars and then a few years later he

1091
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,800
was a published author uh for the book

1092
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,480
real world bug hunting

1093
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,679
a field guide to uh web hacking

1094
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,359
purely from bug bounties i think the

1095
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:47,280
book still uses some of those reports

1096
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,199
from what i remember but just to show

1097
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,639
before he was above country before he

1098
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,679
was hired by shopify he was doing this

1099
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,839
book uh part time and he you know gave

1100
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:57,760
him a lot of opportunities because he

1101
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,720
was putting something really cool

1102
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,160
together and then later on it became

1103
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,440
this book

1104
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,280
uh vicky lee

1105
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,560
is another author i'm not sure if you

1106
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,960
guys are familiar with her her book is

1107
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,960
very good i would really recommend it if

1108
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,160
you're especially true bug bound if

1109
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,680
you're new to it it's a great book to

1110
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,480
read

1111
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,480
both of those together but she was also

1112
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,320
the same kind of concept she was working

1113
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,560
as an optic engineer she's a great

1114
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,240
blogger if you go to her blog it's

1115
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,079
wikilea.medium.com

1116
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,920
the way she explains technical things

1117
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,520
it's incredible i wish i could

1118
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,720
communicate the way she does in

1119
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,240
technical terms

1120
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,839
but she started making security content

1121
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:32,160
on her site she has some youtube videos

1122
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,000
and then later on she also came out with

1123
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,839
this book which covers a lot of

1124
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:37,520
vulnerabilities that are very common in

1125
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,520
bug bounties and also you know it's

1126
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,280
being which is a published author with

1127
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,640
something related to black brownies

1128
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,680
itself

1129
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,440
there are also courses and trainings

1130
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,079
there's a ton of them uh this guy was a

1131
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,320
very smart uh hacker who did a lot of

1132
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,400
cool stuff with his content

1133
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,640
his name is zeeshano he's a hacker based

1134
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,280
out of the uk he was uh the top hacker

1135
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,359
on buck for a while until he got banned

1136
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:00,640
unfortunately

1137
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,000
he was very well known for hacking

1138
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,160
amazon and tripadvisor

1139
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,800
and he also makes uh content on youtube

1140
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,119
you can look him up at zisano

1141
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,359
he sat down one year and he wrote his

1142
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:13,839
entire methodology into a form of a book

1143
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,359
and he thought he could sell an e-book

1144
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:16,480
online on the internet without it

1145
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,040
getting leaked unfortunately uh being on

1146
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,320
the internet everything gets sleek

1147
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,400
including his book but then he pivoted

1148
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,280
he created this thing called the uh it's

1149
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,599
called bugbountyhunter.com where he's

1150
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,920
created a fake infrastructure and he

1151
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,280
personally asks you to find

1152
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,880
vulnerabilities just like a bug boundary

1153
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,520
program you write a report to him in

1154
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,359
some cases he pays you for those reports

1155
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:38,720
that fake vulnerability is not a real

1156
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,480
company but he pays you for it and he

1157
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,400
tells you what to do to get your reports

1158
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,400
to be better and he has i want to say he

1159
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,880
has created black bounty hunters a dozen

1160
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,640
of them at least that i know of because

1161
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,000
he has spent this time to do it with

1162
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,920
them it's a one-time fee to get on his

1163
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,839
website but it just goes to show a

1164
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:55,359
hacker who has hacked you know verizon

1165
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:58,160
media uh some gambling sites hyatt

1166
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,880
zendesk dropbox paypal put it on our

1167
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,880
website he's just full time doing this

1168
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,760
and investing his money in trading

1169
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,599
cryptocurrencies right now and making

1170
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,680
more money just to go to show he's taken

1171
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,000
that knowledge put on a website created

1172
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,440
a resource for people and people are

1173
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,440
he's paying people to learn and also

1174
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,200
they're taking that knowledge taking it

1175
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,839
somewhere else and making money from it

1176
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:21,359
there's also udemy courses there's

1177
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:23,040
hundreds of thousands of them

1178
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,119
people have made tons of courses on bug

1179
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:27,119
bounties or web hacking it's a big part

1180
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,119
of it but again it

1181
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,200
there's another entire avenue of making

1182
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,720
money with this there's startups that

1183
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,280
have been created by bug bounty hunters

1184
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,119
either by them or for black bounty

1185
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:39,440
hunters a great example is this guy that

1186
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,160
i talked about shabs shabham shah he is

1187
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,960
the founder of a company called asset

1188
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,400
note and i'll talk about a little bit

1189
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,880
he's also another hakka one elite he is

1190
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,640
and i don't know how this guy's brains

1191
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,359
brain works he knows how to rip a

1192
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,680
application on infrastructure in a

1193
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,079
heartbeat and he has made tons of money

1194
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,440
from it i think he's close to a million

1195
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,599
if he hasn't passed a million dollars uh

1196
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:03,200
he was doing it as a moonlighter at

1197
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,240
first before he founded his company

1198
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,320
but he was doing it as a part-time he

1199
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,560
was working full-time and at night he

1200
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,320
wanted to get better he had the time and

1201
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,480
he was making a ton of money

1202
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,400
especially not at airlines they were

1203
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,400
giving out miles and i want to say he

1204
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,720
had maybe 10 million miles at some point

1205
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,079
to the point that he was saying i don't

1206
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,280
know what to do with these like there's

1207
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,520
so many pets that can fly first class

1208
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,800
that i can use all these miles and i

1209
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,240
think he still has a ton of them and he

1210
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,520
still hacks them

1211
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,599
but going back to his company he founded

1212
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:34,320
this company called asset note the

1213
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,720
entire team is a bunch of bug bounty

1214
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,160
hunters

1215
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,400
they've no vc funding backing them at

1216
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,320
all everything has been done by him and

1217
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,599
his team i think from what i understand

1218
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,320
and they pretty much have put their

1219
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,320
brains together especially shobs as

1220
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,920
brain into a methodology of how they

1221
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,760
find these different assets and how they

1222
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,920
automate to make money or actually find

1223
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,920
vulnerabilities for their customers and

1224
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,520
then on the side they use the same

1225
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,280
technology to scan other block boundary

1226
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,280
programs are not their customers in

1227
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,040
hopes of becoming a customer also making

1228
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,960
more money from it so he was one of the

1229
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,560
first to you know take his knowledge and

1230
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,720
take his money he has made and put it

1231
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,200
into a company and investing in himself

1232
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,320
and hopefully they'll make something

1233
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,839
beautiful out of it

1234
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:18,880
geekboi he's another hacker out of india

1235
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,040
he was uh he was an ex-hacker one triage

1236
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,960
member he was also a hacker won a lead

1237
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,359
he has had companies like yelp udemy

1238
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:28,640
rockstar games att uh a bunch of other

1239
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,880
ones but he just left hacker one one day

1240
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,960
is like nope i'm done i want to start my

1241
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,960
own company not only i want to do it for

1242
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,960
the enterprise side but i also want to

1243
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,520
do it for the community so a lot of the

1244
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,359
tools that you may be familiar by a show

1245
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:44,960
of hands anyone know the tool nuclei

1246
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,040
for you okay so nuclear is one of the

1247
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,079
tools that a lot of the offensive

1248
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:50,720
security people use that fingerprints uh

1249
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,400
every single asset that you scan so you

1250
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,680
find an asset it tells you this is what

1251
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,280
it runs they wrote that they open

1252
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,720
sourced it the entire community

1253
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,280
contributed to it there are

1254
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,760
other tools like httpx subfinder naboo

1255
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,160
dnsx a ton of other things and

1256
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,680
everything again is on github if you go

1257
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,839
to github.com

1258
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:09,520
project discovery i think is their

1259
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,560
handle

1260
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,560
everything is there you can use them

1261
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,960
they also created this platform

1262
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,880
project discovery.io

1263
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,800
i haven't seen it myself it's on it's a

1264
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,319
demo right now it's been in a demo for

1265
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:23,440
three years but every day they release

1266
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,920
target listings for bug bounty hunters

1267
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,680
so for example yahoo and google are a

1268
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,839
bug bounty program every single asset

1269
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:32,960
owned by yahoo is indexed on chaos for

1270
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,400
free to download and if you have an

1271
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,480
access or api key they give you more

1272
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,000
information and i think they're hoping

1273
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,920
to go to enterprise route to get

1274
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,200
customers to onboard and sign their data

1275
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,800
but wait there's more we're almost done

1276
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,079
i promise

1277
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,000
i talked a lot about you know

1278
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,160
content creators i talked about

1279
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,000
bug bounty hunter i talked about asset

1280
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,520
no every different avenue that people

1281
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,760
have made money but i don't want to

1282
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,359
leave it there as like this you know

1283
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:58,560
glorified things are like look

1284
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,000
everyone's making money doing business

1285
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,520
and doing these things people have done

1286
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,440
other cool things i just wanted to ask

1287
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,480
like hey

1288
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,560
did you do anything

1289
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,079
more meaningful than investing in

1290
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:10,960
yourself uh people starting a charity

1291
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,240

these two brothers

1314
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,480
they came out of india and they both

1315
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,920
were one of them was in school one of

1316
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,000
them was in i.t and they both helped

1317
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,760
their parents retire and not only retire

1318
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,240
their parents so one of them i don't

1319
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,680
remember their names i haven't seen them

1320
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,920
in years but the younger one goes to

1321
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,920
college and they both find about find

1322
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,839
out what bug bounties are

1323
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:17,359
he drops out of college to do bug

1324
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:18,800
bounties full time and then they're

1325
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,400
supporting their family and each other

1326
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,839
and then the brother quits his job and

1327
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:23,200
joins them and they full-time do bug

1328
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,599
boundaries out of india and they really

1329
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:28,000
entirely just gradually uh retired their

1330
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,800
parents and brought him at home and

1331
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,839
anything that they could have done

1332
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:33,599
probably in the next 10 15 years they

1333
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,160
would be able to do it in a few years by

1334
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,839
just doing bug bounties

1335
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:40,960
and my favorite one is i actually

1336
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,400
hosted a conference

1337
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,400
very focused on bug bounties and we

1338
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,359
ended up raising uh 52 000 and donated

1339
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:50,000
every single dollar of it to leukemia

1340
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,880
lymphoma society and i want to say a

1341
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,800
large majority of the donations at least

1342
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,640
half of them came directly from the

1343
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,560
black bounty hunters our mention in the

1344
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,319
story and the other half was from

1345
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:01,599
corporate sponsorships and people that

1346
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:03,839
had a bug bounty program and it all went

1347
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:06,240
to a good cause of the good research

1348
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,000
all right now let's bring it full circle

1349
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,280
i think i have like

1350
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,200
five more minutes to finish this i'm

1351
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,880
going to go through this very quickly so

1352
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,040
there's time for a qa i talked to a lot

1353
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,640
of people i didn't talk about myself i

1354
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,920
want to keep that for the ending to kind

1355
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,680
of show you uh why i told you all this

1356
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,760

1360
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:28,480

hacking one elite

1365
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,119
i've had all these different companies

1366
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:38,560
talked about a little bit

1367
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,280
i

1368
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,800
barely knew anything about the web in

1369
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,240
college i've done hacking but it was

1370
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,240
like copy pasting payloads didn't know

1371
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,079
what it did really i just knew xss

1372
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,079
existed um

1373
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:49,680
i spent a lot of my time in college and

1374
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,760
digital marketing advertisement

1375
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,480
and i wanted to i've gone from every

1376
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,920
profile that i've mentioned from the

1377
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,240
moonlight to careerist

1378
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,880
uh to the person i want to learn the

1379
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,599
learner i've done all of them and i've

1380
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:04,880
created some business because of bug

1381
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,240
bounties if it wasn't for that i

1382
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,400
wouldn't have been able to so i

1383
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,079
originally got my first

1384
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,400
real engineering job at hulu because i

1385
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,920
found a vulnerability in one of their

1386
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,800
assets submitted it to them a year later

1387
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,599
exactly i interviewed for a position

1388
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:20,880
and i worked for them for nine months

1389
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,040
helped them build a bug bounty program

1390
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,560
and then i wasn't a big fan of hacker

1391
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,240
one i criticized the crap out of the

1392
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,280
company

1393
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,720
on twitter for a while and then they

1394
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,079
killed me with kindness brought me over

1395
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,319
to their office and i ended up being an

1396
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:34,560
intern there i worked on the triage team

1397
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,400
i moved up to customer success you name

1398
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,160
it and towards the end i ended up

1399
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,520
working as the head of hacker education

1400
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,760
for them and now i'm the vp of a brand

1401
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,680
new startup

1402
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,119
but i realized that i really enjoyed

1403
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,280
hacking but i want to have an impact on

1404
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,640
people's lives i want to do more than

1405
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,400
that i wanted to be able to share my

1406
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,920
story with other people

1407
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,839
i started creating content so i have a

1408
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:56,240
youtube channel and twitch uh i pretty

1409
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,920
much let people look over my shoulder so

1410
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,280
they can learn how to hack and i know a

1411
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,480
handful of people that have reached out

1412
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,319
to me and i'm like hey i watched your

1413
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:04,000
streams a couple of months i got my

1414
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,079

1419
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,000
messaged me saying he got his first pen

1420
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,760
test gig that went from 12 an hour to 45

1421
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:20,800
an hour

1422
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,640
uh he was working hourly and then he

1423
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,240
also messaged me not too long ago he

1424
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,560
said i just got my full-time job and i'm

1425
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,920
making the most amount of money i've

1426
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,240
ever made in my life because i watch

1427
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,680
people do things and i put in the time

1428
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:32,880
and effort to get out of what i was

1429
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,200
doing already

1430
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,640
but that wasn't enough for me i wanted

1431
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,240
to do more i want to get into public

1432
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,200
speaking so i started going to

1433
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,520
conferences i've talked at a handful of

1434
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,680
b-science conferences appsec

1435
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,599
shellacon i've had the pleasure to work

1436
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,520
out where i work with def con i help

1437

1438
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,119
opsec village now so he wanted to get

1439
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:53,280
really get out there and do more

1440
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,079
when conferences were shut down and

1441
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:57,599
during the pandemic i was really bummed

1442
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:59,280
that i couldn't go to any conferences i

1443
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,599
try to go to every conference i can

1444
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:03,920
i would pretty much say never say no to

1445
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,599
a conference i unless i really can't go

1446
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:06,560
to it

1447
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,920
so i started the two conferences

1448
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,240
versacon which we did in 2020

1449
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,599
unfortunately for

1450
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:13,200
coven it was literally whatever the

1451
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,440
entire world got shut down and there was

1452
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,200
nothing happening that weekend verse

1453
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,720
icon was planned for that weekend and

1454
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:19,920
everybody came and watched it which

1455
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,839
helped out and i also created no hong

1456
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:23,839
kong which no homecoming actually uh

1457
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:26,079
turned three this year i just did uh our

1458
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:29,119
last edition last month and

1459
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,040
we had 9 000 people playing our ctf

1460
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,599
across 3 000 teams and

1461
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:35,280
companies were you know helping us put

1462
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,800
it together and some other people that i

1463
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,800
showed for example shops zlz there were

1464
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,240
also speakers

1465
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,640
at the conference what i'm trying to get

1466
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,400
to is that everything that i've

1467
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,920
mentioned in the past couple of minutes

1468
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,480
that i've done was purely because people

1469
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,400
on the internet were brave enough to

1470
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,920
trust other people on the internet to

1471
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,160
find bugs in their assets and they you

1472
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,440
know in their

1473
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,319
products and pay them so all of this

1474
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:00,400
said if you want to get into bug

1475
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,760
bounties it's not late it doesn't have

1476
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,520
to be bug bounties alone

1477
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,880
it could be anything you want to do it

1478
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,280
could be anything with hacking again the

1479
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,960
good thing with the commuting hacking is

1480
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,480
that you could do anything you want you

1481
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,160
could you could be anywhere you want in

1482
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,920
your life it doesn't matter you can get

1483
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,119
started today some of the people that

1484
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:17,760
i've shown that were in the 30s 40s i

1485
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,040
know people are in their 50s are still

1486
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,319
getting started so it's never too late

1487
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,079
to get started with this whether you

1488
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:23,200
want to get into red teaming you want to

1489
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,200
get your first certificate uh whether

1490
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,800
the bug bounties hacking whatever that

1491
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,200
is so quick bug boundary resources

1492
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,040
i showed these three books uh the two

1493
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,319
are the same

1494
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:34,000
i would definitely recommend getting the

1495
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,559
last two for bug bounty specifically

1496
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:37,920
they cover a lot of stuff that you need

1497
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,319
to know um i know there's two other

1498
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:41,359
people that i have from the same

1499
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,119
publishers that have books downstairs

1500
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:45,440
also highly recommend them uh

1501
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,880
they touch on things that you can use

1502
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,720
for black bounty hunting as well but

1503
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,000
those two were the ones that really

1504
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,079
stood out to me and i can actually talk

1505
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:53,200
about them

1506
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,400
there are three

1507
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,079
different websites you can go to the

1508
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:57,920
first one is called hacker 101 it's a

1509
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,160
platform owned by hacker one they have a

1510
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:03,200
ctf you go do the ctf on their platform

1511
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,200
if you solve enough ctf levels they give

1512
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,880
you an invite to a private program where

1513
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,480
you can make money and you can start

1514
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,920
building your resume with them and get

1515
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,000
invited to more programs uh website

1516
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,559
academy by port sugar incredible i

1517
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:16,240
highly recommend it it teaches you how

1518
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,760
to use burp suite and also teaches you a

1519
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,520
lot of good stuff for hacking and then

1520
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,760
hackerone.com activity you can see other

1521
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,440
people's research that have been

1522
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,839
publicly disclosed on hacker one

1523
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:27,920
uh bug bounty hunter that i talked about

1524
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,440
pentester lab is a great resource i

1525
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,680
think it's about 14 a month

1526
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,520
if you if you want to have a structured

1527
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,599
course try udemy i don't recommend it

1528
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:36,880
even to have a course myself i still

1529
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,720
don't recommend you that you do uh stick

1530
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,079
to one of the other platforms like try

1531
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:42,079
hack me hack the box panters to lab and

1532
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:43,520
bug bounty hunter and the reason why i

1533
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,200
don't recommend udemy is you learn

1534
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,960
things in theory if you need that great

1535
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,720
go sign up for your demi course well the

1536
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,400
hands-on things are what teaches you the

1537
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,359
most

1538
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:52,800
especially with try hacking they have

1539
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,800
rooms and they have paths that you can

1540
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,640
learn to build up your skill sets so if

1541
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,800
you know nothing about cyber security to

1542
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,319
have a prerequisite class that you can

1543
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:01,920
take and then it tells you now that you

1544
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,119
have done this through the basics of

1545
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:05,680
networking basic self-hacking web app

1546
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:06,880
and you can just keep going down those

1547
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,319
rooms

1548
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:10,240
uh twitter is a great resource i dropped

1549
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,920
a lot of names on there honestly go on

1550
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,359
you if you're shy you don't want to

1551
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:15,119
tweet go on twitter and follow a lot of

1552
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,599
people uh jason haddax is a good example

1553
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:19,599
he does threads every day about how to

1554
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:22,160
do x y and z it's a new one every day uh

1555
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,079
youtube there is no shortage of content

1556
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:26,640
creators nowadays you can get a ton of

1557
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,800
different people creating content to

1558
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,400
learn and then go on github github has a

1559
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,400
lot of github pages that have a lot of

1560
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,839
resources in them

1561
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:35,680
and last but not least if you did enjoy

1562
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,359
the stories that i told you every sunday

1563
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:39,040
i mentioned i do a stream i bring out

1564
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,480
some of these top hackers or people that

1565
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,520
have done something in the community

1566
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,520
that the story they want to tell our

1567
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,599
interviewer was every sunday on twitch

1568
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:47,200
and you can come hear more about them

1569
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,040
and learn hands-on from them

1570
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,960
and i think that's all i have thank you

1571
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,119
for listening

1572
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,599
yeah absolutely i would love to

1573
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:09,040
anybody he has

1574
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,599
any questions i will run the mic to you

1575
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:14,559
ah i see one

1576
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,319
uh hi that that was really interesting

1577
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:22,960
um my question is do you think bounties

1578
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,040
are bounty's going up or are they going

1579
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,960
down because it seems like as more

1580
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,960
people get plugged into this it'll be a

1581
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,040
race to the bottom so maybe there won't

1582
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,880
be these career paths because bounties

1583
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,319
will just be lower

1584
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:36,160
on the other hand as more companies

1585
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,880
start programs then we have to attract

1586
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,400
hackers so we have to like pay

1587
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,160
commensurate bounties so which way do

1588
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,359
you think it's going

1589
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:45,280
from what i have seen it's going up more

1590
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,559
just like you mentioned just like

1591
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:47,760
there's more hackers coming up there are

1592
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,359
more companies being open to doing bug

1593
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:51,760
bounties apple would never pay for a web

1594
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,520
app vulnerability they just started

1595
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,440
doing that a few years ago

1596
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,280
i think it's going up as much as there's

1597
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,640
more hackers coming there's also more

1598
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,240
programs being launched

1599
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:01,760
and i've seen the bounty amounts go

1600
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:02,960
higher and higher and higher and higher

1601
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,319
i know they're getting harder and harder

1602
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,160
to find but also the money you're

1603
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,359
getting the average money you're getting

1604
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:08,720
paid is becoming higher and higher from

1605
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,240
some of these companies

1606
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,240
i think verizon media went from like

1607
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,960
average of 10k for a critical right now

1608
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,960
they paid 20 25 000

1609
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,240
so that average has gone higher and

1610
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,480
higher as we you know more companies

1611
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,720
come through

1612
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,359
anyone else

1613
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,000
yeah

1614
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,359
so for a beginner do you think it's

1615
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:36,400
better to

1616
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,800
do ctfs or start to try to find bugs and

1617
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,200
programs or just do a vix of both

1618
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,440
a mix of both i would say definitely try

1619
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:46,000
you know pentester lab hack the boxer

1620
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,280
unfortunately they're not free they cost

1621
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,599
a little bit of money but it's not a you

1622
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:51,839
know it's not as expensive about oscp

1623
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:53,280
you're paying 20 bucks a month depending

1624
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,400
on how much time you spend you can learn

1625
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,559
a lot and i would honestly say go hack

1626
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:57,760
on

1627
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,760
loan disclosure programs those are

1628
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,680
companies that don't pay they just

1629
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,680
accept your vulnerabilities a lot of

1630
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,200
these top hackers aren't going to waste

1631
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,400
their time on those and i mean waste

1632
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,400
because they want to make money but i

1633
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,000
personally have that's what i started as

1634
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,599
well i went on these you know dod has a

1635
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:14,720
program that's free gm ibm they all have

1636
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,640
programs that can go hack on and learn i

1637
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,319
would say focus on those until you have

1638
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:20,319
a methodology of how you look for bugs

1639
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:22,079
and then you can go to a bug bounty

1640
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:23,359
because this way you can get experience

1641
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:25,760
on how do i look for xss what is recon

1642
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,680
what is this a lot of the top hackers

1643
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,359
aren't going to spend time on these free

1644
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:30,240
programs because they're not going to

1645
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,079
make money from it so it's a really

1646
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:34,240
really good place to go do these ctfs

1647
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,319
learn specific things and take that

1648
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:37,520
knowledge and hack on these programs

1649
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:41,720
like dod and find bugs on them

1650
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,800
does it seem like more companies are

1651
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,720
starting to offer bug bounty programs is

1652
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:53,520
there

1653
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,359
some type of data that they're seeing

1654
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:57,760
companies that offer bug bounties are

1655
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,119
having less

1656
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:01,920
uh malicious attacks versus

1657
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,079
companies that don't offer it

1658
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:05,359
i don't think there's ever going to be

1659
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:07,280
company selling less malicious attacks

1660
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,200
but the question is like

1661
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,319
no one's going to stop hacking your

1662
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:11,280
company

1663
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,040
you know black cats are always going to

1664
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,640
go after your products why not let

1665
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,559
people do it legally and then they can

1666
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:18,079
help you uh

1667
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:19,680
prevent it i can't say bug money is well

1668
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:22,160
prevented in any way but there has been

1669
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,680
times i've seen vulnerabilities come out

1670
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,119
that could have caused a lot of issues

1671
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,640
for a particular company

1672
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,079
that would have probably not been found

1673
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,440
uh through a regular pen test and these

1674
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,559
companies are doing multi-million dollar

1675
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:32,480
pen tests also uh nothing against

1676
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,240
pentester vitals i'm just saying like

1677
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,599
with people that are working as

1678
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:36,960
freelancers

1679
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,319
they're not getting paid by the hour

1680
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:39,599
they have to get their return for their

1681
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:41,680
time so they go for the maximum impact

1682
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,359
versus looking for you know os top 10

1683
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:44,720
that sort of stuff if you're a pen

1684
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,160
tester please don't come after me

1685
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,359
they're both great things to do it's

1686
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:48,160
just

1687
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,720
it's different

1688
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,839
hi i was just curious how often is it

1689
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:55,920
that you have to haggle over the

1690
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,280
severity

1691
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,880
when you do find a bug

1692
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,960
in order to get a bounty that

1693
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,720
you know you deserve

1694
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,880
for me personally my experience is not a

1695
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,440
lot it's happened a few times it depends

1696
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,520
on the company first and also

1697
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,440
as a hacker i get way excited like this

1698
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:12,800
it's got to be a critical the moment i

1699
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,400
find it then the more and more they

1700
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:15,599
explain it makes sense there's been

1701
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:17,040
times when i've offered like hey can we

1702
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,800
go on a phone call where i can explain

1703
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,559
to you why i think it's a critical vote

1704
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:22,880
versus a you know a high but also we

1705
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,200
have cvss i know it's not the best tool

1706
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,640
to use out there but we've seen this as

1707
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,000
you can calculate and say why it's a

1708
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,160
critical and i would break down why i

1709
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,079
think you know the the confidentiality

1710
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:33,920
integrity are high because of these

1711
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:36,079
reasons so i really tried my reports if

1712
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:37,280
i know a company has never worked with

1713
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:38,799
me in the past or i feel like i'm not

1714
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:40,480
going to get paid i will try and break

1715
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,240
down why i think it's you know more

1716
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,839
impact than they can tell but also

1717
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:44,960
sometimes these companies don't know

1718
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,559
their own products you know the engineer

1719
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:48,000
just started last month they have no

1720
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
idea what this asset does so explaining

1721
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,520
those things has helped but it still

1722
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:54,319
happens you just have to be able to get

1723
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:56,799
have a given the benefit of the doubt

1724
00:54:56,799 --> 00:54:58,960
uh going with good intent and usually i

1725
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,480
want to say 9 or 10 times i've worked

1726
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,799
with me

1727
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:08,400
all right another hand for ben that's

1728
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,140
our keynote

1729
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:13,100
[Applause]
