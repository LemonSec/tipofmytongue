[Music]

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:03,740
[Applause]

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:09,880
[Music]

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,120
[Applause]

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,080
okay

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,240
so nice to meet you all

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,560
and today we're going to talk about

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,000
something regarding the bot communities

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,760
what are they talking about what are

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,199
their struggles hard they are trying to

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,080
evade those detection techniques and how

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,000
they're trying to actually create tools

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,640
for their fraudsters like tools for

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,440
fraudsters by fraudsters and actually

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,000
they're trying to utilize tools which

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,680
are actually legit

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,280
and making them

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,760
become doing things that are not quite

19
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,960
legit

20
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,200
so

21
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,000
let's try the clicker

22
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,559
okay

23
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,039
it's a bit slow but we can do it

24
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,840
so we're gonna go over like four things

25
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,000
uh the first thing we're gonna talk

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,760
about is threat intelligence this is

27
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,680
actually regarding those communities

28
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,200
what they're talking about what's

29
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,360
happening behind the scenes of their

30
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,560
communities and and then we're going to

31
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,360
show a quick demo of what's a reverse

32
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,400
engineering tool because we know that

33
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,720
they know we're looking at them so it

34
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,360
means that they have tools where they're

35
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,400
using in order to find the things that

36
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,240
we're trying to track they're trying to

37
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,280
detect

38
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,439
even the challenges we're making on them

39
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,720
and eventually we're gonna have a quick

40
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,520
like runner-up on some attack tool and

41
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,720
the exploratory view of what's happening

42
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,200
over there and what are they looking at

43
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,079
and

44
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,360
yeah

45
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,600
so

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,119
yeah

47
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,960
okay so uh

48
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,439
let's just begin with the the first

49
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,920
thing threat intelligence is again

50
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,520
what's happening and the frauds

51
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,520
community today

52
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,320
so

53
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,439
we're gonna show uh what's happening in

54
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,440
those communities regarding

55
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,599
what are they looking at what are the

56
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,840
security vendor what is the mechanism

57
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,080
behind the target's defense

58
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,400
what are the sdks which are protecting

59
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,239
those actual targets and again struggles

60
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:23,920
and what's going on behind the scene in

61
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,879
terms of chatter so the first

62
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,800
thing i want to show you which is quite

63
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,920
interesting to understand

64
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,840
we can make

65
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,959
it yes

66
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,080
we'll make it

67
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,640
so the the first and most important

68
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,400
thing they're looking at it's not

69
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,720
actually the target which is they're

70
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,040
attacking they are not attacking tick

71
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,680
tock they are not attacking chase back

72
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,440
they're not attacking wells fargo

73
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,599
they're actually attacking the security

74
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,560
vendor which is protecting those targets

75
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,040
that means that they're not asking

76
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,920
what do i need to do in order to bypass

77
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,400
wells fargo defenses they are asking who

78
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,680
is protecting wells fargo and how do i

79
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,959
overcome it so we have a few examples

80
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,760
actually of what's happening over there

81
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,120
we can see an example of one big vendor

82
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,599
another big vendor over here we can see

83
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,680
that they're not just looking at the

84
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,599
vendor which is uh

85
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,319
really defending those targets they're

86
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,519
actually looking at the version of the

87
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,319
sdk which is running in the back side of

88
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,879
this vendor which is protecting those

89
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,519
targets it means that they are aware

90
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:38,319
that

91
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,400
if this target if

92
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,400
that site is running

93
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,000
1.6

94
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,120
maybe it's

95
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,560
different than 1.75 and i need to behave

96
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,519
myself i need to overcome a different

97
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,840
features in those

98
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,040
different sdks so it's really important

99
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,200
to understand that they are quite aware

100
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,720
of what's happening behind the scene and

101
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,040
i'm going to show you another uh

102
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,239
fun example of what's actually happening

103
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,400
if you can see over here they're

104
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,840
actually looking at our release cycles

105
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,879
they're just actually watching they're

106
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,600
they have their own mechanism to see if

107
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,639
you know if we're looking at uh we're

108
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,919
just updating our sdk over one site and

109
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,720
we're like 1.7 and now we want to go

110
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,720
over to 1.8 and we skipped 1.75 then

111
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,720
maybe even have a laugh about that and

112
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,800
we'll talk about our release cycle our

113
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,520
production behind the scene so this is

114
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,919
nice to see that some of them are

115
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,759
actually looking at that and if you can

116
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,639
see over at the bottom you can see that

117
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,360
some things are actually interesting to

118
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,800
them in terms of release cycles because

119
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,040
does anybody know which one runs only

120
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,800
1.7 because i can't deal with 1.75 so

121
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,639
this is actually important from their

122
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,880
end

123
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,360
another thing which is quite interesting

124
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,240
to have a look at is what they're trying

125
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,120
to look in terms of the actual scripts

126
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,960
is running in the background of the

127
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,320
target site they're not just looking in

128
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,840
terms of

129
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,840
what things are running there and what

130
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,520
is being collected on them and they're

131
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,120
trying to

132
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,759
have a go and maybe it works maybe it

133
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,320
doesn't they're actually trying to do

134
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,960
reverse engineering uh on the actual

135
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,960
scripts because i don't know if you are

136
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,160
familiar with

137
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,479
defense scripts or running and

138
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,720
background of sight i don't know if any

139
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,560
of you tried to scrape try to do uh

140
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,600
login

141
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,360
credential stuffing

142
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,400
maybe

143
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,400
like sometimes in the past i don't know

144
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,199
i know i tried and it's quite hard to

145
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,360
understand what scripts are running over

146
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,280
there and it's quite hard to understand

147
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,520
what is being collected on all over you

148
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,400
so

149
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,240
over here you can see that they're

150
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,479
actually giving grades to obfuscation

151
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,440
levels of different vendors

152
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,479
it means that i know that i can go over

153
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,400
to one vendor and i know it's easier

154
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,800
than the other vendor maybe it's as hard

155
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,199
as this vendor but the hardest one is

156
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,360
this one so maybe you need to take a

157
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,720
look at

158
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,080
the the very easy one and maybe try to

159
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,120
do it first or maybe try to solve the

160
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,759
very hard one and maybe sell it to the

161
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,919
highest bidder so it's really good to

162
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,479
understand that they're not just looking

163
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:31,280
at

164
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,960
what's being collected on them they're

165
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,199
actually trying to de-obfuscate those

166
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,759
scripts they want to know what fields

167
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,520
are being collected on them what

168
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,680
challenges are being made to their

169
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,000
browsers because it's really hard to

170
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
know what's happening behind the scene

171
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,479
without understanding those calls and

172
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,120
without seeing what's happening actually

173
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,880
in terms of the

174
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,680
security defender

175
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,400
this is a quite interesting look at

176
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,880
what's happening in those forums again

177
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,520
all those pictures are taken from

178
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,759
quite legit places over discord servers

179
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,520
i heard that you talked about list code

180
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,919
just earlier so this is the same thing

181
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,880
and as we can see here those are three

182
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,240
examples of scripts being de-obfuscated

183
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,560
by those processors by those pratt

184
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,479
actors and as you can see here those

185
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,120
uh quite few interesting fields which is

186
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,720
interesting to see

187
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,199
as you can see the first one is a

188
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,319
plugins and mime types that's maybe

189
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,120
vague for some people but for those who

190
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,440
try to evade those detection are really

191
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,080
aware of them and they know that those

192
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,800
fields might suggest that something

193
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,879
fishy is happening behind the scenes and

194
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,879
the second example we can see that

195
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,280
they're looking specifically at phantom

196
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,160
web driver dom automation those are like

197
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,560
fields that flag specifically that's

198
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,479
happening automation behind the scene

199
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,879
those are really good to know for the

200
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,960
beginner fraudster for the beginning

201
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,560
bought attacker but

202
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,039
that's nice to see nice to show that

203
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,720
something is happening behind the scene

204
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,360
and the last script it's actually

205
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,039
quite nice i don't know if you can read

206
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,800
it but that's

207
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,840
being taken from an sdk of a security

208
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,520
vendor and i don't know if you can see

209
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,759
it's saying you can't hide so it's quite

210
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,039
funny because

211
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,199
you can't hide was supposed to be

212
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,680
obfuscated and no one should read it but

213
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,080
now we can so

214
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,159
i don't know if you can hide this is the

215
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,159
right sentence for that it's quite

216
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,440
arrogant

217
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,279
okay

218
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,479
let's talk about their struggles so

219
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,880
i want to have a quick

220
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,480
like maybe

221
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,120
summarization of what do you think

222
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,920
is a struggle which is a bot

223
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,120
attacker is suffering from

224
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,680
from you

225
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,160
if you have any

226
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,040
okay

227
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,560
i'm going to give it maybe 10 more

228
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,600
seconds

229
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,120
cool so

230
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,360
as we mentioned earlier

231
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,399
what

232
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,360
yeah i can see

233
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,760
authentication problems so what do you

234
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,120
mean by authentication problems

235
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,320
yeah so maybe the first step is actually

236
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,920
yeah the authentication they're having

237
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,080
an account and they're trying to

238
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,040
do those actual steps in order to see

239
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,200
what's happening what's the right

240
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,519
flow of things which are happening and

241
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,000
this is a good point because in order to

242
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,800
scale up the operation they want to do

243
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,440
the first thing the first try and then

244
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,320
take it and do it like multiple times

245
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,000
we're not talking about tens of times

246
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,600
we're not talking about thousands we're

247
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,240
talking about millions and maybe more

248
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,440
so

249
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,440
i'm going to show maybe a nice picture

250
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,839
of struggles which are happening in over

251
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,959
there this is a good example of someone

252
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,440
who is trying to bypass another security

253
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,440
vendor and he's talking about the

254
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,320
techniques that he used what was working

255
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,720
for him what wasn't working for him how

256
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,519
many time of how many times he were able

257
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,200
to bypass those

258
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,000
security methods and people are are

259
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,079
making conversation over this they're

260
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,399
talking about maybe you tried this one

261
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,560
maybe you tried the other one maybe you

262
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,279
should think about doing that or the

263
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,519
other way around and this is quite

264
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,600
interesting to see that in those

265
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,160
societies in those

266
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,519
communities this is really a good part

267
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,079
of sharing knowledge they want to know

268
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,880
they want to teach each other and

269
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,200
maybe we'll mention it in the end but

270
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,560
they actually have a nice way of knowing

271
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,120
that some of us the security researchers

272
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,519
are actually lurking there and sometimes

273
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,800
they uh

274
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,000
share a few snippets for us but maybe

275
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,560
you know one day they will switch sides

276
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,920
or the other way around and we don't

277
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,680
know

278
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,640
so another example of uh something

279
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,320
that's happening over there is someone

280
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,800
again is trying to do amazon sign up

281
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,040
details they're trying to do it in

282
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,680
a scaled way they want to do it like in

283
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,160
very massive and he's getting four or

284
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,399
four he doesn't know why everybody is

285
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,680
trying to suggest maybe the reasons and

286
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,839
i don't know if you mentioned the last

287
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,760
one that's probably it

288
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,519
there isn't maybe

289
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,760
you're just using

290
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,480
a

291
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,720
bright mode color of ide

292
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,880
i don't know maybe that's the reason why

293
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,920
you can't

294
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,920
actually pass it

295
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,800
that was a joke i know

296
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,480
um so

297
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,600
let's just have a last talk of what's

298
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,600
going behind the scenes of the attack

299
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,120
we're trying to talk about some

300
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,480
technical stuff

301
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,880
uh just before we deep

302
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,680
dig deep into the demo itself

303
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,760
so we're talking about uh detection

304
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,480
techniques what people are looking at

305
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,600
what

306
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,120
is happening in terms of us the security

307
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,079
vendors and what they are aware of what

308
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,720
they know is happening so they know

309
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,639
they they know that people are tracking

310
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,720
mouse speeds and free presses they know

311
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,680
that we have good web driver detection

312
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,000
and someone even says that when you have

313
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,399
a web driver and if you can't hide it

314
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,680
that's an immediate block so in order to

315
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,160
bypass those things you need to be aware

316
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,079
of them you need to know how to mimic it

317
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,320
you need to know what's happening what

318
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,639
features you need to mimic you need to

319
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,880
have a good understanding of

320
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,839
what's

321
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,720
looking like a good user what's looking

322
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,720
like a human and what doesn't

323
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,240
so

324
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,800
up until now we had a bit of discussions

325
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,040
what's going on in those communities

326
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,839
right now i'm going to show a quick demo

327
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:56,720
of

328
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,560
tools that were used for fraudsters by

329
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,200
fraud series that's a good example

330
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,399
of

331
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,120
the good sharing uh spirit of those

332
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,519
fraudsters and this is quite interesting

333
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:10,800
to see

334
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,399
i'm gonna

335
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,600
just go to my laptop

336
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,880
okay

337
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,480
yeah

338
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,399
so we're going to have a quick two shows

339
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,560
of two tools which are used by

340
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,199
fraudsters for fraudsters the first one

341
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,639
is called antibot test and just a quick

342
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,720
understanding of what's happened and

343
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,680
this uh in this tool this is an actual

344
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,880
script

345
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,839
that was built by fraudsters in order to

346
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,040
do a

347
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,079
understanding of the targets and what's

348
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,839
happening behind the scenes of the

349
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,680
target regarding the security vendors

350
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,440
who is protecting it

351
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,600
what tools are they using what scripts

352
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,760
are they using what they are collecting

353
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,959
and the second one api sniffer i think

354
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,120
will be much more understood after i

355
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,040
should the first one

356
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,639
so

357
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,360
if we go to antibot test

358
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,880
this is again

359
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,680
a discord and i know if you have tried

360
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,920
it in the past and you've seen it and

361
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,079
how it looked like so as you can see

362
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:34,240
over here this is filled with uh

363
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,959
commands and we can see here that i'm

364
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,920
trying writing antibots and just a

365
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,440
normal site

366
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,800
doesn't matter actually what and if we

367
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,000
run it

368
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,480
right now we see that is trying to

369
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,600
analyze the site itself it's uh going

370
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,839
over all the javascript which is running

371
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,240
in the background and then eventually is

372
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,399
putting out an output of who is

373
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,240
protecting this site what is the

374
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,839
security vendors which is protecting

375
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,880
this site and not just who are they

376
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,440
you can actually see the addresses which

377
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,760
are directing to the specific

378
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,399
places where the scripts are located at

379
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,880
it means that if you are a technical

380
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,680
person you can go and take those scripts

381
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,839
and then go and de-obfuscate them

382
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,079
understand what type of features being

383
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,440
collected at you

384
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,920
what type of challenges are being made

385
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,399
against the browser itself and this is

386
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,120
quite interesting to see

387
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,720
again what's happening someone is

388
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,800
writing hi over there it's interesting

389
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,399
okay

390
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,199
the second one which is

391
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,160
a bit

392
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,680
more technical

393
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,120
uh is

394
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,519
quite different than the other one which

395
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,240
is

396
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,800
very product-wise very ready for to be

397
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,800
used because you understand this one is

398
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,199
being defended by this vendor or not

399
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,360
that vendor and this is really easy to

400
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,279
understand because if i know how to

401
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,320
bypass

402
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,480
a specific vendor i know that

403
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,480
if this vendor is defending this target

404
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,120
i can use it but if i don't know i can

405
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,880
just go on and have my next target so

406
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,000
this script is a bit more fluffier in

407
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,399
terms of it just

408
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,399
returns the specific api calls which are

409
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,320
getting collected from all the

410
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,560
javascripts on the site it doesn't

411
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,079
actually does the actual classification

412
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,639
of which script is

413
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,279
related to which security vendor because

414
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,600
some scripts are not trying to detect

415
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,680
bots some scripts are just trying to

416
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,000
understand the current flow of what's

417
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,600
happening in your site

418
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,000
some scripts are actually being used by

419
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,160
the site owners themselves and not

420
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,519
related to security at all so

421
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,920
here you can see

422
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,279
that this

423
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:57,360
uh actual tool is doing

424
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,199
wait this is not anti-butt we need to do

425
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,319
a different

426
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,319
api sniffer because this is the tool

427
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,600
i just want

428
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,480
what

429
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,199
no so

430
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,679
okay

431
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,360
okay

432
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,840
i'm gonna show you uh just uh maybe an

433
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,200
output of something else because it's

434
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,799
quite difficult to

435
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:45,679
make

436
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,760
to write it on the other screen so i'm

437
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,440
going to show you something which is

438
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,679
interesting to see maybe on some other

439
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,000
target which is interesting to see

440
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,200
so

441
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,400
maybe if we go and look on foot locker

442
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,559
this one is a script i actually ran

443
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:01,679
yesterday

444
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,039
and we're looking at the actual

445
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,600
uh output of this tool and what's

446
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,520
happening in on the background and we

447
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,640
can see here the specific api requests

448
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,039
that were asked by all the scripts that

449
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,160
were running on that site itself so if

450
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,200
we go and have uh maybe a bit of

451
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,440
wandering around we can

452
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,080
eventually we look at the scripts where

453
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,440
they are coming from something that

454
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,000
happened to be a security vendor uh i

455
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,520
will show

456
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,880
one which is

457
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,840
like cloudfront and this is actually

458
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,480
interesting to see that what's happening

459
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,480
behind the scene in terms of what type

460
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,799
of fields are being collected what api

461
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,520
calls are being made from the security

462
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,280
vendor this is interesting to understand

463
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,600
because you don't need to de-obfuscate

464
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,080
the script itself in order to see what

465
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,240
api calls are being collected by the

466
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,440
script itself so it's actually a work in

467
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,120
progress in together in order to

468
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,320
understand uh better what's being

469
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,200
collected on you the threat actor who is

470
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,799
trying to mimic the

471
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,000
uh human interaction

472
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,280
so

473
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,400
let's do

474
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,799
another

475
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,200
quick demo which is

476
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,720
again

477
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,120
gonna be

478
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,679
uh so the next one is about attack tools

479
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,640
exploration and i'm gonna call it the

480
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,039
tactiles i don't i don't know if any one

481
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,360
of you are familiar with puppeteer as an

482
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,000
attack tool or not but puppeteer in

483
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,360
general is a good automation tool which

484
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,679
is meant usually for developers in order

485
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,160
to automate things in order to

486
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,200
understand how their site acts in terms

487
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,840
of sometime from atlas sometimes just

488
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,840
use your chrome and just

489
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,640
for

490
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,440
developer purposes and this is a legit

491
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,120
tool but as we know when someone making

492
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,679
a good legit tool which is helping you

493
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,039
automate things

494
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,360
fraudsters and fat actors can utilize

495
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,200
this tool and try to

496
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,760
take it and scale it up and make it as

497
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,640
an attack tool so as we can see here the

498
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,360
puppeteer actually is

499
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,240
saying is flagging i'm an automation

500
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,960
tool and as you can see or you can

501
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,559
figure that if you are flagging that

502
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,159
you're an automation tool it's not very

503
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,720
good for the fat actors so you need a

504
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,760
way to overcome this you need a way to

505
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,559
evade those things so i'm going to show

506
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,120
you just a quick

507
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,400
wandering around this tool again

508
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,360
from the process community

509
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,640
so this is puppeteer extra

510
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,360
i don't know if you are aware of this

511
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,400
repo but it has 4 000

512
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,080
stars

513
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,960
has many many contributors and it's

514
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,000
really

515
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,440
really being

516
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,400
maintained almost daily as you can see

517
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,360
uh

518
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,600
some of the last pr's were like ten

519
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,080
eight days ago so this is

520
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,840
really uh

521
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,120
cool to see

522
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,400
and if we go specifically into the tools

523
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,400
that i was mentioning because as i

524
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,039
mentioned earlier we want to make a

525
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,280
plugin for this tool that will make it

526
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,919
evade the bot detection the one the tool

527
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,200
that won't flag you as an automation

528
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,000
tool

529
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,240
so as you can see here this is the

530
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,559
puppeteer x itself they are

531
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,559
uh bragging and going into a specific

532
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:40,000
site which is supposed to recognize uh

533
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,840
bots and you're seeing you're not chrome

534
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,799
headless and if we go a little bit

535
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,720
further they're talking about the

536
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,120
specific evasions they added maybe we'll

537
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,440
go into that a bit later

538
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,159
test results without puppeteer

539
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,720
so we're seeing bed is very bad and then

540
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,640
we're going with puppeteer and we're

541
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,880
seeing they're all green again this is

542
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,039
very common knowledge for the bot

543
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,919
detection community uh maybe if you want

544
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,360
to get into that deeper i will uh

545
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,559
gladly

546
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:14,080
share a bit about this and another thing

547
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,720
here is a recaptcha v3 i don't know if

548
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,960
any of you have tried the captcha but

549
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,120
the latest recaptcha which is supposed

550
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,080
to be seamless if you you have a score

551
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,440
which is usually

552
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,000
lower than 0.5 it means that you are a

553
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,640
bot without using a puppeteer extra

554
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,240
stealth you getting 0.1 with using uh

555
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,400
all the stealth evasion techniques you

556
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,440
are getting 0.7 which is actually kind

557
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,480
of good and it's being usually

558
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,360
considered a human or maybe some network

559
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,678
fault

560
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,919
so before we

561
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,240
uh go and have a little bit

562
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,400
look about the evasions here

563
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,200
we can have a clear look on what's being

564
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,919
considered as evasions so maybe remember

565
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,159
earlier from when i talked about

566
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,080
specific plugins or web driver or other

567
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,240
properties of the browser itself which

568
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,760
are mentioning that you are using

569
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,760
automation at the moment

570
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,360
as you can see here we have all kinds of

571
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,919
evasions which are meant to

572
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,880
actually remove those

573
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,880
features and if we can go into

574
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,080
the

575
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,720
for example webdriver we're looking here

576
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,360
activation which is actually passing the

577
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,960
webdriver test this will delete the

578
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,080
navigator.webdriver property it will

579
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,400
take the navigator dot web driver and

580
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,080
we'll delete it and which means

581
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,559
eventually we you will look as a human

582
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,279
as a normal browser

583
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,080
so

584
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,439
uh to sum it all up

585
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,959
sum it all up we're gonna go

586
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,880
okay so we have the best practices

587
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,120
i'm gonna just do a quick uh all of them

588
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,559
so threat intelligence as you can now uh

589
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,640
we need to have an ongoing presence in

590
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,720
the right places you need to understand

591
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,720
what tools are being used in order to

592
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,960
evade your bot detection

593
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,640
you need to have

594
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,200
hands-on the tools being used

595
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,919
this is in order to trace them out of

596
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,120
your traffic in in order to find them

597
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,840
and the latest one you need to always

598
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,720
try to bypass your own systems and this

599
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,520
is of course i know you are aware of if

600
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,799
you're

601
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,960
trying to bypass your own systems you

602
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,559
will probably discover interesting

603
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,880
findings or loopholes that were

604
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,919
happening

605
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,520
in the mid

606
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,080
this is it

607
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,060
thank you
