5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,920
okay hi everyone

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,079
so i'm going to talk today about open

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,199
buckets if you don't know what it is yet

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,080
it's fine i didn't know either

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:22,880
so

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,400
who am i

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,080
my name is michal kamenski i'm a

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,679
computer science student at a tefnion

13
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,399
i'm working at a studio position at a

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,559
cyber intelligence

15
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,239
as a cyber intelligence

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,980
analyst

17
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,120
[Music]

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,640
so i would like to start this

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,360
presentation the same way i started my

20
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,800
job interview for the role

21
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,079
i don't know anything

22
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,039
i don't want to mislead anyone

23
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,000
i want to walk you through

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,680
my journey

25
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,640
so

26
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,879
when i say anything i really mean

27
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,160
anything

28
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,039
i

29
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,240
when i started with linux i tried to

30
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,080
type in my password

31
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,680
and couldn't figure out

32
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,799
why i wanted to get typed in

33
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,840
and nothing would show up on the screen

34
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,000
it took me quite a while to figure out

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,759
that's just the way it works in linux

36
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,600
so my purpose here today is to walk you

37
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,080
through my journey and

38
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,320
i will do that

39
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,640
by ex walking you through some case

40
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,200
studies from my work that will be more

41
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,320
technical

42
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,520
um

43
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,880
and

44
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,240
well that's it let's begin

45
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,280
so what's the bucket a bucket is a

46
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,920
database that is stored in the cloud

47
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,960
and

48
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,360
the problem is many companies just

49
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,200
misconfigure their buckets and leave

50
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,560
them completely open on like for anyone

51
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,920
to access them

52
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,680
with just a web browser

53
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,840
so that's what a bucket looks like in

54
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,119
the browser

55
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,520
just a list of files

56
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,200
this is a picture i took from

57
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,360
from an article i found on google

58
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,920
and you can see the credit just right

59
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,280
down

60
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,560
right below the picture

61
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,760
and

62
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,959
companies

63
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,120
many companies i was surprised to find

64
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,319
out

65
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,920
just leave a lot of sensitive

66
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,560
information a lot of

67
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,720
customer information their employees of

68
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,200
information just open for anybody

69
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,360
so the first case study i want to talk

70
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,360
about is

71
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,040
this airline

72
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,920
they

73
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,160
left their bucket open on the

74
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,560
on the web

75
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,879
and what did we find in there there were

76
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,680
many many terabytes of

77
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,519
files

78
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:00,220
for example

79
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,640
[Music]

80
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,760
there were there was source code with

81
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,920
passwords and keys

82
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,519
and i don't know a lot but i

83
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,200
don't think that you're supposed to put

84
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,500
your password inside your code

85
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,800
[Music]

86
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,519
here's a screenshot of course i redacted

87
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,120
the parts that

88
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,360
should be public that they did live

89
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,040
public

90
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,280
their aws keys

91
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,480
their

92
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,200
passwords api keys

93
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,839
trust everything

94
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,400
there were

95
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,480
airplane navigation

96
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,200
and

97
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,480
landing source code including equations

98
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,760
for

99
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,560
calculating landings of airplanes

100
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,239
that had writing permissions

101
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,120
just anyone could go and change the

102
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,439
source code for the

103
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,560
landing of an airplane

104
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,799
um there were

105
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:01,840
a

106
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,319
security procedures from various

107
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,080
airports around the world

108
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,239
and there was an alert system to send

109
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,400
the urgent messages and alerts for a

110
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,000
pilots while they're flying me there

111
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,798
and many more

112
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,320
okay so

113
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,000
there is all this source code

114
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,840
there are apk files there are java files

115
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,120
i've been told to find passwords keys

116
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,840
i

117
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,919
don't know how to do that i've been told

118
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,880
to look for secrets

119
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,840
i thought like the main stuff that

120
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,520
should be left secret

121
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,759
i they realized it was like a

122
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,919
professional term that meant passwords

123
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:44,960
and keys

124
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,280
uh after i realized that i knew better

125
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,880
how to google when i knew that

126
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,800
terminology i could know what i should

127
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,639
look for and what i should learn

128
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,800
so i found this open source tool there

129
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,639
are many open source tools for analyzing

130
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,759
information for finding anything you

131
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,280
want to do you

132
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,199
barely need to write anything new

133
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,039
yourself

134
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,160
in this

135
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,639
world of tools so there i use this uh

136
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,840
open source tool called apk leaks

137
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,360
and

138
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,960
it just reverses the code of the

139
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,479
apk files

140
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,800
and

141
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,919
and finds automatically passwords and

142
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,320
keys for example amazon

143
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,759
keys they all start with ikea and then

144
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,639
it's one way you can find the keys in

145
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,600
the

146
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,560
data

147
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,479
and

148
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,400
it just prints out everything you need

149
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,560
to find

150
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,440
so

151
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,160
this was a bucket that

152
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,160
was kind of different from other

153
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,639
brackets that i was working before

154
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,759
it just made me

155
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,039
realize

156
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,919
how bad the situation is with leaving um

157
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,479
just any information open

158
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,440
um why would anyone leave that open

159
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,639
um

160
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,280
and there are so many other buckets just

161
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,240
like that open out there you can you

162
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,600
just can't get

163
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,199
all of them

164
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,240
um

165
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,800
you don't necessarily need some brand

166
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,080
new zero day to attack or to

167
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,360
find a sensitive information you can

168
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,160
just by

169
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,840
misconfiguration of buckets or

170
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,520
other systems get a lot of information

171
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,479
and

172
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,120
i'm no expert but i think that's

173
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,639
something that could get abused by

174
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,120
terrorists and

175
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,280
it just it's good that it got closed

176
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,800
so the thing i like most about my job is

177
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,720
the attribution

178
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,639
um

179
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,599
it's to find who the owner of the bucket

180
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:06,960
is

181
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,360
it feels like a puzzle something you

182
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,479
need to

183
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,280
figure out you need to search for it you

184
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,319
need to

185
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,919
think creatively um so it can be

186
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,520
difficult but

187
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,880
it's the most interesting part

188
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,120
uh sometimes it's really obvious for

189
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,360
example if it says just besides tlv

190
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,039
in the bucket name

191
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,800
you can assume with a certain certainty

192
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,080
that it belongs to besides okay

193
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,159
but it's not always that simple

194
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,400
so i want to talk about a case study

195
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,879
that involved a bucket full of student

196
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,160
records student names their id numbers

197
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,240
and their

198
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,160
grades in various courses

199
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,479
so the bucket name include the word

200
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:01,919
israel

201
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,599
all the

202
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,080
newest files in the bucket were from the

203
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,000
same academic

204
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,840
institution in israel

205
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,639
and it was live it was still

206
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,440
there were still new files uploaded

207
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,319
every day and all of them were from this

208
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,240
same institution

209
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,879
academic institution in israel so it

210
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,280
seems pretty obvious right it pro it

211
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,759
probably belongs to this academic

212
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,280
institution

213
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,598
um

214
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,399
but not so fast

215
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,200
while i was going just sampling some

216
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,080
files to see what's in there

217
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,240
i encountered

218
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,040
an invoice

219
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,760
it was an invoice

220
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,640
from

221
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,519
a company a to company b

222
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,920
both of them were from a foreign country

223
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,560
none of them related any way to israel

224
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,160
none of them related to this academic

225
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,160
institution it was

226
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,040
weird

227
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,600
like why would it be in the bucket

228
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,680
um

229
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,040
so

230
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,399
i

231
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,360
sent this

232
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,399
invoice

233
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,440
to my

234
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,360
team leaders i

235
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,279
they told me just it's the bucket of

236
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,680
this academic institution you need to go

237
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,880
over it quickly and we will

238
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,720
send it for remediation so it will get

239
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,760
close as soon as possible

240
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,040
[Music]

241
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,120
but i sent it to them and i was like

242
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,800
wait a second how do you know it belongs

243
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,880
to this academic institution

244
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,640
how why

245
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,640
don't you think it might be something

246
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,880
else for example this i found this

247
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,839
invoice

248
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,720
why would it why would it be there

249
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,760
um

250
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,880
but again

251
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,839
i'm a newbie i don't know

252
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,680
anything who am i to challenge them

253
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,320
um am i just being stubborn

254
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,240
they have a lot of experience if they

255
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,680
saying no

256
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,440
whatever leave it

257
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,560
should i just leave it or should i

258
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,440
like keep going or investigating it or

259
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,600
whatever

260
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,560
but

261
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,040
so i said okay they know better

262
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:13,760
but

263
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,240
my brain is still itchy so just for

264
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,959
myself i will go over i will understand

265
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,160
why they believe it's it belongs to this

266
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,920
academic institution

267
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,360
i will just ease my mind

268
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,839
so i started going over the files there

269
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,640
are millions of files you can go over

270
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,399
all of them even if you wanted to and of

271
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,240
course i didn't want to do that's not

272
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,000
not ethical

273
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,160
so what can i do

274
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,120
i looked at the files i tried to

275
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,360
see if there was something that stood

276
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,720
out

277
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,279
and first of all i looked at the dates i

278
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,279
saw that all the old ones

279
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,800
belongs to academic institutions from

280
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,040
a foreign country and all the new ones

281
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,720
belong to this academic institution here

282
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,440
in israel and i managed to find the

283
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,079
exact date when the switch happened

284
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,480
second i

285
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,040
kept looking for things that would stand

286
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,959
out i don't want to just go over

287
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,120
millions of student records it's not

288
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,880
interesting i want to find some proof

289
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,200
who this bucket belongs to

290
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,600
i don't want to report to some random

291
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,519
academic institution about this open

292
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,040
bucket if it's not their bucket

293
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,720
so

294
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,640
i noticed that the invoice that i found

295
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,760
had a slightly different name scheme

296
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,279
than all the other files

297
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,920
they all were just random strings

298
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,079
but there was something different about

299
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,639
the snap scheme so i looked at other

300
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:57,360
files who had the same name scheme and

301
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,920
most of them were just

302
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,839
a bunch of

303
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,639
stock photos it didn't help me much

304
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:05,519
but

305
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,480
um then some of them

306
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,760
were screenshots that had some

307
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,880
uh

308
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,480
it was some documents of a company that

309
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,560
was verifying student records

310
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,839
so i googled then i have this company i

311
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,639
found two websites the first one

312
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,399
was a global website

313
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,800
it was of this foreign country

314
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,440
that um

315
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,600
that this company verifies student

316
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,600
records in this country and the second

317
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,519
one was

318
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,120
um

319
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,839
it was the ending of coil

320
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,399
and this

321
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,040
this website was verifying customer

322
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,760
records for this academic institution in

323
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,240
israel

324
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,880
so i just was telling you the road that

325
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,480
finally worked

326
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,079
but

327
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,639
it wasn't that easy it took a lot of

328
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,920
trial and error so

329
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,320
i i just found myself at 3am in the

330
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,639
morning screaming my computer being part

331
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,560
i was really proud of myself

332
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,839
that

333
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,800
i found something that

334
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,800
much more experienced

335
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,959
people my team leaders

336
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,200
didn't find i didn't i wasn't proud of

337
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,320
myself because of the technical steps

338
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,920
none of them were

339
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,279
more than basic

340
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,519
i was proud of myself that i wasn't

341
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,639
scared to research on my own that i

342
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,480
didn't just say then probably know

343
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,480
better i should just listen to them and

344
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,000
leave it and leave this alone

345
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,959
and of course i was i didn't have

346
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,560
anything to be scared of

347
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,720
they were happy i did that they were

348
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,839
part of me

349
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,120
and

350
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,880
that's something i think is very

351
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,959
important for a company that employs

352
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,040
juniors um to have this kind of

353
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,839
atmosphere

354
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,519
okay a few other stuff that i found

355
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,760
really cool at my job during this few

356
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,519
months i'm working there

357
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,760
is that a lot of the boring stuff can be

358
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,959
automated

359
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,920
the research most of the time can't be

360
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,800
or

361
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,399
at least not in a really simple way but

362
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,600
other stuff

363
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,360
can be

364
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,199
i got really excited about regular

365
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,800
expressions

366
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,199
they were mind-blowing

367
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,079
first in a bad way because they were a

368
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,680
little

369
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,440
annoying but

370
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,639
while

371
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,440
when i got the hang of it it was really

372
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,959
cool that you can just with a few rules

373
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,959
and get exactly

374
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,920
the data you want exactly what you're

375
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,560
looking for

376
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,800
other cool stuff i found is that without

377
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,639
any tools anything special just

378
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:01,839
with using

379
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,480
source code you can find open buckets on

380
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,680
websites

381
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,560
you can see in the network tab in the

382
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,360
dev tools what a sources they are

383
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,720
calling to retrieve images

384
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,040
you can use that to see

385
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,320
where are they calling them from and

386
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,040
sometimes those buckets are open

387
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,000
also

388
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,240
most companies are not very creative

389
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,199
with their names of their buckets most

390
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,920
of the times just companies name

391
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,320
production or fraud

392
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,800
and if you find one there are probably

393
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,920
other ones no one just misconfigures

394
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,639
just this bucket but by mistake if you

395
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,279
know how to configure it you do it

396
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,839
so if you find prod

397
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,800
you follow you probably will find

398
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,560
non-prod

399
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,839
and stuff like that

400
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,040
so i started there i didn't know how to

401
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,639
type a password into the linux terminal

402
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,279
um and after two months

403
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,440
i got to where i'm here

404
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,839
right now

405
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,160
it to this case studies they were just

406
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,959
two months after i started my job

407
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,359
um

408
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,720
i wanted

409
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,880
a

410
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,959
i want to conclude this

411
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:23,920
first

412
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,880
um by my experience

413
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,120
that you can learn a lot when you're

414
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,560
just a beginner

415
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,079
everything is new to you everything is

416
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,160
interesting you can just learn really

417
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,199
fast

418
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,440
also the company culture is really

419
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,320
important to make the juniors feel that

420
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,639
they can contribute that they will be

421
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,680
heard that they can just

422
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,519
um

423
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:50,959
they can

424
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,440
speak their mind and that everything

425
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,600
that they won't be dismissed

426
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,320
um also it's important to make friends

427
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,800
that are at the same stage as you are

428
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,839
that

429
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,920
maybe were at the same stage that you

430
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,959
are

431
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,230
just a year ago or two

432
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,799
[Music]

433
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,919
to not take this journey alone

434
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,359
um

435
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,319
and there are no shortcuts just learn

436
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,359
your own and keep trying

437
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,280
and about the technical stuff

438
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,160
you i just the main thing i learned

439
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,160
there are all this cool stuff all these

440
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,200
vulnerabilities zero days

441
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,799
but at the end

442
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:31,520
the

443
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,160
main vulnerabilities are just stuff that

444
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,480
gets misconfigured

445
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,080
and

446
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,000
you can find a lot of

447
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,720
sensitive data this way

448
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,120
and that's it

449
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,760
so i want to thank besides i wasn't

450
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,760
playing and talking here actually

451
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,559
my friends pressured me to talk here

452
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,880
but i'm glad i did and somehow i got

453
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,130
accepted
