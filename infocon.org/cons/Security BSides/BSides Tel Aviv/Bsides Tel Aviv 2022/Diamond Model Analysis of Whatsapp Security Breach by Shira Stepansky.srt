00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,220
[Music]

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:03,740
[Applause]

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:09,880
[Music]

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,360
[Applause]

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,320
okay

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,200
um

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,639
they told me my notes would be in front

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,560
of me they're no longer in front of me

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,680
um

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,039
i just want to

11
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,039
tell you that i'm speaking here today

12
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,039
because i was at my first besides in

13
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,199
2017 and i'm

14
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,960
giving back to the community because i

15
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,119
love a community that shares what it

16
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,519
learns and teaches each other and so i

17
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,200
want you all to be here

18
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,120
hopefully sooner than five years from

19
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,599
now speaking yourselves so um

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,120
wait that was supposed to be

21
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,039
that

22
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,680
see if we can get it to work okay um

23
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,840
okay so my talk

24
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,440
my talking i'm really glad it followed

25
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,040
on the one before because the one report

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,880
is a huge amount of information

27
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,960
and i think

28
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,960
one of the challenges in cyber security

29
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,799
and analysis

30
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,360
is the fact that there is just so much

31
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,840
information and we're all

32
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,680
fishing in the same sea

33
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,880
but we're all looking for something

34
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,840
different

35
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,600
in other words a person who's working

36
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,920
for a cyber security company is looking

37
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,320
in that information for one thing and

38
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,720
this person who owns a regular company

39
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,720
and needs to defend their company from

40
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,880
malware like you just saw

41
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,720
needs different information

42
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,840
and

43
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,119
they're all looking in the same and

44
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,360
people who are working on cyber policy

45
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,680
for governments are looking

46
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,119
for other information but we're all

47
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,880
looking at the same data so the question

48
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,680
is

49
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,320
how do you take that massive amount of

50
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,960
information and make it accessible for

51
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,560
all these different uses

52
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,720
so

53
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,560
so as

54
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,640
there are a number of different models

55
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,479
there's this is only a chart of only

56
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,719
three of them of which i'm speaking

57
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,360
about the diamond model

58
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,878
and

59
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,440
which was actually developed by three

60
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,160
researchers i believe in 2013

61
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,599
and

62
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,400
their intro discussion of their model

63
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,640
was over 45 minutes but don't worry my

64
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,319
talk is 20 minutes in total so you're

65
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,599
getting the cliff notes version

66
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,959
come back here

67
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,959
okay

68
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,799
okay i guess these are out order um

69
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,720
so the diamond model basically uses a

70
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,319
diamond and what it uses is it uses two

71
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,160
there's two at least two levels to it

72
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,040
the first level is each corner is one of

73
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,040
the four major

74
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,480
pieces of data that you're looking for

75
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,480
when you have a breach and the breach

76
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,720
and though that data is who got hit who

77
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,840
got hurt who did the

78
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,239
hurting capabilities is how they did it

79
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,040
and the infrastructure is by what means

80
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,480
did they do it

81
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,440
actually okay the capability is um

82
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,480
what

83
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,000
what what you have to defend from or

84
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,959
what the what the attacker has to to use

85
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,080
to

86
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,000
to to attack with like the malware for

87
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,840
example

88
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,440
uh i think we just skipped again

89
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,400
okay so what once you have the

90
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,519
information first of all one of the

91
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,360
things that the diamond model

92
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,480
shows you

93
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,080
even though it looks very simple what it

94
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,000
is it's a place to hang all that

95
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
information it's a way to organize it

96
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
and show you what what what information

97
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,080
do you have and what information are you

98
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,360
still missing what do you need to look

99
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,680
for once you have that information then

100
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,120
you can start working with the lockheed

101
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,159
kill chain

102
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,720
and start figuring out what's going on

103
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,400
what happened what really happened and

104
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,159
what you need to do to keep it from

105
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,959
happening next time

106
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,000
so although it started with one simple

107
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
diamond each diamond represents an

108
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,560
individual event so what you have here

109
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,560
is now that you've figured out what they

110
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,840
did

111
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,159
how they did it

112
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,760
how they're going to possibly use it

113
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,399
again you can now then look and plan and

114
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,759
think

115
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,040
how can we defend against this

116
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,680
so now that you know

117
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,360
that you're at least looking for in a

118
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,479
forest

119
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:27,440
or where

120
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,880
the question is now what do you do with

121
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,040
it

122
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,000
okay i've got

123
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,000
okay so this is an intro one minute

124
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,520
introduction to the actual breach that

125
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,120
i'm going to show how you use the

126
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,800
diamond model for

127
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,120
assuming i can get it to play

128
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,160
thanks

129
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,400
okay so you don't get the video so um

130
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,160
the one thing that i missed on the

131
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,080
diamond is there's the second level of

132
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,840
the diamond is

133
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,479
actually the axis you know the vertical

134
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,600
axis is the victim and the

135
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,199
the attacker

136
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,240
and the question is what's their

137
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,000
relationship no it was were they

138
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
attacked for a specific reason or was it

139
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,560
a random attack and then obvious the

140
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,520
second axis from right to left is

141
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,960
um

142
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,639
your technology you know all the

143
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,800
technology that was being used so

144
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,880
the

145
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,440
the what's up

146
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,759
um

147
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,479
the weather breach occurred in 2019

148
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,320
and you'll be happy to know that it was

149
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,280
very quickly fixed but what it was was

150
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,400
um

151
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,199
the ability for an attacker

152
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,639
to

153
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,080
um

154
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,120
to send an sms to a what's up

155
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,960
or actually they called

156
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,039
they called a number on the west what's

157
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,520
on a what's up on the what's up app and

158
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,240
even if the receive recipient didn't

159
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,440
answer

160
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,360
it still install the malware on their

161
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,440
software i mean on their

162
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,600
cell phone and it was used to track and

163
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,800
harass uh a number of people and

164
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,680
allegedly one person was killed by

165
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,639
um

166
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,199
a government agency from saudi arabia as

167
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,840
a result of being attacked through this

168
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,159
breach

169
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,919
okay so

170
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:26,880
um

171
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,759
so again so this

172
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,880
basically the reason i wanted to

173
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,720
the victims were clearly the

174
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,560
clients that

175
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,560
were that bought a software called

176
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,800
pegasus from a company called nso which

177
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,479
happens to be an israeli company i

178
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,479
believe i'm pretty sure it still exists

179
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,199
and it sells software to it exports

180
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,240
software to companies that it claims

181
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,479
are vetted and approved by the israeli

182
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:57,440
government

183
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,639
um

184
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,160
the what's up app

185
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,000
made it very clear that there are a

186
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,680
number of these

187
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,720
clients

188
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,360
and um in particular saudi arabia was

189
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,680
the first one identified but since then

190
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,680
china and india have been implicated as

191
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,800
well

192
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,759
and

193
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,080
so the victim of this particular breach

194
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,520
was all the people that these

195
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,280
governments want to target

196
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,680
and obviously

197
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,479
when what's up filed in u.s court

198
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,199
against nso they listed themselves as

199
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,639
the victim but they weren't really the

200
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,199
victim the victim was their users who

201
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,520
were attacked and harassed and

202
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,919
eventually some of them killed

203
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,759
so the question with the capabilities

204
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,039
was what's the

205
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,680
was pegasus software which is actually a

206
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,720
group of

207
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,400
pieces of malware not just one

208
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,680
particular item

209
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,479
and

210
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,879
it was obviously deployed through the

211
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,120
what's up mobile infrastructure and it

212
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,479
worked on

213
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,080
on all of them it worked on it works on

214
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,840
android it works on iphone and it worked

215
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,840
on back then people still using

216
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,919
blackberries

217
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,960
okay so we discussed the victim so

218
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,639
um

219
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,479
no

220
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:07,360
and

221
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,360
we discussed adversary

222
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,879
so

223
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,560
the capabilities i also mentioned was

224
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,919
pegasus okay we got through that and

225
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,680
the infrastructure was as we said um

226
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,280
your mobile phone

227
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,560
and your mobile phone provider

228
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,440
um

229
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,479
okay so

230
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,160
now what do you do with all the

231
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,919
information okay as we saw in the

232
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,919
previous oh we've probably seen all day

233
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,479
there's just so much information what do

234
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,240
you do with it

235
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,320
so it depends on who you are and what

236
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,760
you need it for

237
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,240
so it can be used for political

238
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,640
making making government policies it can

239
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,360
be used for figuring out how to defend

240
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,279
yourself it can be used for

241
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,519
figuring out how to attack if that's

242
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,640
what you do

243
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,399
um

244
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,519
and so what i chose to was this cyber

245
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,000
policy

246
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,519
i chose cyber policy because i'm a dual

247
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,800
us citizen

248
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,440
i was served in the us army in

249
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,519
maintenance and worked for the faa

250
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,120
critical infrastructure and i now live

251
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,760
here so for me i was very interested in

252
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,320
the political implications of such a

253
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,760
mult multinational attack and

254
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,680
as you can see the

255
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,920
several of those major questions are who

256
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,399
gets to decide who gets to buy this

257
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,800
um and obviously people in the us

258
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,839
weren't too happy

259
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,320
um and

260
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,959
the question is

261
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,079
who can export to where

262
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,399
so i don't know why this this should

263
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,839
have been

264
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,120
one of the other things you can do is

265
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,880
you can take as i discussed when i

266
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,200
showed you the the diagrams

267
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,200
but this is the lockheed kill chain

268
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,760
using the same information

269
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,920
[Music]

270
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,279
and one of the reasons this is very

271
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,360
helpful is because

272
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,040
as you can see

273
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,640
you can really it's really obvious what

274
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,680
information you have and what

275
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,479
information you're missing

276
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,240
and the kill the kill chain basically

277
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,399
tells you the point of no return at what

278
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:17,519
point

279
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,200
in your analysis and at what point of

280
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,720
attack or a breach

281
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,640
can you still defend and at what point

282
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,880
is it too late

283
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,279
yeah this

284
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,399
this point this all sounds very simple

285
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,240
but when you've got massive amounts of

286
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,079
information the question is how do you

287
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,519
organize it and that's what the diamond

288
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,079
model was designed to do was to organize

289
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,600
this and

290
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,839
once only once you have your analysis do

291
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,839
you know what you're really looking

292
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,000
at is not really

293
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,920
so

294
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,640
the political social analysis is is

295
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,640
actually is usually done on three levels

296
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,160
on the organization level on the state

297
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,160
national multinational level

298
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,880
and the level of transnational which

299
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,800
most people would probably refer to is

300
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,439
international

301
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,040
so on the national

302
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,640
national on

303
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,399
the organizational level

304
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,920
obviously we have a number of israeli

305
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,600
companies who produce

306
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,480
cyber

307
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,680
defense

308
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,519
software

309
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,720
i

310
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,839
don't need to say anything that there

311
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,480
are a number of places in the world that

312
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,720
create malware

313
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,959
and

314
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,800
the offices of both those companies many

315
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,920
times have direct

316
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,399
contact not through government agencies

317
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,079
not necessarily asking governments for

318
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,000
permission but they have direct contact

319
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,920
and direct relations to sell their

320
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,519
software to whoever they feel like

321
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,519
the question is should that be the case

322
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,480
should that not be the case

323
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,079
okay on the national level every country

324
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,560
has obviously different laws so the

325
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,079
question is what's good for one country

326
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,839
may not be good for another country the

327
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:00,720
us

328
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,959
is not very happy with people

329
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,360
spying on their citizens

330
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,880
on the other hand they

331
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,959
have been caught doing it several times

332
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,120
um right now in germany there are new

333
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,000
laws authorized authorizing

334
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,440
major major surveillance of their people

335
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,959
and uh

336
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,880
and the ua the eu in general has

337
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,839
increased

338
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,760
their privacy and other cyber security

339
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,360
requirements

340
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,160
for

341
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,399
people who are operating legally the

342
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,800
question is what about people who may

343
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,040
not be

344
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,399
so with regards to making policy these

345
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,279
are the big questions

346
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,800
if you're selling

347
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,240
if you're selling something that hurting

348
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,920
people do you have the right to do that

349
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,519
if so who has the right to do that and

350
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,560
who decides who gets that right

351
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,720
and

352
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,560
according to nso they changed their

353
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,600
policies but they're still selling the

354
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,120
question is who's deciding what and

355
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,839
where and ensuring

356
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,240
transparency of the

357
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,880
actual tools that are being used

358
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,839
well we all have the internet we've all

359
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,600
we probably all use the internet to

360
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,839
research most of what we do

361
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,760
in terms of finding out what was out

362
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,240
there but

363
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,639
how transparent is what's really there

364
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,000
and how transparent should it be

365
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,399
and then of course with a particular

366
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,000
what's up applica um breach what happens

367
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,240
to people's human rights and what

368
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,959
happens going forward

369
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,120
so my takeaway for this was

370
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,760
basically when i started

371
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,600
you we're all fishing in the same sea

372
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,959
we're all using the same data the

373
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,519
question is what are we using it for and

374
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,199
how do we make use of it and the diamond

375
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,680
model is one particular

376
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,920
very useful tool for showing us what we

377
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,480
have what we don't have and then being

378
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,320
able to build on that to build into the

379
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,560
into the lockheed model and the kill

380
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,760
chain and

381
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,360
and be able to create

382
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,000
software and policy that

383
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,279
helps us

384
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,560
deal with the problems that we have

385
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,199
today with the internet and other

386
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,199
malware issues

387
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,240
so thank you

388
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,610
[Applause]

389
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,560
[Music]

390
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,518
any questions

391
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:44,399
okay

392
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,880
thank you very much questions anyone

393
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,240
you you mentioned like who is the

394
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,160
authority you mentioned with the

395
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,839
authority

396
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,800
to

397
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,079
again who is the authority to

398
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,880
allow those companies like nso

399
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,959
to sell and

400
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,800
i'm not from nso

401
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,680
but

402
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,519
i know that they were

403
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,199
they had to get a permit from the

404
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,120
government to sell

405
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,519
to government uh

406
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,920
agencies of certain

407
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,519
countries who are on the white list okay

408
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,600
not to the

409
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,040
to those the end

410
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,680
and the question is actually

411
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,040
who

412
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,120
gives the authority

413
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,399
to sell

414
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,160
weapon

415
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,240
not cyber weapon

416
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,279
to

417
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,120
all the countries

418
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,399
and the us is the largest uh

419
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,040
exporter and us as well and we sell to

420
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,839
whoever pays

421
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,240
right so an excellent question the

422
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,600
question is who actually makes this

423
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,480
decision

424
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,519
and

425
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,519
it's not always clear

426
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:58,880
and that was on one of the slides that

427
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,199
didn't really show up well and that's

428
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,720
exactly why i was interested in the

429
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,600
cyber policy issue of the breach because

430
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,079
the reach is pretty cut and dry what

431
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,320
happened the question is now what do we

432
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,000
do at now that we've seen this happen

433
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
and that is the giant question is who

434
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,839
decides whether nso

435
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,120
can sell it

436
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,040
or export it in the first place and who

437
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,560
decides um

438
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,800
to whom they can sell it and

439
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,279
that is an off an office in the israeli

440
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,800
government which i'm

441
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,600
not necessarily in a position to state i

442
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,720
don't know

443
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,639
i can find out free i can that's one of

444
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:33,759
the things i'm actually researching to

445
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,680
find out who

446
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,880
it's part of that's part of the whole

447
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,120
social political issue and and that's

448
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,959
one of the things that

449
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,040
that makes this this whole analysis very

450
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,519
interesting because it's not cut and dry

451
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,120
yeah the technical part's cut and dry

452
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,240
what happened

453
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,240
and maybe who got hurt but the

454
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,720
implications are far from cut and dry

455
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,399
and that's what made this

456
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:55,920
analysis project very interesting to

457
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,600
research and i'm still working on and

458
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,959
yes i would if you'll give me your

459
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,199
information afterwards if i find out who

460
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,199
in the israeli government if it's public

461
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,280
information

462
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,959
i'm sure it is yeah but i just have to

463
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,959
look it up um

464
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,559
and also and also the same thing with

465
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,480
the u.s the question is okay let's say

466
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,119
the nso got approval to sell it

467
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,039
and they

468
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,439
sold it to saudi arabia well back in

469
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,280
2019 2000

470
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,439
maybe saudi arabia was not such a friend

471
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,640
of the us so can he should can and or

472
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,360
should the us be able to say no you

473
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,960
can't sell it even though the israeli

474
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,880
government says yes you can

475
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,320
and that's where the transnational

476
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,679
issues come in and that's what makes

477
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:36,799
this whole thing

478
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:37,679
very

479
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,280
i want you to have you could say not you

480
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,880
know nothing meaning n-o-t-t-y meaning

481
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,840
k-k-n-o-t-t-y meaning

482
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,960
forney meaning complicated

483
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,840
or

484
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,440
or you want to just take the what we

485
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,440
call here the rosh catan which is the

486
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,280
the small mind meaning just do the

487
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,480
simple thing and that never works

488
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,360
it's

489
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,039
right it's far beyond it and it's very

490
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,880
complicated and that's what makes this

491
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,480
kind of analysis very interesting

492
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,000
because the answer you come up with the

493
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,360
answer i come up it may not be the same

494
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,240
thing

495
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,919
and the answer to the nso came up was

496
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,280
obviously it was not the same thing

497
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,799
okay next question

498
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,320
anyone else any more questions

499
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,410
okay shira thank you very much

500
