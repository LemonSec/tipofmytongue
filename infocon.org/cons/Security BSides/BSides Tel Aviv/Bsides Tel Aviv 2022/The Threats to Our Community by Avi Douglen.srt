00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,220
[Music]

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:03,740
[Applause]

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:09,880
[Music]

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,280
[Applause]

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,360
so while i sort this out i'll uh get

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,280
started because i'm really really

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,119
excited to be here and it's not just

8
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:18,640
because it's less crowded on the side of

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,320
the stage

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,720
is a really special talk for me it's not

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,119
a standard security talk it is a

12
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,519
security talk but it's not about

13
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:28,880
security

14
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,800
it's about the security community

15
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,519
still no screens

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,040
and i think the security community

17
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,040
compared to other communities is

18
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,879
uniquely positioned

19
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,440
to apply our security skills

20
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,120
to the very fabric of our community

21
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,160
itself

22
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,039
to build a more secure community

23
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,480
and we're going to talk about that as

24
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,480
soon as we could talk about threat

25
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,559
modeling well who here is familiar with

26
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,680
threat modeling quick show of hands

27
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,960
who's heard of threat modeling other

28
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,320
than just now there's a good show of

29
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,879
hands that's pretty good not everybody

30
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,799
threat modeling is basically

31
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,280
a way it's a structured framework to

32
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,600
think about security of your system to

33
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,799
do a structured security analysis of a

34
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,119
complex system

35
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,240
there's a lot of different approaches a

36
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,640
lot of different ways the uh going back

37
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,159
to some of the old folks in the room

38
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,240
might remember a famous paper from 1999

39
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,640
by lauren and prairie

40
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,560
working at microsoft put together a

41
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,560
paper called the threats to our products

42
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,840
and they basically laid out this

43
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,600
structured framework of how to do threat

44
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,439
modeling and they introduced something

45
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,079
called stride which we're going to use

46
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,439
without this good to go yay

47
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,439
all right so that's threat modeling who

48
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,240
here thinks community is important

49
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,280
come on a little bit more than that

50
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,720
we're at b-sides who thinks committee is

51
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,200
important yes

52
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,200
community doesn't just happen people

53
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,280
work hard at it

54
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,799
round of applause for everybody working

55
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,520
on b-sides

56
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,240
they work hard at it but i want

57
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,160
i want to take these techniques of

58
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,520
threat modeling

59
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,280
of security analysis which is one of the

60
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,840
best ways to analyze a complex system

61
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,520
and apply this to one of the most

62
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,120
complex systems i know which is a

63
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,080
community and apply this to build a more

64
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,160
secure community that's exactly what we

65
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,920
want to do quick introduction to myself

66
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,280
actually omar pretty much said

67
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,879
everything my name is avi duglan you can

68
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,280
find my internet face bouncing around

69
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,480
contact details if you want to reach out

70
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,640
to me my pronouns my day job i do

71
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,640
security consulting at a small boutique

72
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,560
called bounce security

73
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,239
but i am more active in several

74
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,000
different communities as omar said i'm

75
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,840
one of the leaders of the oasp israel

76
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,239
chapter i'm on the global board of

77
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,000
directors of owasp if you have any

78
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,680
complaints about oauth feel free to send

79
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,120
them my way i probably won't be able to

80
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,720
do much about it but feel free to

81
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,840
complain

82
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,760
that's what we do best i'm also a

83
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,239
community moderator on the security

84
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,319
stack exchange site it's the stack

85
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,480
overflow site for security fantastic

86
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,040
resource with a large community global

87
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,640
community that actually built up around

88
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,480
this site as well

89
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,159
so i have quite a bit of experience with

90
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,159
different kinds of online communities

91
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,080
i'm also one of the co-authors of the

92
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,480
threat modeling manifesto which is a

93
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,560
great way to get started with threat

94
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,440
modeling or to upgrade your existing

95
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,760
practice to something even better you're

96
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,920
gonna go to

97
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,400
threatmodelingmanifesto.org if you have

98
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,239
seven minutes you could read through it

99
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,159
twice

100
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,480
and it's really interesting to to see

101
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,879
how to scale up better and whatever

102
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,480
approach you take to threat modeling but

103
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,480
what is threat modeling right this isn't

104
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,840
going to freely borrow from the

105
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,000
manifesto i feel comfortable doing that

106
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,440
since i was one of the authors this

107
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,799
little statement took us about three

108
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,959
weeks to put together 15 people but what

109
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,319
is threat modeling threat modeling is

110
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,959
about analyzing representations of a

111
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,599
system to highlight concerns about

112
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,000
security and privacy characteristics the

113
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,760
emphasis here is mine i have my own

114
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,519
definition that i usually share with

115
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,280
developer teams but this serves our

116
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,040
purpose well here because it's about

117
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,280
security it's about privacy right

118
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,720
there's a lot of different things and

119
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,319
it's about concerns

120
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,400
we didn't say threats it's not a long

121
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,599
list of bugs long list of

122
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,920
vulnerabilities concerns things that we

123
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,120
want to take care of things that we want

124
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,040
to consider about how to fix how to make

125
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,238
better

126
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:17,839
and we do this not by testing the live

127
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,560
system but representations we take an

128
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,720
abstraction of a system this might be a

129
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,639
diagram it might be the design of a

130
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,919
system it might be some other

131
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,280
description of it

132
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,759
abstractions

133
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,600
for those of you that not familiar with

134
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,520
this diagram it's a classic picture of a

135
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,919
world war ii bomber obviously the

136
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,840
bombing effort was big deal for in world

137
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,840
war ii for the allies a huge amount of

138
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,759
aircraft fire losing a lot of planes i

139
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,000
think 25 of the planes didn't come back

140
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,919
and the allies said you know what let's

141
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,520
collect some data

142
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,520
about the where the planes are getting

143
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,199
shot every plane that came back they

144
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,160
marked down where the planes were

145
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,080
getting shot and there's a good map of

146
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,280
where the planes get shot i'm gonna put

147
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,600
more armor wherever the planes get shot

148
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,199
survive better it's a lot cheaper and

149
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,880
makes more sense than flying an entire

150
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,759
tank for sure

151
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,440
but right before they did that they

152
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,440
realized they fell into a very common

153
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,320
trap called survivor's bias they were

154
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,600
only looking at the planes that came

155
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,960
back

156
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,120
so this is actually a really good map of

157
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,280
where you don't need to put armor on the

158
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,360
planes because all these places are a

159
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,880
place where the plane will get shot and

160
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,560
still come back

161
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,000
we're a lot more concerned about the

162
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,919
planes that don't make it back

163
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,919
so they need to put armor everywhere

164
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,759
that you don't see bullet holes because

165
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,680
if the plane got shot in the cockpit

166
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,360
it's not coming back

167
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,800
that's where they need to put armor in

168
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,320
the same way we don't need to care about

169
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,600
every possible attack we don't care

170
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,199
about people not trying to attack our

171
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,160
system

172
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,360
we care about the attacks that get

173
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,280
through we care about the attacks that

174
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,720
actually impact

175
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,240
whatever value we have in our system

176
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,199
whatever

177
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,360
data we have whatever records we have

178
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,039
we need to think about how these attacks

179
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,840
work and how these threats affect our

180
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,239
system

181
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,520
so why do we want to be doing threat

182
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,720
modeling it makes you a lot more

183
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,160
efficient whatever you're doing if

184
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,080
you're building a simple

185
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,319
web form application deep technology

186
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,720
machine learning bug bounties pen tests

187
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,479
whatever you're doing

188
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,080
threat modeling it the system you're

189
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,000
working on will help you be a lot more

190
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,400
efficient it'll help you focus on the

191
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,080
parts of the security that actually

192
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,240
matter the ones that will give you the

193
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,039
most value it'll help you make more

194
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,440
informed decisions over time

195
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,520
and there's this concept of the shared

196
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,000
understanding of what security actually

197
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,039
means

198
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,039
for our system

199
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,639
everybody familiar with the parable of

200
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,720
four blind folks describing this great

201
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,000
big thing that they found in the room

202
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,600
and one of them says there's this big

203
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,520
pillar i can't move it the other one

204
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,960
says i keep bumping my head on this

205
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,440
leathery surface over here and another

206
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,880
one is complaining that there's this

207
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,800
feather keeps slapping her in the face

208
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,240
and another one says this hoes just

209
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,160
stole my hat and they don't realize

210
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,199
they're all talking about the same

211
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,960
elephant

212
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,400
very often with teams we'll see that in

213
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,240
the same way everybody has a different

214
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,199
idea

215
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,280
of how the system works of what security

216
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,720
actually means to us

217
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,240
threat modeling gets us reading on the

218
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,160
same page in the same direction and

219
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,880
understanding and agreeing what security

220
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,360
actually means to us in our context

221
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,160
i'm going to pull one best practice out

222
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,840
of the manifesto there's a bunch of

223
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,280
others but this one i really like in our

224
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,479
context

225
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,400
to really have an impactful threat

226
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,240
modeling practice you need to have a

227
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,199
culture of finding and fixing issues

228
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,720
it's not just enough to say okay we're

229
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,840
gonna go look at these things but you

230
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,560
have to have a culture built up around

231
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,199
of actually fixing the issues and the

232
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,319
problems that you find

233
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,039
and there's a lot of different

234
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,400
methodologies a lot of different

235
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,759
approaches whatever you take whatever

236
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,680
you decide to use you're going to need

237
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,759
to answer these four questions sometimes

238
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,080
we call this adam showstax framework

239
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,000
adam shellstack is practically the

240
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,680
godfather of modern threat modeling

241
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,840
literally wrote the book on it uh

242
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,759
years ago when he was at microsoft and

243
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,360
as a co-author of the manifesto we

244
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,120
actually adopted this into the manifesto

245
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,280
as well because threat modeling is about

246
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,800
answering these four questions number

247
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,800
one what are we working on what are we

248
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,879
building is it the system

249
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,759
is it this diagram is it is that feature

250
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,840
or that kind of security what is the

251
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,919
system that we are working on number two

252
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,800
what can go wrong these are the threats

253
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,720
the concerns the assumptions we might

254
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,280
have about the system

255
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,879
number three what are we going to do

256
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:21,840
about it

257
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,919
it's not just about generating a long

258
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,319
list of vulnerabilities it's about

259
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,479
actually making a more secure product a

260
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,080
more secure system

261
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,919
and like any process we need to ask

262
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,240
ourselves did we do a good job it makes

263
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,519
sense

264
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,159
and we might analyze a system it's a

265
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,679
online system we might use something

266
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,479
like a data flow diagram a dfd and you

267
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,240
got your processes and your data stores

268
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,320
and your data flows going everywhere and

269
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,000
it gives you a really good view of how

270
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,839
the system works the different

271
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,640
components the interfaces between them

272
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,920
and how everything could the

273
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,760
architecture how things work and what

274
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,760
crosses crust boundaries and we can

275
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,240
analyze this diagram in a really

276
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,399
effective manner

277
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,640
another approach excuse me another

278
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,279
approach to analyzing system is based on

279
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,120
the value chain what i like to call the

280
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,959
value-driven approach

281
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,440
and this is focusing less on the

282
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,240
vulnerabilities but more on the value

283
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,440
right number one why are we working on

284
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,519
this what is so important here about

285
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,440
this system what value do we get out of

286
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,279
it again if you're building a feature

287
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,200
are we doing this usually it's to follow

288
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,600
the money sell more product maybe it's

289
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,000
to get more eyeballs on my cat blog

290
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,519
maybe it's a literal chain with a

291
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,640
diamond hanging on that you're going to

292
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,880
steal at the end of the movie right

293
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,240
whatever it is you want to understand

294
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,480
what the value is what you're after and

295
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,920
then we could ask ourselves well how do

296
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,000
we get there from here how does this

297
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,680
that we're working on actually produce

298
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,120
that value

299
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,839
as a direct value

300
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,440
chain and then we can just go ahead and

301
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,959
say well how do we protect that value

302
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,080
chain how do we make sure that that

303
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,440
actually happens

304
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,560
right

305
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,360
now when we're trying to find the issues

306
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,000
the what can go wrong the threats a

307
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,760
common framework for this is known as

308
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,720
stride introduced in that 1999 paper

309
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,600
stride is a mnemonic it stands for

310
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,720
spoofing tampering remediation

311
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,000
information disclosure valve service

312
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,839
elevation of privileges

313
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,680
good repeat that in a second

314
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,120
but it's important to realize that this

315
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,160
is you know six different categories of

316
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,320
types of attacks that an attacker might

317
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,399
be looking for what their goals

318
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,240
are to do in your system what are they

319
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,920
looking to do

320
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,640
but it's not a classification scheme

321
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,399
it's all about

322
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,720
structured brainstorming to help you

323
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,959
focus on asking the right questions to

324
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,600
understand what it is you're looking for

325
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,200
and you could ask tons of questions tons

326
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,720
of questions kind of kind of like you're

327
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,160
a five-year-old tons of questions to

328
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,120
find what would happen if what would

329
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,200
happen if what can i do within finding

330
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,000
and finding additional very specific

331
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,160
attack scenarios for each one of these

332
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,240
classes of threats but again once you've

333
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,160
found the threat

334
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,440
you don't need to start classifying it

335
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,360
which bucket does it fit in it's not

336
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,120
that kind of scheme it's just about the

337
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,680
structured brainstorming and spoofing

338
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,959
spoofing is all about identity

339
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,880
who am i who are you

340
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,000
pretending to be somebody you're not

341
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,079
tampering is about playing with data

342
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,600
until something breaks

343
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,720
trying to

344
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,200
harm the integrity of that data

345
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,920
repudiation is claiming you didn't do

346
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,760
something which you ostensibly did

347
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,440
claiming something didn't happen and

348
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,600
making it a way that you can't prove it

349
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,680
that i did do it

350
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,839
information disclosure of course is uh

351
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,839
harming the confidentiality

352
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,880
of data denial of service is blocking

353
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,480
the availability of the system and

354
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,920
there's a lot of different ways to slice

355
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,360
and dice this right it might be the

356
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,279
whole server crashes it might be one

357
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,079
module is not available you can't log in

358
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,440
whatever

359
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,200
it might be one user it might be all

360
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,320
users there's a lot of different ways to

361
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,519
look at this

362
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,399
and finally elevation of privileges

363
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,279
excuse me is all about authorization

364
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,880
basically doing anything that you

365
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,800
shouldn't be allowed to do

366
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,040
and the way we do this is we go one

367
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,519
bucket at a time once one of the stride

368
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,680
elements at a time we go through that

369
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,920
dfd that data flow diagram one element

370
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,000
at a time and we ask very focused

371
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,480
questions what kind of spoofing threats

372
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,160
are there on this element what kind of

373
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,760
tampering threats are there on that

374
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,440
element

375
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,279
and in this way we can find ask

376
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,160
questions and find and identify a lot of

377
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,399
those issues

378
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,240
now this is a common framework

379
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,160
i want to go ahead and take this

380
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,120
framework and apply it on more complex

381
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,360
systems real world systems

382
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,839
an actual

383
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,440
community now we need to ask ourselves

384
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,560
whose responsibility is it to be doing

385
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,800
this threat modeling thing well pretty

386
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,720
much everyone and the interesting thing

387
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,560
is that most people do some form of

388
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,959
threat modeling in the real world they

389
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,200
most people have some idea of what the

390
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,040
threats are you're parking in a dark

391
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,720
alley you're going to lock your car

392
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,399
right you're buying a new house or

393
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,920
building a new house you might be

394
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,839
worried about the ground floor windows

395
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,040
so you're going to put bars on the

396
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,720
windows because you're worried about a

397
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,800
velociraptor attack

398
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,399
or thieves i don't know i don't know

399
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,720
your life whatever

400
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,560
zombies whatever it is don't talk to me

401
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,240
about zombies

402
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,760
the problem is that most people are not

403
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,839
experts in all of those fields don't

404
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,480
have rigorous structure for that that's

405
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,880
why it's important to use this

406
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,279
structured framework

407
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,800
structured methodology that help you

408
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,440
approach and design and design and

409
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,839
understand the threat model of whatever

410
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:36,160
it is you're working on

411
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,839
and it's important to note

412
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,680
all threat models are wrong some are

413
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,600
useful this is not the original quote i

414
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,920
like to mangle it as all threat models

415
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,000
are wrong some are useful the threat

416
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,920
model is not about perfection it doesn't

417
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,000
need to be exact by definition we're

418
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,760
dealing with abstractions so they're not

419
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,000
exact what's important is that it is

420
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,120
useful

421
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,839
is useful to find and identify those

422
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,399
security issues right it's fine that

423
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,760
it's wrong as long as it is useful to us

424
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,680
to find issues that we need to fix

425
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,320
with that in mind i want to present a

426
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,760
very wrong model a model that is not

427
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,079
comprehensive not complete it's not any

428
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,240
kind of formal model but it might be

429
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,800
useful for us to help to think about how

430
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,279
to deal with these threats that might be

431
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,160
on a community

432
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,440
first thing we need to ask ourselves

433
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,160
what actually is a community we need to

434
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,399
model the system we're working on before

435
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,160
we model the threats

436
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:34,880
well

437
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,480
easy flippant answer is that community

438
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,959
is a jungle

439
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,480
it's pretty fitting here but truthfully

440
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,560
you know it's a great theme for a

441
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,079
conference it's not really the way you

442
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,320
want to leave your lives you'd rather

443
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,199
live in a more rule-based society where

444
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,320
people

445
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,959
respect the rules and are safe

446
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,480
and

447
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,240
you know you can address

448
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,000
lots of different forms of communities

449
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
but most pretty much fit into these

450
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,680
principles number one

451
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,040
the reason

452
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,279
you're joining a community a community

453
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,040
is to help each other that's why you're

454
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,440
here right you're here to help each

455
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,360
other do the thing whatever that thing

456
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,600
is right here the thing is to learn

457
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,480
security to do security better right

458
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,680
every community will have different

459
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,480
rules but every community has rules and

460
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,560
everyone expect is expected to comply

461
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,800
with them to follow those rules

462
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,959
and in every community everybody

463
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,160
contributes in some form in some manner

464
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,399
and it's very important that all members

465
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,639
of the community are important if you

466
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,240
have members that are not important

467
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,759
they're not really part of the community

468
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,240
or maybe they're part of a parallel

469
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,800
community because i mean that's really

470
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,839
the point

471
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,440
of the community we're here to help each

472
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,720
other

473
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,399
that's the point of it

474
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,079
but if we're modeling a community as a

475
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,680
complex system

476
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,920
that really means that we need to treat

477
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,560
we need to attend to people as if they

478
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,240
are components of that complex system

479
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,560
and like any complex system

480
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,240
some components go rogue some components

481
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,639
don't follow the rules some compute some

482
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,800
components are not supportive of the

483
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,560
community goals

484
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,920
in security we like to talk about

485
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,360
insider threats being a pretty big issue

486
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,360
we need to talk about community insider

487
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,839
threats as well

488
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,560
now obviously for modeling a community a

489
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,959
data flow diagram is not what really fit

490
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,720
here it doesn't work

491
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,240
we might want something more like a

492
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,240
worldly map really interesting structure

493
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,120
that helps you focus on the value flow

494
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,759
between the components of the system

495
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,920
focusing on who contributes who are the

496
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,519
leaders who actually benefits from the

497
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,959
different activities and the different

498
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,199
contributions of the community and all

499
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,199
the different levels of the flows of

500
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,279
power dynamics between the different

501
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,360
parts of the community

502
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,120
between the different groups between the

503
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,880
in crowds and and the outcrowds and so

504
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,839
on

505
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,399
all right now based on that we can now

506
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,199
have this amorphous idea of a community

507
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,599
and start thinking about what kind of

508
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,760
threats we may find and you know i do

509
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,199
want to say you know we're talking about

510
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,400
real life actual physical threats

511
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,079
so if you're feeling uncomfortable by

512
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,000
anything i say you know if you feel like

513
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,280
you need to step out that's fine i

514
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,720
promise i won't be insulted and i

515
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,919
apologize for making you feel

516
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,919
uncomfortable but that's fine

517
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,000
that said let's talk about spoofing

518
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,919
threats

519
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,240
spoofing is all about attacks on

520
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,400
identity that's literally what spoofing

521
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,880
is and there are all kinds of these kind

522
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,640
of threats in a community and these are

523
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,480
just examples this is not a

524
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,880
comprehensive model in any way just

525
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,120
examples of how to think about what we

526
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,720
should be looking for

527
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,320
the first example is pretending to be an

528
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,440
expert on something you know what i'm

529
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,120
not an expert on this this is definitely

530
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,120
not my field there are people who are

531
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,840
experts on social threats

532
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,440
but i'm learning i want to share that

533
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,720
but there are people get up and tell you

534
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,320
they're experts and you know they claim

535
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,080
to have certifications and and yet they

536
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,840
have roles i mean how many directors of

537
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,320
8200 were there in the past year

538
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,600
we all know people like that that

539
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,360
pretend they're experts on things and

540
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,080
they're really not

541
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,919
another form of attack on identity is on

542
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,360
other people's identity is misgendering

543
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,360
right not respect not being respectful

544
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,840
of their identity or dead naming when

545
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,559
you use a person's uh pre-transition

546
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,640
name that's not respectful is very

547
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,840
harmful makes people feel

548
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,840
attacked another form of spoofing

549
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,840
putting your name on somebody else's

550
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,880
work or claiming their ideas are yours

551
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,600
changing their identity

552
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,760
and then there's this whole idea of you

553
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,320
know the good guy who's up there and and

554
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,679
pretending to be the good guy who thinks

555
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,120
they are the good guy and you get to

556
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,799
things like the innocent lives project

557
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,240
was which is a group

558
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,160
dedicated to helping and preventing uh

559
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,400
preventing child abuse that was actually

560
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,880
run by an abuser which leads to a whole

561
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,240
you know grooming conversation

562
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,360
pretend to be somebody good and it's

563
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,960
gotten to the point where somebody told

564
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,280
me you know any middle-aged white guy

565
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,600
that wants to talk publicly

566
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,840
about these topics is probably a yellow

567
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,440
flag right there and you know i can't

568
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,000
blame them for saying that

569
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,760
but let's talk about tampering let's

570
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,600
talk about tampering threats and again

571
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,320
it's all about attacks on integrity and

572
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,240
there's a lot of different ways to look

573
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,799
at what integrity means for a community

574
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,360
for you know real life uh

575
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,280
social uh

576
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,799
environment

577
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,799
one way to look at it and this is

578
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,640
something that i have done in the past

579
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,120
is my mistake mia culpa if you include

580
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,400
somebody who

581
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,200
produces or uh uh

582
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,760
who produces software weapons and sells

583
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,600
them to dictators who chase down and

584
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,200
murder their citizens

585
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,559
and you introduce that person as a

586
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,280
speaker at your conference at your event

587
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,280
and again this is something kind of a

588
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,600
slow-moving mistake that i

589
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,039
kind of my fault and i couldn't stop it

590
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,280
once it got started it harms the

591
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,000
integrity of that event and it did it

592
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
harms the integrity of that organization

593
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,559
long term and it does

594
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,520
and this harms the integrity

595
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,039
another way of looking at it integrity

596
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,600
of truth misinformation right or deep

597
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,200
fakes right those fake videos that make

598
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,559
it look like i'm saying something or

599
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:17,840
make it look like obama's saying

600
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,679
something that he didn't right

601
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:24,000
it's all about the integrity of the data

602
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,440
and then there's man this new thing

603
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,880
called mansplaining do you all know what

604
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,320
mansplaining is

605
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,559
mansplaining is when a man

606
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,960
condescendingly interrupts a woman to

607
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,760
explain to her what she's already saying

608
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,520
i i like to think of this as

609
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,039
conversational man in the middle

610
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,440
repudiation is about claiming something

611
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,960
that didn't happen it might be you

612
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,799
didn't do something or something that

613
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,400
did happen claiming you didn't like you

614
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,880
know holocaust denial right

615
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,799
being able to prove it

616
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,480
and in our context we might be talking

617
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,000
about things like gaslighting make a

618
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,480
person doubt what they perceive as

619
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,960
reality make them feel crazy

620
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,600
right or you know making sexualized

621
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,679
jokes at the expense of somebody else

622
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,120
and saying no i didn't mean it was just

623
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,559
a joke she can't take a joke girl's

624
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,640
crazy

625
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,679
plausible deniability

626
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,120
and it's also about

627
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,360
doubting somebody else's experiences

628
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,799
somebody comes to you and says something

629
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,880
happens you say well where's the proof

630
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,480
you don't need proof the proof is in

631
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,080
their experience

632
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,440
you don't need to pretend that it didn't

633
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,919
happen that's not cool

634
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,280
and then there's this story about this

635
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,799
beautifully disgusting term that i just

636
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,799
heard that i learned recently called

637
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,159
darvo

638
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,559
which is actually a common uh tactic

639
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,799
used by abusers that if they get called

640
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,720
out for misbehavior

641
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,799
they go on the offense they deny it ever

642
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:43,760
happened

643
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,280
they go on the offense they attack the

644
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,360
per the a person complaining against

645
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,799
them and they pretend that they're the

646
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,880
victim and the person complaining is

647
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,559
actually the one that's abusing them

648
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,880
instead of the other way around

649
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,400
again you're repudiating the truth

650
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,840
you're creating what actually happened

651
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,240
information disclosure this is something

652
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,600
that we're familiar with right any kind

653
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,159
of secrecy confidentiality we we're

654
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,080
familiar with that in our context we'll

655
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,159
be talking about things like outing

656
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:11,520
outing somebody that is gay having

657
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,679
somebody that is trans outing somebody

658
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,480
uh in all kinds of ways

659
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,159
or we can talk about doxing leaking your

660
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,320
personal information on the internet

661
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,080
right i don't want people knowing where

662
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,080
i live and following me home stealing uh

663
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,400
uh food for my tree lead to stalking

664
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,760
right or obviously much worse than that

665
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,000
we could also talk about sharing

666
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,080
non-consensual photos for example it

667
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,200
might be if i took a picture of

668
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,400
everybody in the crowd that didn't want

669
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,960
to be posted online or much worse

670
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,960
sometimes there's intimate photos that

671
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,320
you may have shared with your

672
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,000
ex partner

673
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,440
and after breaking up they post it

674
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,520
online sometimes known as revenge porn

675
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,679
very unpleasant causes a lot of damage

676
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,320
to the community

677
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,960
denial of service is all about attacking

678
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,120
access preventing access to the

679
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,280
community preventing access to

680
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,720
opportunities

681
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,080
and it might be something simple like

682
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,679
saying you know

683
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,360
you know very explicitly you're not you

684
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,440
know we don't allow gingers in here

685
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,240
sorry sorry jesse good

686
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,400
but it might be something a lot less

687
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,559
explicit like saying everybody's welcome

688
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,559
here and we have shirts for everybody as

689
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,640
long as you have a normative male body

690
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,080
right it might be something

691
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,200
a little bit more subtle like that

692
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,039
and then there's gatekeeping and say you

693
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,039
know i don't mind having women and

694
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,400
speaking at the conference but she has

695
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,600
to prove that she's really good i don't

696
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,159
want the quality to go down like i have

697
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,240
to prove it prove it to me that you are

698
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,480
really know what you're saying right

699
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,080
which is similar to any kind of

700
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,080
discrimination right having different

701
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,080
rules for different people based on

702
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,840
whatever quality it

703
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,799
is and then there's a distributed flavor

704
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,880
of dos as well

705
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,279
microaggressions are just a constant

706
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:00,320
stream of tiny pinpricks and much like a

707
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,240
network-based ddos

708
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,840
you can handle one packet you can handle

709
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,520
100 packets if you start having to deal

710
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,559
with 10 000 packets every second

711
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,320
your system is going to get overwhelmed

712
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,919
if you have to deal with all these tiny

713
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,520
pin bricks which might be just a stupid

714
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,440
comment which is not a big deal in

715
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,200
isolation but if you have to deal with

716
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,120
hundreds of these every day or thousands

717
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,200
of these every day

718
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,679
every day every day it starts to wear

719
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,000
down and takes an emotional toll and

720
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,159
these people can no longer

721
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,480
be contributing as fully contributing to

722
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,760
the community because they're simply

723
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,320
overwhelmed

724
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,520
finally we need to talk about elevation

725
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,440
of privilege and elevation privilege is

726
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,400
about consent doing things

727
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,320
that shouldn't be done

728
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,760
it might be simple things like

729
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,640
harassment obviously or any kind of

730
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,080
physical content that

731
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,840
physical contact that is not wanted

732
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,240
especially after it's been after they

733
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,000
said over and over again you know don't

734
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,840
touch me no more

735
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,000
and then we can talk about violence and

736
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,480
all other forms of assault and to be

737
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,520
honest

738
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,200
i don't feel like i can actually talk

739
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,600
about this in this context without

740
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,679
completely trivializing victims of

741
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,000
assault and that's just not okay so i'm

742
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,279
not going to do this i'm going to leave

743
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,919
this as a thought exercise and it's

744
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,000
worth thinking about in this context in

745
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,240
this

746
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,400
in this frame of looking for these

747
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,000
issues

748
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,679
but we could also think about any kinds

749
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,600
of abusive power use of privilege

750
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,600
because there's always going to be

751
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,840
people that have power in the community

752
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,279
there are flows of power there are

753
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,440
different uh contexts where you might

754
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,360
have power over other people you abuse

755
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,600
that that's not cool

756
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,600
but then we can talk about patterns of

757
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,720
abuse

758
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,000
right because if somebody has done

759
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,559
something wrong three or four times odds

760
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,360
are they did it 30 or 40 times

761
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,200
and you know we might be able to run

762
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,039
yara rules to be able to identify

763
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,559
network patterns

764
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:55,840
but here we have to know what to look

765
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,760
for and if they've done it 30 or 40

766
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,440
times if they got away with it for 30

767
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,279
times they're doing something bad

768
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,799
they're probably going to be getting

769
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,960
worse and getting away with a lot more

770
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,880
especially when they have people backing

771
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,159
them up and saying no they didn't do

772
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,480
anything bad it's fine leave them alone

773
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,640
it's not their fault

774
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,960
as i said this is a completely wrong

775
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,039
incomplete model but i think it might be

776
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,840
useful for thinking about these threats

777
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,400
in this context and understanding how

778
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,200
these things actually affect

779
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,360
the people the members of the community

780
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,840
and the community as a whole

781
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,440
now wouldn't it be a threat modeling

782
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,799
talk if we didn't talk about

783
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,080
countermeasures

784
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,360
we have to talk about character measures

785
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,120
as part of threat modeling so i can talk

786
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,279
about preventive controls number one

787
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,360
just simply banning people that you know

788
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,520
have abused in the past somebody has

789
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,720
this pattern of abusing 30 40 50 times

790
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,720
don't let them be part of the community

791
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,159
don't let them continue to attend events

792
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:53,840
there are activities that never end well

793
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,039
right you're gonna have an open bar

794
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,559
everybody's getting stinking drunk all

795
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:57,760
night long

796
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,080
at some point it's not gonna end well

797
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,760
trying to have some kind of uh meet up

798
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,840
in a strip joint that's not gonna end

799
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,880
well for anybody that's not gonna be

800
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,720
comfortable for anybody simply don't

801
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,000
have these

802
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,679
and with just a little bit of compassion

803
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,240
and empathy we can realize that

804
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,520
supporting mental health goes a long way

805
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,520
we may even be able to prevent some of

806
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,799
these issues

807
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,360
at the root after cause

808
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,720
we could also talk about detective

809
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,640
controls

810
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,399
situational awareness always a good

811
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,320
thing being aware what's going on around

812
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,480
you paying attention if she's if you see

813
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,880
somebody that is visible visibly

814
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,960
uncomfortable from somebody else you

815
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,799
should notice that and handle it in

816
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,240
whatever way

817
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,640
and to do that you need to really have

818
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,399
every event needs to have the volunteers

819
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,080
running at the organizers

820
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,320
that are the kind of people that other

821
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,399
people feel comfortable coming to and

822
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,080
telling them

823
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,480
what happened

824
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,000
we could also talk about administrative

825
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,159
controls things like a code of conduct

826
00:27:58,159 --> 00:27:59,919
which karen talked about we have a great

827
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,320
code of conduct here

828
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,320
having

829
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,039
explicit process and policies

830
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,679
explicitly following the incident

831
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,919
handler playbooks if something bad does

832
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,480
happen and being able to actually comply

833
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,120
with the results of that playbook

834
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,799
com stick to the results of those

835
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,080
decisions

836
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,399
there's also what i would like to call

837
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:24,799
strategic controls or environmental

838
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,960
controls and this is something like

839
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,840
having a diverse

840
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,440
community having a diverse community can

841
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,760
help battle that environment where

842
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,080
people feel free to perform those

843
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,320
threats it's kind of a

844
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,880
hurt immunity to some extent not having

845
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,960
a diverse community or having not having

846
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,120
diversity in your company actually harms

847
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,200
everybody even the people that are not

848
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,039
explicitly excluded

849
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,640
but everybody else suffers from not

850
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,799
having that diversity but if you can

851
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,200
build up that community if you can build

852
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,559
up a community

853
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:00,000
stated around those shared values

854
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,520
and shared values might be something

855
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,520
like everybody's a noob

856
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,840
right everybody's learning everybody

857
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,919
shares everybody learns women should be

858
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,600
safe everybody should be safe if you

859
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,200
know these are the values of the

860
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,279
community then that helps create that

861
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,039
environment

862
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,240
that prevents

863
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,159
those threats being

864
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:19,279
manifest

865
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,760
and enforce those cultural norms

866
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,440
if this is the way that we do things

867
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,600
then people feel more comfortable and if

868
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,080
you can build up these bonds between the

869
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,799
community people have that built up

870
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:33,120
level of trust and that's really what

871
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,960
threat modeling is about finding those

872
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,799
connections those levels of trust

873
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,919
we don't want a zero trust community we

874
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,320
want to build that up right and that

875
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,399
helps prevent it now all these different

876
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:47,919
controls preventive detective

877
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,240
administrative strategic actually all

878
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,880
rely on one other i would call like an

879
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,760
uber control kind of the blue team

880
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,360
of community

881
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,760
and that's allies

882
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,039
allies are

883
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,279
underlying everything else and allies

884
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:06,880
are what drives all the other controls

885
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,039
now i'm not here

886
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:11,600
to give an ode to allies and yes allies

887
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,120
are super important

888
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,039
if you're not trying to be an ally you

889
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:17,360
might be part of the problem right

890
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,360
i'm not here to sing praises to allies

891
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,200
though i'm here to make demands

892
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,120
because if you want to try to be an ally

893
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,039
the number one thing that is most

894
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,640
important and this is not me being a

895
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,159
brilliant person this is just what

896
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,159
everybody what i've heard from everybody

897
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:32,159
else the number one most important thing

898
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,279
for allies to do is to listen

899
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:38,080
to listen to those who are marginalized

900
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,399
to listen to those who might be abused

901
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,880
in some way to listen to survivors of

902
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,039
those attacks

903
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,240
the second most important thing for

904
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,320
allies to do is to speak up you hear

905
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,000
something going on something's not right

906
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,760
you speak up you get up in the face you

907
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,760
stop what's ever bad from happening so

908
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,159
if you ask me from you know why is avi

909
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,440
speaking here this is why

910
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,519
allies need to step up and help not just

911
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,600
listen to the marginalized but help

912
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,519
everybody else hear them as well

913
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,720
and you know everybody has some form of

914
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,720
social power social capital some

915
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,039
privilege some earned authority allies

916
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,399
will consistently

917
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,559
and effectively use the power and

918
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,240
privilege and authority that they have

919
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,600
for the common good for everyone else

920
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,760
in some ways you work in public to make

921
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,440
that change happen

922
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,799
so i'm good gear but you don't have to

923
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:32,480
be on stage talking

924
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,039
for far too long like uh well

925
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,720
you know

926
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,000
change can happen quietly as well

927
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,559
allies insist that proper security

928
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,880
controls are in place and they drive to

929
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,640
make sure that they're effective code of

930
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,240
conduct don't join an event without a

931
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,880
code of conduct um having diversity

932
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,960
equity inclusion policies driving more

933
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,279
and more diversity throughout and all

934
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:56,480
these other things that we talked about

935
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,840
it's allies that can drive us

936
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,200
because the people that are marginalized

937
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,600
the people that are most affected by not

938
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,360
having this in place are not the ones

939
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,600
that should be responsible for making a

940
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,039
safe environment

941
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:10,320
they already have enough to deal with

942
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,000
they probably don't have the power to

943
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,399
make it happen anyway

944
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,000
allies do

945
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,480
and allies don't do this to get a cookie

946
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,000
right i did something good i want to

947
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,080
treat no not to get recognition or

948
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,880
attention or being on stage or whatever

949
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,760
allies do this because it's what's right

950
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,760
it's because what is fair until all of

951
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,240
us are free no one is free

952
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,840
and evidence and it happens you know we

953
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,080
don't have an uncomfortable conversation

954
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,320
or you know the speaker is saying

955
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,000
harmful stuff i don't want to drag him

956
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,519
off stage in the middle absolutely if

957
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,519
i'm saying something harmful

958
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,760
drag me off stage before it continues to

959
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,760
harm other people focus on harm

960
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,960
reduction

961
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,120
the most important thing is safety of

962
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,360
everybody else

963
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,720
and including if there's a speaker

964
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,480
that's causing harm you get rid of them

965
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,519
if there's a known abuser in the

966
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,640
community

967
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,720
you get rid of them

968
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,559
and if you think it's not possible

969
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:03,600
stanford

970
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,840
actually did a study a couple years ago

971
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,760
of online communities and they found

972
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,760
that one percent

973
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,440
of online communities are responsible

974
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,000
for three quarters 75

975
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,480
of all issues of all conflicts so it's

976
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,640
not just the right thing to do it's also

977
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,039
kind of a good idea

978
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:23,360
being an ally is not one and done it's

979
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,679
not you're never a complete ally

980
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,519
constantly learning you're responsible

981
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,120
to get better

982
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,080
teach yourself teach yourself

983
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,720
teach yourself and help each other get

984
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,600
better

985
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,440
help other allies with compassion you

986
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,919
make a mistake you get better

987
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:41,840
allies knowing to show up whatever is

988
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,600
needed know when to shut up let other

989
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,919
voices be heard and i'm not listening to

990
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:47,200
my own advice because i'm told to get

991
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,559
off the stage

992
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,880
one more minute

993
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,640
sometimes you're not invited to the

994
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,200
party and that's okay

995
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,240
alex ship has to be intersectional and

996
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,320
by that i mean it cannot be conditional

997
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,039
here in israel we most often talk about

998
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,240
needing more

999
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,399
needing more women on stage but it's not

1000
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:08,000
just having more women it's not just

1001
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,199
about gender

1002
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,199
it's not just about gender

1003
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,679
it's about gender representation sexual

1004
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,560
preferences uh race

1005
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,599
and a lot of religion and a lot of other

1006
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,560
factors now this is not like um you know

1007
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,960
a hierarchy of who gets the most uh

1008
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,639
discrimination points now it's an

1009
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,199
interlaced matrix of

1010
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,440
disadvantaged and we all have some power

1011
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,199
we can all step up and realize that you

1012
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,960
can't support one without supporting all

1013
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,879
the others support everybody whoever

1014
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:38,639
they are and realize that there are

1015
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,639
different factors here for example i'm

1016
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,320
sure most people know that women on

1017
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,719
average statistically will earn 80

1018
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,480
percent of what

1019
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,159
a typical man with the same role in the

1020
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,079
same background will earn

1021
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,159
in the united states a black woman will

1022
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,359
earn 60

1023
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,359
62 cents on the dollar

1024
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,599
so it's a combination of both the racism

1025
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,359
and the sexism and all these other

1026
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:01,040
things come together

1027
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,119
another thing allies do

1028
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,520
get tired allies make mistakes i made

1029
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,280
mistakes hell i made definitely my share

1030
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,800
of mistakes i made his share of mistakes

1031
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,760
as well

1032
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,720
plenty of mistakes what we don't do

1033
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,240
is start complaining somebody calls us

1034
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,760
out for making mistake

1035
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,640
we accept it we apologize we move on

1036
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,800
hopefully apologies will be accepted and

1037
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,079
we try better

1038
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,040
now

1039
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,720
a few seconds because i usually leave

1040
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,480
people with a with takeaways but instead

1041
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,839
i want to leave three calls to

1042
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:31,280
action i'll leave three calls to action

1043
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,520
number one threat model everything

1044
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,280
we do security threat modeling is how we

1045
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,280
do security right do it it's part of the

1046
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,960
job that's how we do it

1047
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,760
number two we want to build a community

1048
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,839
it has to be a secure community and that

1049
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:45,760
includes safety and all the other things

1050
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,680
hopefully i gave you a model that will

1051
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,599
help you think about these different

1052
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:52,000
things and understand how to make them

1053
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,079
better and finally

1054
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:56,880
if you feel like you already are an ally

1055
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,040
because you really care deeply about

1056
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,400
these things

1057
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,119
i say great my call to you is to stop

1058
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,079
caring

1059
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,920
and get up and start doing or do more of

1060
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,440
whatever you're doing

1061
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,290
