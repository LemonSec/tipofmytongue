okay so uh this CTF was this impressive

15
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,120
amount of challenges servers and

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,180
infrastructures it was expensive so we

17
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,340
are open for donations

18
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,860

00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,300
um so uh this skill as I said was in in

20
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,000
huge amount of challenges uh we had 26

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,640
challenges seven categories and

22
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,380
1158

23
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,740
unique users

24
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:13,740
[Music]

25
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,400
um

26
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,400
also we had 70 90

27
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:25,159
9683 uh unique IP addresses and

28
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:28,619
681 registered teams

29
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:31,280
we had also

30
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,759
678 soft challenges and 100

31
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:37,740
90 teams

32
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,560
uh okay so

33
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,659
with the most correct submissions with

34
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:47,880
149th submission the medium expectation

35
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,979
challenge

36
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:52,380
was the with the most solves

37
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,619
and the second one was the mode Pawn

38
00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:00,420
with 76 submissions

39
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,219
the high expectation was solved by 61

40
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:06,840
teams

41
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,900
and they guessed the shell codes sold by

42
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,580
57 tips

43
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,420
we heard also the SUV and IntelliJ

44
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,000
Communicator that sold by only one team

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,480
and still remained with two unsolved

46
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,180
challenges called the prefer chair and

47
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,720
only hope

48
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,420
so funny thing

49
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,239
sometimes you can discover Clues within

50
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,760
the challenge names

51
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,140
so yes

52
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:50,160
and every year we get in every time a

53
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,220
wrong submissions for the flags

54
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,800
I will never submit a dummy flag again

55
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,060
and it's made again and

56
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,900
more not funny things

57
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:07,200
they can find here someone make a

58
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,920
generate a flag with no clue from where

59
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,019
it's happened

60
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:16,860
and also Sharon is here Sharon can I

61
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,280
tell her you already married

62
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,800
yeah yeah I don't think his life his

63
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,000
wife will like it

64
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:30,540
so that it's your fault okay so now

65
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,019
we'll talk about the war war stories

66
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:37,920
so we started on May on the 10th of May

67
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,900
and we started uh with the first

68
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:46,440
CTF Meetup and we meet all the creators

69
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,480
all the developers of the challenges

70
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,599
some of them are here people from jctf

71
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,720
but we will talk about them later

72
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,040
um

73
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,819
a lot of sleepless nights

74
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:03,120
huge cicd pipeline I think it will not

75
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,159
shame uh

76
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,980
any company any kind of company or

77
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,560
startup

78
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,480
um and now

79
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,599
I will talk about what the worst that

80
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,858
can associate it already happen

81
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:22,680
or so a lot of things happened in the

82
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,900
CTF and I will start talking about

83
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,720
things that happened that wasn't so

84
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,080
great but it's still funny and it's

85
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,300
still interesting and we're learning

86
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,060
from it and we want you to learn from it

87
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,240
also if you create a CTF the first thing

88
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,900
you need to see is if you have 8 000

89
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,320
users and one thousand eight eight

90
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,560
thousand unique APS and 1000 users

91
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,040
uh ctfd creates a lot of connections to

92
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,300
the database

93
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,220
so

94
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,320
increase the max concerned

95
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,300
concurrent connections

96
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,220
okay

97
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,560
um so we started by having

98
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,340
um

99
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,699
a problem with the mailing server we had

100
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:14,400
a mailing server that didn't work so

101
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,539
nobody got a mail and we started

102
00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:21,360
manually accepting people and I hope

103
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,940
that if you sent us the message you got

104
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,860
accepted right away because we don't

105
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,479
want people to wait

106
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,639
afterwards we had

107
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,900
7 000 unique IPS that means that a lot

108
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,280
of people

109
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,780
actually

110
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,900
use the challenges play the challenges

111
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,259
and also attacked the challenges so when

112
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:49,280
you have so many IPS only on the city FD

113
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,479
I think it's something like

114
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,740
um

115
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,300
more than

116
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,680
10 000 IPS that gone through the

117
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,340
um

118
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,460
frame through the pipeline

119
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,000
that means that we had three nodes in

120
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,300
Amazon and one of the nodes got shut

121
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,120
down and the auto scaling group didn't

122
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,860
work

123
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,419
um but still

124
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:21,020
the CTF managed to

125
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,360
to have all the challenges working

126
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,479
because we had more notes but we added

127
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:31,139
some more so it was at the end three

128
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:34,860
nodes with all the challenges and many

129
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,800
many many pods like something like 200

130
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,720
pods because we had many challenges

131
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,060
26. it's

132
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,819
eight more than every year we created

133
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:51,319
the CTF and it's a lot

134
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:52,979
um

135
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,979
we had one flag leaked I think the

136
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:58,560
Pokemons are crying Ash Ketchum will not

137
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,680
seem they see them again so

138
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:08,220
it's got resisted to be with zero points

139
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,380
and we had

140
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:16,280
um 404 uh challenge that people started

141
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,960
messing the flag and changing the flag

142
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,360
so we created the WAFF in the middle of

143
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,280
the night so people won't change the

144
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,240
flag and we notified everybody that the

145
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,440
challenge is stable

146
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:35,400
um and now Nimrod will talk about the

147
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,160
people that written the challenges

148
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,860
we also want to honor to the CTF

149
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,699
developers who participate by on the

150
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:47,160
building of the CTF it was amazing it

151
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,060
was

152
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:51,240
a lot of day and nights without sleeping

153
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,680
so let's start with jctf team

154
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,879
jctf team

155
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,539
once the group that wounds a lot of

156
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:02,580
times until we say them you can

157
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,979
participate you should come us and join

158

Israel airlift also with the prefecture

164
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:26,340
a via

165
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,979
with the amount of challenges there are

166
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:31,139
a lot of people in a lot of challenges

167
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:34,500
