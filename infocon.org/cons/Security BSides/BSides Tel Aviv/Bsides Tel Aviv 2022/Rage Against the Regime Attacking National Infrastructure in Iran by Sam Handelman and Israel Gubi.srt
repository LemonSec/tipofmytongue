hi hello

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,279
and everyone you for attending our talk

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,359
about the attacks against national

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,880
infrastructure in iran in the last year

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,800
my name is israel i'm working at

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,039
checkpoint and i will be giving this

11
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,279
talk along with my colleagues sam is

12
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,039
also works at checkpoint

13
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,800
and we are both part of the checkpoint

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,370
research

15
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:36,079
[Music]

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,879
in the last year many cyber attacks were

17
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,079
performed against iranian entities

18
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,040
and

19
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,640
many dissident groups took

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,520
responsibility for the different attacks

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,399
and

22
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,360
we

23
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,879
researched some of those attacks and

24
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,120
today we are going to talk about

25
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,960
some of them

26
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,440
the first attack happened last july

27
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,920
whatever seemed as another regular day

28
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,640
in iran turned upside down

29
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,400
the screens in the national railway

30
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,519
stations

31
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,040
started to indicate delays and

32
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,479
cancellations

33
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:09,280
and

34
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,360
behind the scenes what happened is that

35
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,840
the system that are responsible for

36
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,000
locating where are the trains totally

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,360
collapsed

38
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,360
on the screens in the national railway

39
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,680
station a message was displayed

40
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,320
saying long delays due to cyber attacks

41
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,040
more information

42
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,920
64411

43
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,079
and the quick search showed us that the

44
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,479
attackers had some sense of humor as

45
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,560
this number belongs to no other but to

46
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,560
the supreme leader of iran ali khamenei

47
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,880
the next day another attack has happened

48
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,880
now against the ministry of roads and

49
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,479
urban developments

50
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,360
an iranian social media profile posted a

51
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,000
picture of one of the victims

52
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,840
showing a message of the attackers

53
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,000
taking responsibility for both this

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,240
attack and attack the

55
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,360
and the attack the day before

56
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,680
oven okay

57
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,880
so we started to uh

58
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,160
to check if there are any leads for uh

59
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,599
for the attack

60
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,480
and

61
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,920
fortunately for us a padfish

62
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,120
this is an iranian antivirus a posted a

63
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,920
report and sharing some light about what

64
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,400
happened in the attacks

65
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,200
and

66
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,040
padfish probably adds some access to the

67
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,280
malware files as they are the main

68
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,120
endpoint solution for iranian entities

69
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,040
and even though there were no iocs in

70
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,280
the report there were other information

71
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,800
that we could have used

72
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,560
like file names

73
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,200
code snippets the execution flow

74
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,840
and we used this data in order to find

75
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,800
files and we found

76
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,360
dozens of files all uploaded to

77
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,000
aristotle from iran

78
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,840
and even though we couldn't find all the

79
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,599
files from the report

80
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,560
we found we we managed to recover most

81
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,720
of the execution flow

82
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,720
and the execution flow was assembled

83
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,280
from a lot of script files

84
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,000
and pe tools that performed several

85
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,239
actions such as disconnecting the

86
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,319
computer from the network

87
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,720
and disabling anti-viruses

88
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,560
and in general it had

89
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,440
too many script files uh

90
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,959
in my opinion

91
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,280
and it was a little bit weird uh

92
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,440
execution flow

93
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,440
also with another interesting thing is

94
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,680
that we found a

95
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,799
path in internal internal object names

96
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,799
related to iranian railways in the

97
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,799
scripts what showed us that the

98
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,599
attackers had some of prime knowledge of

99
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,920
the environment of the victims and it

100
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,599
also assured us that we are looking at

101
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,400
the right files

102
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,519
the attack ends with a

103
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,159
unleashing the payload that is eternally

104
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,000
named meteor

105
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,760
and it's responsible for locking the

106
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,120
systems

107
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,640
and wiping the victim's computer

108
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,760
and meteor works only if it has some

109
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,400
configuration file in order to operate

110
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,040
correctly and the fields in the

111
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,120
configuration file are pretty much

112
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,358
straightforward like path to wipe or

113
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,680
processes to kill

114
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,478
and

115
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,479
meteor supports more than 20

116
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,880
configuration fields but it only uses 10

117
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,840
of them

118
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,080
what message what might suggest that

119
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,240
maybe this tool was not created

120
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,880
specifically for this attack

121
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,919
also it gave the attackers some kind of

122
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,000
flexibility in the execution of the

123
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,040
payload

124
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,520
and the opportunity to to tailor every

125
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,680
attack for every victim

126
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,479
and in fact the configuration that we

127
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,240
found in the configuration from the

128
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,320
padfish report was a little bit

129
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,639
different in one of the fields which

130
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,199
showed us that the attackers really used

131
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,120
different configurations for different

132
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,600
victims

133
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,720
and

134
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,720
the wiper starts with writing meteor as

135
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,120
started to a log file and this is where

136
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,520
the name of the malware came from and in

137
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,160
general we want to thank meteor writers

138
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,120
for adding a lot of debug strings in it

139
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,520
what made our life much easier

140
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,120
to analyze

141
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,280
and in terms of functionality meteor is

142
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,520
pretty standard wiper it corrupts the

143
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,360
computer boot configuration changes

144
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,280
passwords it locks the system and wiping

145
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,080
files but not before it changes the

146
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,600
picture

147
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,320
the wallpaper the desktop wallpaper and

148
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,080
the lock screen image to the following

149
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,199
one

150
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,880
and after translating what is written

151
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,919
here

152
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,400
we got long delays due to cyber attacks

153
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,960
for more information six four four one

154
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,199
one and if it looks familiar to you this

155
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,840
is because this is the exact message

156
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,400
that was shown on the platform boards in

157
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,120
the actual attack

158
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,759
so after analyzing a

159
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,639
this attack we try to find if this tool

160
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,919
was ever used in other attacks as well

161
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,039
and we found a in virustotal

162
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,520
three different uh

163
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,680
submitters submits

164
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,039
that

165
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,880
we found files submitted from three

166
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,560
different uh

167
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,240
incidents three different submitters all

168
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,960
of them located in syria

169
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,639
in those files

170
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,160
we found

171
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,520
other versions of the same wiper named

172
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,240
internally comet and stardust

173
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,479
and by the same debug string that we

174
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,800
found in meteor

175
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,440
and we also found the configuration that

176
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,720
status used

177
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,800
and it led us to the victims of those

178
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,440
attacks named katherine group and alfata

179
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,440
petrillium both of them

180
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,639
companies located in syria and we also

181
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,160
found the

182
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,440
image that was

183
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,280
replacing the

184
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,919
desktop wallpaper

185
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,440
and this image starts with an

186
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,560
introduction

187
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,720
i am indra god of war

188
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,560
and it also gives an explanation for the

189
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,199
attack saying that this is because a

190
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,680
category group has connections to the

191
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,599
kutz force

192
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,880
so we started to to search uh

193
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,080
if there were

194
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,319
other attacks on this these groups if

195
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,120
they're any information

196
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,599
and what we found is a tweet by an

197
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,720
account

198
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,599
named surprisingly indra

199
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,680
taking responsibility for those exact

200
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,720
attacks

201
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,360
and crawling through indira's tweets we

202
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,960
found other

203
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,039
attacks that they took responsibility

204
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:35,840
for

205
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,720
a leaked data from those attacks and

206
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,360
many political messages against iranian

207
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,680
regime and its affiliates mostly

208
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,319
hezbollah

209
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,440
and

210
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,759
india took responsibility for several

211
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,520
attacks and most of them co matched our

212
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,960
our data

213
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,199
the first attack was against a company

214
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,520
named alfadex it's this is a syrian

215
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,240
company for exchanging money and it's

216
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,240
suspected to have a connection to

217
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,560
several

218
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,240
several terrorist groups

219
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,400
and in this attack the first version of

220
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,039
the wiper was used named comet

221
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,120
after that they took responsibility for

222
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,039
attack against a company named sham

223
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,599
wings but we don't have any technical

224
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,240
evidence except the tweets by indira and

225
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,240
the data they leaked

226
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,199
also

227
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,039
there are the attacks against al-qaeda

228
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,120
petroleum and category group that they

229
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,000
used a the second version of the wiper

230
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,159
named stardust

231
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,039
and they

232
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,599
they accused them of having ties to the

233
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:38,880
good sports

234
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,760
and in november 2020 they took response

235
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,000
they threatened to attack bania's oil

236
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,279
refinery

237
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,040
but we don't know if this attack really

238
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,440
happened and since then indra stopped

239
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,720
tweeting

240
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,240
and we didn't see any operation by them

241
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,640
until the attacks against the iranian

242
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,959
railways

243
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,800
and there are several connections

244
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,120
between the attacks in syria and the

245
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,839
attacks on the iran wealth stations and

246
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,680
the ministry

247
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,600
first is the execution flow that is

248
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,839
assembled from a lot of bash scripts for

249
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,120
no

250
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,440
clear

251
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:18,880
and

252
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,959
there are a lot of scripts that made the

253
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,440
same functionality

254
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,360
and also the attack announcements in

255
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,160
both of the attacks

256
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,640
what is not working

257
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,920
okay

258
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,600
in both of the attacks

259
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,720
the vic

260
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,720
the attackers didn't try to stay silent

261
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,440
but they posted a picture to the victims

262
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,560
and taking responsibility

263
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,959
and also the main connection is the

264
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,200
payload all of the attacks use the same

265
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,640
payload the same wiper but different

266
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,240
versions of it and we don't have any

267
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,000
indication that this

268
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,839
this tool was ever used by any other

269
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,920
group

270
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,000
also commenting status add the name

271
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,959
indra in it

272
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,680
what makes the correlation the

273
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,839
connection between those tools and indra

274
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,760
even stronger

275
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,240
we still need to remember that indira

276
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,920
didn't take responsibility for the

277
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,200
attack

278
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,519
on irrelevant ways it can be for several

279
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,800
reasons

280
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,120
but still we believe that those attacks

281
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,519
were performed by the same group groups

282
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,880
the same group

283
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,399
for the reason that we stated before

284
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,240
now i will let sam to elaborate about

285
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,720
another attack against iranian

286
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,240
infrastructure that happened earlier

287
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,640
this year

288
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:41,099
[Music]

289
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,800
okay

290
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,880
let's fast forward half a year when

291
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,720
another large attack was carried out

292
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,880
against iranian infrastructure but this

293
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,760
time it was on tv literally

294
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,519
on january 27 2022 a bunch of tv

295
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,440
channels owned by the islamic republic

296
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,160
of iran broadcasting or the irib were

297
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,399
hijacked by attackers and being

298
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,000
state-sponsored tv and radio

299
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,399
broadcasters in iran the irib is

300
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,959
completely controlled by the government

301
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,320
when the attackers disrupted the

302
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,760
broadcast they played a video

303
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,680
they played a video showing the leaders

304
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,079
of the mek a major dissident group in

305
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,360
iran

306
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,079
while showing these images the the video

307
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,160
also called for the assassination of the

308
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,640
supreme leader ali khamenei whose face

309
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,800
you could see here with the red x

310
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,560
while showing these images the video

311
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,399
also oh excuse me

312
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,880
in addition officials respo reported

313
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,120
other attacks on state-operated radio

314
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,640
stations but never specified which

315
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,680
now we began our search on virustotal

316
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,839
searching for anything we could possibly

317
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,839
find related to the attack

318
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,959
well we started finding files right away

319
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,000
thank you virustotal submitters

320
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,760
and then we kept finding

321
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,440
more

322
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,720
and more

323
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,760
and more

324
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,720
and more and more and more and more and

325
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,399
more and more and more files

326
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,720
now among these files we found included

327
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,519
batch scripts to execute uh payloads

328
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,839
audio and video files forensics

329
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,560
artifacts dot net executables

330
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,040
uh and other things as well

331
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,200
we found there was no there were several

332
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,680
notable commonalities among these files

333
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,800
including

334
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,000
tampered compilation timestamps

335
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,320
similar pdb paths

336
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,360
shared vt submitters is reuse of code as

337
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,200
well as reuse of code and similar coding

338
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,880
styles

339
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,720
but even after going through all these

340
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,720
files we still didn't have an infection

341
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,720
chain since the files that we found were

342
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,120
related to later stages of the attack

343
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,639
this might mean that there was an

344
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,200
insider threat which would suggest that

345
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,800
maybe there was no

346
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,800
fishing or exploit used to start the

347
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,120
attack

348
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,839
now let's talk about how they replace

349
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,920
the the video on the tv

350
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,680
we discovered two important files

351
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,560
related to the tv hijacking the first is

352
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,120
the mp4 file this is the file that can

353
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,800
that was displayed on tv during the

354
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,639
attack we also found a file called

355
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:18,240
simpleplayout.exe which replaced uh

356
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,320
which interrupted the broadcast to play

357
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,480
the attacker's video instead

358
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,120
we also uh the attackers also wrote a

359
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,200
batch script to kill and uninstall

360
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,720
software related to the current

361
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,839
broadcast to ensure uh that the video

362
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,279
would play and they replaced the

363
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,639
broadcast service with their own

364
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,279
executable

365
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,079
we also discovered files related to the

366
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,760
radio hijacking

367
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,079
specifically we found a wav file whose

368
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,920
audio was very similar to that of the

369
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,760
mp4 file we found

370
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,000
we also found a program called avar.exe

371
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,320
which plays the wav file that we found

372
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,560
and after killing a different process on

373
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,279
the system called ava.exe now

374
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,440
can you hear me

375
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,320
okay uh so

376
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,320
ava.exe this is just the ava.exe is

377
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,399
probably used to broadcast on the radio

378
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,920
since they killed it and replaced it

379
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,440
with their own binary

380
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,480
and interestingly the name ava suggests

381
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,399
the attack was probably intended for

382
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,120
irib's ava radio station but this was

383
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,399
never publicly confirmed

384
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,760
now surprisingly this wasn't all about

385
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,560
just hijacking tv and radio in fact when

386
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,560
we took a closer look we saw that there

387
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,440
was a destructive operation in play here

388
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,680
specifically we found a wiper that was

389
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,240
used to destroy files in irib's networks

390
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,920
the wiper achieves its goals by

391
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,160
destroying computer files drives and

392
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,480
master boot records but the wiper is

393
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,760
also able

394
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,920
the wiper is also able to clear event

395
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,880
logs

396
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,839
delete backups kill processes change

397
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:57,680
user passwords to prevent people from

398
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,199
being able to access their accounts

399
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,440
now the wiper accepts three different

400
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,440
forms of configuration

401
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,000
including command line arguments

402
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,120
a hard-coded default configuration

403
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,000
or

404
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,440
or it can read from a file called

405
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,440
messywipe.ini

406
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,920
the wiper also has three different modes

407
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,360
of operations

408
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,199
including default

409
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,760
which simply overwrites the first 200

410
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,720
bytes of each chunk of 1024 bytes in the

411
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,839
file

412
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,240
next is full purge

413
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,160
which simply overwrites the entire file

414
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,199
content

415
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,600
and then lastly we have light wipe which

416
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,160
overwrites a specified number

417
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,000
a specified number of chunks via the

418
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,079
configuration which in the hard-coded

419
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,880
configuration here is three

420
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,800
however we found a batch script that we

421
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,639
believe the attackers used to actually

422
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,560
execute this payload

423
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,560
which you can see here they use command

424
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,639
line arguments

425
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,199
to change to reset all passwords to

426
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,519
random strings and log out any active

427
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,839
user

428
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,440
sessions now we found three different

429
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,680
back doors that shared both code

430
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,680
similarities to the wiper as well as

431
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,759
very creative naming conventions

432
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,040
including

433
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,040
wind screening whose primary purpose was

434
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,360
to take screenshots but it also accepts

435
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,040
shell commands

436
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,600
then there's http callback service which

437
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,839
is just a simple rat that is able to

438
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,600
transfer files to and from the cnc

439
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,920
server but a2 also does

440
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,800
execute shell commands when needed

441
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,759
and lastly we have http service which is

442
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,000
a multifunctional back door with a bunch

443
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,320
of features including but certainly not

444
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,160
limited to

445
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,240
transferring files to and from the cnc

446
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,880
server but wait didn't http callback

447
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,480
service do that too okay well it's also

448
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,839
able to uh

449
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,079
guess what it's able to execute show

450
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:57,360
commands

451
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,240
it's

452
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,000
a little bit redundant but what can you

453
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,519
do

454
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,400
and then http service uh interacts with

455
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,760
the cnc server by sending http html

456
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,760
pages like this one which gives the

457
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,839
attacker a nice user interface by just

458
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,079
simply clicking on hyperlinks to send

459
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:19,359
messages or commands back to the door

460
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,720
now how exactly did we connect all of

461
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,319
these files together

462
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,640
well as i mentioned earlier

463
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,319
we started seeing the files come from

464
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,480
the same virus total submitters

465
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,320
right after the attack and most of them

466
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,240
were located in iran

467
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,320
when we found the video file on virus

468
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,320
total we immediately recognized it from

469
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,000
the news so we knew we were on the right

470
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,440
track

471
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,520
connecting the video and audio files to

472
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,360
the malware was very straightforward

473
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,600
since we saw the file path to the video

474
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,679
inside simple playouts configuration

475
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,559
file and we saw that the wav file was

476
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,600
hard coded into avar.exe

477
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,440
we also found batch scripts that were

478
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,039
tampering with software used in

479
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,960
broadcasting environments some of which

480
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,919
we specifically know the irib is using

481
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,880
based on osint

482
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,880
and of course

483
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,960
we sat we had many similarities in the

484
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,630
executables including code reuse

485
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,640
[Music]

486
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,039
now here's a picture perfect example of

487
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,799
such code reuse

488
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,640
where we can see on the left we have a

489
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,799
function called do cmd

490
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:25,760
which

491
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,679
simply executes a shell command this is

492
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,240
from http service and on the right we

493
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,400
have win screening which is another one

494
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,919
of the back doors i mentioned earlier

495
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,280
with the same exact function do cmd same

496
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,440
code same everything

497
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,200
well i think these guys really like to

498
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,840
copy and paste

499
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,679
now personally i could not believe how

500
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,080
lucky we were when investigating the

501
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,640
files on vt when we came across multiple

502
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,799
windows event log files i mean who

503
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,160
uploads that event the event log file

504
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,559
displayed here contain evidence that the

505
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,280
wiper was uh was executed in the iranian

506
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,200
tv network as you can see here the

507
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,480
domain mit-tv dot ir

508
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,240
and in the event message you can see

509
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,640
here the entry point to the wiper that

510
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,039
we found

511
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,440
now the iranian government claimed that

512
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,840
the mek was behind the attack

513
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,559
but they denied any sort of connection

514
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,720
nonetheless iran's claim is logical

515
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,960
because they displayed leaders displayed

516
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,919
the leaders of the mk in support of them

517
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,080
but it's possible the attackers are just

518
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,080
fans or maybe they're trying to mislead

519
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,039
us we don't actually know

520
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,919
now immediately after the attack a

521
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,080
hacker group called predatory sparrow

522
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,160
claimed responsibility on their telegram

523
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,240
channel the morning of the attack they

524
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,919
wrote a message saying that something

525
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,480
good was coming

526
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,760
however

527
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,520
although they took credit for the attack

528
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,360
we don't have any technical proof that

529
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,039
it was really them

530
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,200
i

531
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,400
and another thing to notice is that if

532
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,320
you look at the twitter handle on the

533
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,440
video

534
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,679
it points to a different account called

535
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,799
yom sarnaguni

536
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,240
so guyansar negoni means uprising to

537
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,559
overthrow in farsi

538
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,720
since they this group first appeared in

539
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,520
january 2022 the group has continued to

540
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,600
attack the iranian regime

541
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,480
and in march in april 2022 the group

542
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,240
hacked and defaced the websites of the

543
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,880
ministry of culture and islamic guidance

544
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,280
and the ministry of agriculture jihad

545
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,120
and defaced the their websites with the

546
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,120
image seen here and published leaked

547
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,799
documents and destroyed some of their

548
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:39,919
data

549
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,760
the picture also contains the same

550
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,159
twitter handle yamsarnaguni

551
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,400
and the images of the mek leaders and

552
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,559
again the red x over the supreme leaders

553
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:49,679
face

554
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,880
now at the beginning of june 2022

555
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,039
the group hacked into over 5 000

556
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,280
surveillance cameras and online services

557
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,159
of the tehran municipality and leaked

558
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,840
videos online showing what they had

559
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,159
accomplished

560
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,960
and then during this time we also saw

561
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,600
uploads to virustotal of new variants of

562
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,440
the back doors and the wiper that we

563
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,240
found in the irib attacks

564
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,480
and in fact the wiper the uh the new

565
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,840
variants of the wiper that we found

566
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,000
seemed to be have a new name and it was

567
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,240
called dilemma based on the pdb paths we

568
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,080
saw

569
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,799
and now for some breaking news

570
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,039
just earlier this week on monday june

571
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,760
27th there was a major cyber attack

572
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,440
conducted against iranian steel

573
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,919
companies now our friends at predatory

574
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,080
sparrow took credit for the tv that took

575
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,159
credit for the tv hijacking posted a

576
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,840
video of one of the attacks on their

577
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,640
telegram channel and claim that they hit

578
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,880
three different iranian steel companies

579
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,039
with ties to the irgc

580
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,640
they also said that the attacks were

581
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,559
carried out in such a way to ensure

582
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,080
people wouldn't be harmed when

583
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,559
destroying infrastructure

584
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
so what do we know so far about these

585
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,200
guys

586
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,600
well attacks on critical infrastructure

587
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,600
require highly skilled attackers because

588
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,600
they need to stay under the radar during

589
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,280
initial initial stages and

590
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,880
reconnaissance

591
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,400
implying that we're dealing with a very

592
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,480
sophisticated group

593
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,480
but on the other hand the payloads were

594
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,559
filled with copy and pasted code and

595
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,559
launched by buggy three-line batch

596
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,640
scripts which demerit demonstrated a

597
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,880
lower level of sophistication this

598
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,320
contradiction could have a number of

599
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,840
explanations

600
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,720
maybe they had help on the inside

601
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,120
maybe this the this was a collaboration

602
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,880
of multiple groups with different skill

603
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,799
levels

604
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,720
maybe we can just ask them on telegram

605
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,919
because i definitely have a lot of

606
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:42,400
questions for them

607
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,720
thank you guys very very much if you

608
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,720
have any questions for us please feel

609
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,919
free to call us at six four four one one

610
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,640

611
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:00,710
[Applause]

612
