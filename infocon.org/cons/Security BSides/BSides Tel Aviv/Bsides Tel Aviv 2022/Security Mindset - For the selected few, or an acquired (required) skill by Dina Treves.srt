june 25th

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,760
2019.

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,000
i'm thrilled to go to intel's first

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,640
security conference in israel

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,400
excited about learning new things and

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,640
for that i'm willing to travel to haifa

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,400
three days in a row

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,599
that means

14
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,239
switching trains at tel aviv university

15
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,200
train station and riding for an hour and

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,760
a half in each direction

17
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,640
as i'm waiting for the train to haifa

18
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,520
i notice this

19
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,360
seriously

20
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,719
do you actually believe that i would

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,559
connect my phone

22
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:51,760
to that

23
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,320
malware spyware injecting machine

24
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,840
i'm dina trevis and security is not part

25
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,280
of my job title

26
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,239
it's part of my life

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,720
before i came to the conference my only

28
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,920
experience with security was detecting

29
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,240
simulated phishing emails that were sent

30
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,680
by i.t

31
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,200
to raise our security awareness

32
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,159
like this

33
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,360
lovely

34
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,600
if you press the link

35
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,320
you would reach a web-based training

36
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,119
about phishing

37
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,200
but today we're even more advanced and

38
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,840
we have an add-on button in outlook that

39
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,560
says report fish and if we press it

40
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,880
we get this message

41
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,960
in any case i did not fall for those

42
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,680
phishing emails and after four failed

43
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,079
attempts i got an email saying

44
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,159
thank you for keeping intel secure take

45
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,520
the training anyway here's a link

46
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,920
just how gullible do you think i am

47
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,759
how do i know it's not another phishing

48
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,280
attempt

49
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,360
so i opened my browser i went to my

50
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,759
learning to see the assigned trainings

51
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,119
oh i guess i was assigned with that

52
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,479
training

53
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,920
well better safe than sorry

54
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,800
when i got to the conference i noticed

55
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,959
that most of the people are security

56
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,760
professionals i hardly knew anyone but

57
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,520
that didn't matter because

58
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,120
i was fascinated by all the

59
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,720
presentations

60
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,200
i learned about have i been pawned

61
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,800
this website that can tell you whether

62
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,800
an account that connected with your

63
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,040
email or your phone had a security

64
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,879
breach

65
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,599
a while ago we received such an email

66
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,440
what is this account i don't remember

67
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,280
this account

68
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,440
and then we remembered that

69
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,319
when my daughter was in junior high we

70
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,400
needed to rent a locker for her and we

71
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,560
needed to open an account

72
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,160
the company that we rented the locker

73
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,879
from was sold bought merged whatever

74
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,440
and the database was transferred also to

75
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,120
another company that's why we did not

76
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,480
recognize it

77
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,879
the more accounts one has

78
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,879
the more chances of information leak

79
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,280
the highlight of the conference was the

80
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,720
last day

81
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,480
when i had two workshops the first

82
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,599
was a workshop that showed how easy it

83
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,400
is

84
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,080
to do a man-in-the-middle attack on a

85
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,480
wi-fi network

86
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,799
so i was really glad that i

87
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,560
trusted my instinct who told me that

88
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,680
connecting to a free wi-fi network in a

89
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,400
conference full of hackers is probably

90
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,440
not a very good idea

91
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,680
there was of course free wi-fi at the

92
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,799
conference

93
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,959
what kind of password is that

94
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,799
you need a robust password like this

95
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,720
this is a lot harder to guess

96
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,080
but there was no need to guess because

97
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,159
it was displayed on a sign with the

98
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,480
network name and the password

99
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,480
out of curiosity how many of you are

100
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,959
connected to the free wi-fi here

101
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,040
raise your hands

102
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,920
how many aren't connected

103
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,599
and the rest are probably disabling

104
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,560
wi-fi right now

105
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,400
the second workshop was secured

106
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,319
development mindset and at the end of

107
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,840
that workshop i went to the instructor

108
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,920
and said i want to be a security

109
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,320
advocate i wanted to know everybody i

110
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,000
want everybody to know how important

111
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,240
security is whether it is in everyday

112
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,840
life or to make our products more

113
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,840
resilient

114
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,800
raising security awareness means you

115
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,520
need to do a mindset switch

116
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,280
usually when we develop develop a

117
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,199
product we think with a functional

118
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,320
mindset

119
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,400
we want the product to do what it's

120
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,440
supposed to do and if the product

121
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,080
doesn't behave properly because of

122
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,440
misconfiguration that's the user's

123
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,800
problem right

124
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,759
i mean

125
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,479
the manual specifically states that the

126
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,800
user is responsible to configure the

127
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,120
registers with valid values and

128
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,199
according to the sequence as defined in

129
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,199
the spec

130
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,960
and what if the user is not responsible

131
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,800
security mindset

132
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,880
also makes sure that the product doesn't

133
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,479
do what it's not supposed to do

134
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,080
and what if the user isn't nice

135
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,240
let's look at the following guidelines

136
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,600
you have a sequence that you should

137
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,280
follow and a range of valid values

138
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,400
the responsible user would think about

139
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,120
use cases

140
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,479
well even without malicious intents i

141
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,560
would say it is interesting to know what

142
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,240
would happen if you configured the

143
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,720
register not according to the sequence

144
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,759
and

145
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,680
i would love to see what the unexpected

146
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,440
results would be if i configured an

147
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,440
invalid value

148
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,840
the attacker would think about abuse

149
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,239
cases

150
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,000
so doing the mindset switch

151
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,840
means that

152
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,400
we need to do a lot of training and

153
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,360
learning

154
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,960
and here's the thing

155
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,520
why would a developer designer

156
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,319
validation engineer or manager whose

157
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,479
main job is not security

158
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,479
bother to do all these things

159
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,400
don't they have enough on the plate

160
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,039
what are we paying cecil for

161
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,120
of course one could say that

162
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,560
we will make those trainings mandatory

163
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,319
everyone will be required to take them

164
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,479
and if you don't take them you will

165
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,720
start getting annoying emails with the

166
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,080
words mandatory and deadline and your

167
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,680
manager will be copied on that email

168
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,000
but i believe that security trainings

169
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,360
and activities should not be assigned

170
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,360
they should be wait listed

171
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,440
like the wi-fi hacking

172
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,680
workshop that i attended

173
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,800
but how do we get to that point

174
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,240
how do we make

175
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,720
people want to engage in security

176
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,240
activity in security learning

177
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,520
well

178
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,199
externally

179
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,880
we pay them money

180
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,199
and bring them fame

181
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,759
we want those creative brilliant people

182
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,000
on our side

183
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,800
and internally

184
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,000
a little branding never hurt anyone

185
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,639
security belt certifications in various

186
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,400
paths

187
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,560
see my verified achievement some

188
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,199
linkedin swag

189
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,479
awards for security leadership

190
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,880
awards and recognition for bug of the

191
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,000
month

192
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,639
vulnerability of the week whatever

193
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,160
and ctfs

194
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,199
they're fun and they're addictive

195
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,120
i participated in my first ctf

196
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,199
about a few months ago

197
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,280
it was face to face and it was really

198
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,199
nice to see people from my department

199
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,199
taking more interest in security

200
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,840
we were divided to groups and we had to

201
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,680
solve the challenges together since we

202
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,680
were beginners we had a lot of help from

203
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,560
the instructors it was a good start

204
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,960
and then i participated in another ctf

205
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,960
virtually a couple of weeks ago

206
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,960
not for beginners

207
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,919
unfortunately due to time zone issues i

208
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,400
could not be part of a team

209
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,039
let's just say that i was not the top of

210
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,639
the leaderboard

211
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,840
but

212
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,720
i was not the bottom either

213
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,160
every time you learn something new

214
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,919
and

215
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,400
security quizzes i participated in a fun

216
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,799
workshop well you didn't really have to

217
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,479
know how to program in a specific

218
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,760
language it was more about the concept

219
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,120
they showed us

220
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,200
implementations we had to identify the

221
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,440
problems and think of a better way to

222
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,959
approach this

223
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,080
and for the more advanced

224
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,320
secure code warrior

225
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,080
my friend created with a vendor a

226
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,000
customized course for the target

227
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,120
audience

228
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,120
that way they can see the relevance and

229
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,399
implement what they've learned

230
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,959
security is a team sport

231
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,880
so many of the security advocates and

232
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,040
security professionals drive security

233
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,200
activities and offer mentorship to

234
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,160
whoever seeks it

235
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,600
in conclusion

236
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,120
i'd like to leave you with the following

237
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,120
message

238
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,880
before you press a link you should stop

239
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,880
and think do i know the sender or is it

240
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,800
an offender do you open your accounts

241
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,640
almost every week you're increasing the

242
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,880
chance of information leak are security

243
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,959
training sometimes a drag splice them up

244
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,800
a little with capture the flag make

245
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,560
people more aware instead of writing

246
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,720
ransomware and don't be an attacker be

247
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,640
an ethical hacker

248
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,480
