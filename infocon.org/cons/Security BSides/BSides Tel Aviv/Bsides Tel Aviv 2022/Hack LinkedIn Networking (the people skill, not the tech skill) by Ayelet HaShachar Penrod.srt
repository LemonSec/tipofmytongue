5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,799
three years ago

6
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:14,160
in this right here in the city of tel

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,640
aviv i was laid off with more than half

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,720
the startup i was at now at the time i

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,199
was a relatively new immigrant no family

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,519
in the country and really

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,439
very few connections

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,760
not really a unique story here in israel

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,279
but it's not a fun one to say the least

14
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,320
months into the job hunt i came across a

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,399
man by the name of yol israel who was

16
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,160
showing how to use linkedin more

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,079
effectively

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,640
now if you're like me you probably think

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,719
of linkedin as a boring professional

20
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,120
platform for people in suits

21
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,280
or like i was at the time one more place

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,800
to throw up my resume in desperation

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,760
but what he taught me was that it

24
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,520
completely changed how i viewed my

25
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,640
career

26
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,840
and my networking

27
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,920
one thing i'm going to go back over here

28
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,479
to my notes

29
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,159
i went from having no connections

30
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,119
to my last two jobs coming from linkedin

31
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,600
not because of an easy fill application

32
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,119
but rather because of the connections

33
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,840
that i made

34
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,200
now i have connections to professionals

35
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,080
all across the globe these are amazing

36
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,360
individuals

37
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,439
that i have built relationships with

38
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,360
that i can reach out to for support

39
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,560
feedback

40
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,520
and

41
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,560
professional insights

42
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,560
one of them is my boss today

43
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,240
and i got the pleasure of meeting chris

44
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,840
in person

45
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,720
here at the here at the b-sides

46
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,200
what this taught me is the saying is

47
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,240
true

48
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,680
your network is your net worth

49
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,920
and in fact as a cyber professional you

50
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,719
already have the skills that you need to

51
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,439
strategically grow your network we just

52
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,439
need to reframe it for you in the

53
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,240
context of networking professionally on

54
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,600
linkedin so let's start

55
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,758
now like any good project you need to

56
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,360
determine your goals

57
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,640
there's a few things you can do on

58
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,720
linkedin but you need to be clear where

59
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,120
you are today so that you can act with

60
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,680
focus and intention because like jax

61
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,800
points out creating an effective network

62
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,440
is done through those those two things

63
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,680
so are you job hunting then you want to

64
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,440
look for people that have the role that

65
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,519
you are aspiring to and connect with

66
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,360
them but don't just stop there look for

67
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,920
the managers also of those roles

68
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,480
and additionally consider professionals

69
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,160
that work in collaboration with those

70
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,920
roles reach out connect to them and

71
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,080
build relationships

72
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,920
if you're looking to grow your skills

73
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,560
linkedin is full of an amazing cyber

74
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,879
community of people that are doing free

75
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,680
webinars podcasts trainings they

76
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,840
download free notes all the time they

77
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,319
have discord servers and mentorships

78
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,400
it's really great community so go and

79
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,159
check it out and don't forget to connect

80
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,319
with other learners because when we

81
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,159
teach someone else we learn even better

82
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,680
now

83
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,840
in looking at our target it's important

84
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,440
to note that we don't want to just grow

85
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,239
the size of our network you also want to

86
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,480
grow the diversity

87
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,280
network scientist ron burt performed a

88
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,159
serve

89
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,959
a study that's been repeated many times

90
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,519
and it shows that simply by having an

91
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,799
open network versus a closed one is the

92
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,000
best predictor of career success

93
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,599
what's a closed network

94
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,440
well it's basically like a pinball

95
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,040
machine right where everyone already

96
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,480
knows everybody

97
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,560
and you're just bouncing around within a

98
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,200
closed system an open network is one

99
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,000
that's full of clusters of professionals

100
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,920
and they're not directly connected but

101
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,920
you are the free agent that can connect

102
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,000
between them and as you see

103
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,400
opportunities thus making opportunities

104
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,920
for them as well it's a win-win

105
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,239
now to give an example for myself i've

106
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,480
kind of identified three broad

107
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,640
categories that i like to connect with i

108
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,159
have my cyber professionals such as

109
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,480
yourselves my fellow marketing peers and

110
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,560
then i have a hodgepodge of like small

111
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,560
business owners and entrepreneurs and

112
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,440
freelancers does this mean i never veer

113
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,639
from connecting to other people who

114
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,440
don't fall into that categories no

115
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,240
but

116
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,919
it helps me to stay focused and

117
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,919
intentional and reduce the noise in my

118
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,720
network so and hopefully hopefully also

119
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,040
the bots and the fake profiles we know

120
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,440
are there

121
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,919
so now we've defined our broad

122
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,520
categories of who we want to connect

123
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,479
with

124
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,479
you want to narrow it down because

125
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,240
i said we can do this in 10 minutes a

126
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,919
day right

127
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:46,720
so

128
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,160
what we're going to do

129
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,680
first off we're going to remember

130
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,360
linkedin is just like any other social

131
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,600
app it's designed to keep our attention

132
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,840
on the platform but you don't have time

133
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,960
for that

134
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,520
so how do we avoid the vortex of the

135
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,120
scrolling feed

136
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,360
we're going to identify just five

137
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,240
professionals inside our target audience

138
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,240
but not just any professionals

139
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,320
we want to look for professionals that i

140
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,960
like to call the the five mvps

141
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,840
the big three and the two little two

142
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,240
now what is the big three the big three

143
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,080
is going to be professionals that have a

144
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,720
large following approximately 10 000 or

145
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,520
more

146
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,880
but they don't just have a lot of

147
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,680
followers they're also going to have

148
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,039
and they're going to be actively posting

149
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,639
and they're going to be not just

150
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,880
re-sharing content but actually putting

151
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,280
forth their own unique feedback their

152
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,120
own professional insights their opinions

153
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,280
they're going to be thought leaders

154
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,560
but last we're going to look at one more

155
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,960
parameter for them to make the cut

156
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,520
they need to have an engaged audience i

157
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,800
don't mean they're just liking and

158
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,960
clapping but they're actually having

159
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,440
comments and conversation because in

160
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,440
total what these professionals are going

161
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,199
to be doing they drive conversation

162
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,960
because it's a conversation that you can

163
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,639
join

164
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,120
the small 2 is very similar except

165
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,160
they're just going to have a smaller

166
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,600
audience they might have a little bit

167
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,120
lower engagement but you're going to see

168
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,600
consistency

169
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,199
so now that we've identified our five

170
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,560
mvps

171
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,440
it's time to work smart not hard

172
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,440
we want to gain and maintain access so

173
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,160
basically first connect that's easy

174
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,280
usually

175
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,120
and then we want to engage them but

176
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,400
we've got it we want to keep it to 10

177
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,120
minutes because you're busy

178
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,800
so what we're going to do is my low tech

179
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,360
hack or no tech hack

180
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,560
basically you're going to open up the

181
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,479
professional profiles for each of your

182
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,960
five mvps you're going to scroll down to

183
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,360
the activity section and then open up

184
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,199
that view now i know this isn't a secret

185
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,000
to anybody who's done osint on linkedin

186
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,160
but for our purposes we want to change

187
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,680
the view so we want to actually go to

188
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,000
there we go we want it to

189
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,240
change to the posts now what this does

190
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,520
is it gives us a url directly to their

191
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,800
post feed

192
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,360
so i can bypass the scroll of the

193
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,400
linkedin feed i can go straight to each

194
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,639
of my professionals and see what the

195
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,240
latest conversation is that they've

196
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,080
started

197
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,840
then i'm just going to simply bookmark

198
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,160
the url put it in a bookmarks folder

199
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,120
every day commit to 10 minutes a day

200
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,080
five days a week for a month

201
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,360
and then

202
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,039
you know all you need to do then is

203
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,280
evaluate and adjust see what

204
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,759
conversations open up and see what new

205
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,360
professionals may have come across your

206
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,960
radar

207
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,199
now i call this talk hacking linkedin

208
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,759
networking but like most of the big

209
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,319
hacks it's a long game

210
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,840
after all you're building

211
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,960
relationships it's important for me to

212
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,160
stress here that linkedin is the tool

213
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,319
the people are not

214
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,400
what i've laid out for you is simply a

215
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,120
strategy for you to jump start your

216
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,039
networking

217
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,479
from there it's all about being a

218
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,639
digital and

219
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,319
almost got it chris almost got it don't

220
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,879

221
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,879
a human in a digital world thank you

222
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:07,919
ryan

223
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,759
consistently show up and enrich the

224
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,520
community

225
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,759
now in marketing we also have white hat

226
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,840
and black cat tactics but if you ask a

227
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,599
white hat marketer or sales person

228
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,280
they're going to tell you people buy

229
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,039
from people the same is true for

230
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,560
networking and the same is true for

231
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,080
getting hired

232
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,120
so be honest be authentic and be about

233
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,440
the people and you'll build an amazing

234
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,120
network

235
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,360

236
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,559

239
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,679
skills to reevaluate and apply them to

240
