countries so i like to have some fun

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,960
um so we go back to the beginning of the

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,239
ukrainian war

17
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,320
i was actually in ukraine for a very

18
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,440
specific reason part of my background is

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,079
nuclear cyber incidents i used to

20
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,320
lecture for gchq's

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,920
center for the protection of national

22
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,760
infrastructure so i've been to all of

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,760
the uh or i think all of the british

24
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,480
nuclear facilities both enrichment and

25
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,000
power plants

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,879
and i've handled about six nuclear cyber

27
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:03,920
incidents

28
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,560
and i was asked to uh go to ukraine in

29
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,880
case there was a nuclear cyber incident

30
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,400
and to stage

31
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,400
i ended up taking the last air france

32
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,680
flight to ukraine uh before you know

33
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,880
stuff

34
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,640
everything got closed

35
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,520
so

36
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,840
i myself woke up to shelling the rest of

37
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,759
the capital city did

38
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,200
and uh you know we're seeing

39
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,119
paratroopers coming in through from the

40
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,880
sky you know as you do

41
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,000
you know

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,079
uh they just blown up the airport and

43
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,799
uh we had decided to go a southern

44
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,439
journey because everyone was going west

45
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,119
towards poland you couldn't go east or

46
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,079
north because belarus or the russians

47
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,759
and um

48
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,200
because i know some very good people

49
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,920
because we decided to go south i asked

50
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,399
them to help out with intelligence

51
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,040
so this great guy dutch osint guy

52
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,600
ended up tracking me to the point where

53
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,360
the first city we went to take a break

54
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,600
in and he told me don't stop in that

55
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,479
city

56
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,360
bombing is imminent and we had a convoy

57
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,639
of 26 people and two vehicles sharply

58
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,760
turned right

59
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,920
and everyone heard

60
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,720
the

61
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,800
sound and boom

62
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,680
uh

63
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,840
a city with no military value had been

64
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,200
blown up

65
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,599
so uh open source intelligence gathering

66
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,360
and intelligence is very important when

67
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,280
you're trying to escape a war

68
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,760
let me tell you

69
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,519
so

70
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,480
it took days to uh actually get to

71
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,080
safety

72
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,360
and during

73
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,560
which

74
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,560
when i was trying to cross into romania

75
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,640
through the syria border crossing i

76
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,560
discovered what microsoft calls the

77
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,519
first

78
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,680
violation of the geneva convention via

79
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,360
malware

80
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,840
because there was a wiper virus that the

81
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,160
russians used against the border patrol

82
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,560
of ukraine and they couldn't verify

83
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,560
information couldn't verify if your

84
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,640
child was yours

85
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,680
and you're not going to leave your kid

86
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,080
behind all sorts of things like that so

87
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,400
if you saw the pictures of people with

88
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,800
kilometers and kilometers of traffic at

89
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,959
all of the border crossings that was

90
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,599
caused because uh the border patrol had

91
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,080
to go to pencil and paper and let one

92
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,800
car through at a time uh at the border

93
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,200
crossing i was at someone froze to death

94
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,440
waiting for to use the bathroom it was

95
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,799
very cold

96
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,599
so i finally get to romania

97
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,280
and i wake up

98
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,440
and in my hotel room i get this weird

99
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,440
message

100
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,680
saying hey chris you got out can you

101
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,319
help this guy named maurice creek it was

102
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,640
one of my special forces buddies from

103
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,239
the us

104
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,480
i have i'm not very good with names i'll

105
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,560
be honest with you and it turns out he

106
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,440
was a famous basketball player

107
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,840
and he was stuck in this place called

108
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,120
mikala

109
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,239
and mikala there is a river

110
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,480
a bridge and the russians were coming in

111
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,480
on the other side the ukrainians were

112
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,400
ready to blow the bridge for defensive

113
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,920
purposes if they circled around

114
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,560
and they closed off any water traffic so

115
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,439
of course he couldn't head east or north

116
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,959
and uh

117
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,000
via some of my intelligence friends they

118
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,880
had

119
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,079
told me to

120
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,560
very nicely inform maurice

121
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,479
don't put anything on social media right

122
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,240
now because some of the russian troops

123
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,960
are actually looking for high value

124
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,960
civilians to kidnap and ransom

125
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,680
so you know just your normal day

126
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,520
and

127
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,320
so

128
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,080
i started getting a lot of information

129
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,400
and contacting a lot of friends i think

130
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,880
i ended up uh hooking up to about 20

131
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,759
some different uh communications mediums

132
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,840
uh getting all sorts of stuff figuring

133
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,160
out drivers drivers from romania there

134
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,320
were some very very cool drivers that

135
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,160
were like we're just gonna go into

136
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,880
ukraine and start picking up people for

137
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,240
free

138
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,840
so there was a concerted effort but

139
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,000
trying to connect these people

140
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,160
and also in the case of mykola we had to

141
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,320
negotiate to get what's called a special

142
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,840
permit to try to go over the bridge

143
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,280
which they only allowed a couple of

144
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,720
hours a day to get maurice out

145
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,600
and luckily we were able to get maurice

146
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,639
out

147
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,840
and he was able to get in a car as

148
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,440
quickly as possible

149
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,479
go to

150
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,800
the moldovan border and then come to

151
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,440
bucharest where we celebrated by having

152
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,880
a lovely meal

153
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,520
so that was good

154
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,479
and

155
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,360
because of the publicity around this

156
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,479
this was from uh people magazine

157
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,120
a bunch of other orgs and ngos and so

158
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,199
forth contacted me going can you help

159
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,720
our people out

160
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,800
and i was like well

161
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,600
the answer is yes

162
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,440
so

163
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,319
ukraine for over a generation has been

164
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,840
known as high-value low-cost education

165
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,080
for a lot of the global south

166
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,240
and folks that just don't have money but

167
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,199
want to study aeronautics medicine

168
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,840
maritime stuff agriculture on a high

169
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,160
level computer science

170
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,720
it gives a lot of people opportunities

171
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,120
uh quite a few people who are educated

172
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,840
in ghana actually speak russian and or

173
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,240
ukrainian from back in the day because

174
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,720
they actually went to ukraine and went

175
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,880
to university

176
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,600
so i get contacted by this one group who

177
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,560
says

178
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,120
we have over a thousand students

179
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,960
in sumi ukraine

180
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,960
and to give you a bit of a picture

181
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,000
russia

182
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,120
sumi

183
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,440
and when the russians started moving in

184
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,680
within a couple of hours it was russian

185
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,240
controlled and here we have students

186
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,599
from india from all sorts of parts of

187
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,440
africa bangladesh asia you name it

188
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,199
and

189
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,160
this was a problem because when the area

190
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,639
started getting controlled by russia

191
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,199
supplies were starting to get restricted

192
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,280
uh the russians were trying to use this

193
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,759
restriction of supplies to force the

194
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,240
population to uh

195
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,360
vote

196
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,400
uh to be part of russia um we ran into

197
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,319
a warlord

198
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,560
um funny thing i had to send a message

199
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,120
to a former intel friend going i need to

200
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,599
negotiate with the warlord this morning

201
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,880
do you have any experience

202
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,560
so it was kind of an odd message for him

203
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,960
to wake up to

204
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,599
we had some humanitarian folks who said

205
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,440
they were humanitarians but found out

206
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,599
that they were actually smuggling lethal

207
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:42,479
arms

208
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,160
with people which would have put them in

209
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,919
a different category of the geneva

210
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,199
conventions

211
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,400
and some of them were like yeah we'll

212
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,639
bring food and medical supplies but you

213
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,560
have to know we're going to have weapons

214
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,639
we're like we can't have that

215
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,599
uh

216
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,599
it's just a no-go

217
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,520
we had a fake mayor

218
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,240
installed by the russians uh to get

219
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,680
supplies in

220
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,759
uh he said that we had to acknowledge

221
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,160
him so i ended up setting up

222
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,800
a fake website that looked like a media

223
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,599
thing

224
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,400
with robots.txt to keep it from getting

225
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,479
indexed and as soon as he saw that he

226
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,400
let humanitarian supplies in and then i

227
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,479
pulled it down

228
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,000
so these are some of the things that had

229
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,840
to be done

230
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,840
another issue was if they wanted to buy

231
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,919
supplies

232
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,599
they ended up being escorted by a

233
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,320
ukrainian officer which meant the person

234
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,159
buying supplies with this ukrainian

235
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,039
officer could be taken out by a russian

236
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,640
not awesome

237
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,479
um

238
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,719
some of the embassies

239
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,040
gave some terrible advice

240
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,680
uh when it came to technology this was a

241
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,959
problem because we were trying to keep

242
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,519
track of the students because well

243
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,320
um

244
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,399
some of the students were at danger of

245
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,399
being you know victim to various war

246
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,399
crimes then some of the governments were

247
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,560
just corrupt as hell we ran into one

248
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,120
particular ambassador from a particular

249
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,920
country in russia that basically got

250
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,560
paid to uh say oh yeah we want all of

251
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,080
our students in russia and the students

252
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,600
were like no they've been trying to kill

253
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,160
us we don't want to go to russia

254
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,040
um

255
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,959
we also ran into

256
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,959
bad water people were getting infections

257
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,959
people were getting sick so we ended up

258
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,000
uh

259
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,279
writing up a survival manual uh which we

260
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,120
crowdsourced a little bit from escape

261
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,880
students former special forces and

262
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,320
myself

263
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,920
and

264
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,519
um

265
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,279
when we tried to get them evacuated the

266
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,519
first time the russians decided oh we're

267
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,440
going to open a humanitarian corridor

268
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,360
they sent russian buses and say get on

269
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,120
the buses we're taking you to russia the

270
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,880
students are like no and they started

271
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,560
shooting on our students

272
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,519
luckily they were not killed like one in

273
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,279
uh kiev was killed when we finally got

274
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,160
a proper humanitarian corridor

275
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,080
we had buses in the front was the

276
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,080
romanian red cross and in the back with

277
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,320
this convoy of over a thousand students

278
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,399
and i get contacted that the russians

279
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,160
have just kidnapped

280
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,160
uh the red cross

281
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,640
and some of our buses they pushed them

282
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,920
into russia let the red cross come exit

283
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,760
russia and kept those students some as

284
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,519
young as 16.

285
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,040
uh and it's

286
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,600
then they try to stop the buses and try

287
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,720
to pull female students off of the buses

288
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,320
so imagine this is what i'm trying to

289
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,640
deal with and so are many people we need

290
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,240
to get them the hell out of there right

291
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,040
so

292
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,640
we finally get

293
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,200
uh the folks out of sumi and that was

294
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,399
very rough

295
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,279
um

296
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,880
there was a lot of them

297
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,120
so uh then we get contacted that in

298
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,320
kirsten

299
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,959
uh supposedly there's about 60 students

300
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,440
it ends up being 93

301
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,000
and turns out that

302
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,600
some of the

303
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,399
students had covet some did not but some

304
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,560
had various medical issues they could

305
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,800
not get medication they're facing some

306
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,560
of the same challenges

307
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,720
not being allowed to leave because the

308
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,399
russians wanted to keep everyone there

309
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,399
to force them to vote

310
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,120
to be part of russia

311
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,399
we had

312
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,240
one two particular folks where

313
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,800
they were uh a palestinian and an

314
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,519
israeli who are now best friends because

315
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,519
they had to live through this for weeks

316
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,560
uh the bomb shelter they were in the uh

317
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,000
top of the building had already been

318
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,680
destroyed but the electric was still in

319
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,040
the basement so that's what they were

320
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,200
living through

321
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,760
um one particular woman she was a

322
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,120
ukrainian

323
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,200
married to a student eight and a half

324
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,640
months pregnant severe asthma no inhaler

325
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,360
no access to a hospital

326
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,959
some of our other students when they

327
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,279
tried to

328
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,440
look for food and walk to a village they

329
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,200
were kidnapped by

330
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,760
russian soldiers

331
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,880
over zip tied brought to a torture room

332
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,600
um tortured and then put back into a

333
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,760
truck and pushed out

334
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,519
uh near the compound where the rest of

335
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,200
the students were staying

336
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,040
and uh you know all of this we're still

337
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,880
trying to arrange some sort of

338
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,639
humanitarian thing we're trying to

339
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,040
contact commercial companies

340
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,040
uh to actually see if they can extract

341
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,399
they're like well

342
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,639
i'll give you a discount for 150 000 but

343
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,600
i'm telling you if you got 92 93 people

344
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,120
from pregnant women all the way up to

345
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,360
70-year-old professor we're not going to

346
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,160
be able to extract them

347
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,079
then we had some

348
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,680
incredibly

349
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,839
terrible person who

350
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,920
had seen some of the social media videos

351
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,160
and contacted the student leader

352
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,519
and said

353
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,680
i work for the secret service we're

354
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,240
going to extract you give us all of your

355
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,079
contact information for all the students

356
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,079
in the gps locations

357
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,320
and it turns out he was not a federal

358
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,440
person

359
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,320
um

360
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,959
he was a fake preacher

361
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,920
uh who wanted to

362
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,160
contact all of them to read the bible to

363
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,920
them

364
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,959
and the students had packed up

365
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,360
and all of a sudden their dreams were

366
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,639
dashed

367
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,639
and some of them were suicidal because

368
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,800
of this so we had to kind of get them

369
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,360
out as quickly as possible right

370
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,519
uh so we're finally able to get them out

371
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,480
with arranging with romanian and local

372
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,560
drivers

373
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,800
the ukrainians had pushed back the

374
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,120
russian troops at the time and they used

375
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,519
that opportunity

376
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,399
i was asked should they go and i say you

377
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,560
know get the most vulnerable people in

378
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,680
the cars first but go

379
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,680
and that was i think about 3 a.m local

380
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,240
time leave now because they might not

381
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,760
have another chance

382
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,920
and so we routed them safe routes

383
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,720
figured out which bridges and

384
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,360
roads had been bombed out or land mined

385
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,199
to make sure that they didn't drive over

386
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,040
a landmine or if they had to go over a

387
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,600
bridge it was still there

388
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,839
and also

389
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,680
we correlated some of the information

390
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,560
with which border area was safest

391
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,360
because apparently some neo-nazi groups

392
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,440
decided to use the opportunity at some

393
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,519
of the border crossings to beat the hell

394
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,040
out of some of these international

395
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,240
students so we were not going to send

396
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,720
them into getting the hell beat out of

397
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,880
them right so we had to use heat maps

398
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,279
and things like that police reports and

399
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,680
so forth

400
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,040
so

401
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,160
lots of layers sometimes diplomacy

402
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,639
lots of coordination this is from

403
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,120
chimney

404
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,279
he actually is watching this he's one of

405
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,560
the students

406
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,199
and i was so happy that he was able to

407
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,880
get out as well as all of these students

408
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,320
i think in total about 1700

409
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,079
between the two

410
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,800
cities and it was very useful to use

411
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,959
open source intelligence and even closed

412
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,360
source intelligence because i was also

413
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,880
getting fed by

414
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,240
retired

415
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,880
former and active duty military from

416
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,480
various countries

417
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,399
trying to get these students out because

418
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,079
one of the dangers is if the russians

419
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,680
get a hold of

420
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,920
students from a particular country they

421
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,480
can then uh make sure that that

422
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,399
particular country goes

423
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,639
well we're gonna agree with the uh

424
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,240
russians especially if they came from

425
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,480
certain african countries because they

426
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,399
had their kids

427
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,839
imagine how that would look uh so

428
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,839
the risk of being used as a political

429
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,839
pawn

430
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,720
so

431
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,240
i ended up having to go to the press for

432
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,279
help because some of the embassies

433
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,440
were not great or giving really bad

434
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,959
advice

435
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,040
and could have gotten people killed if

436
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,320
they didn't already

437
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,920
and i ended up

438
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,480
from romania going to lisbon to do a

439
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,880
talk at a university and this chap named

440
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,680
gabriel was like hey let's talk let's

441
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,680
meet at this coffee house he didn't

442
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,360
realize it was right next to the russian

443
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,880
embassy

444
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,720
anyway it was not the most comfortable

445
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,880
spot for me we ended up talking for a

446
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,800
lot and he's like we got to get this out

447
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,279
and good tech advice as well

448
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,880
because some of these embassies are

449
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,320
going to kill people

450
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,880
uh so we decided to do that

451
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,839
and

452
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,079
so vice motherboard and a whole bunch of

453
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,040
people

454
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,279
uh ran some stories on it to try to get

455
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,040
the word out with also some of the news

456
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,199
about the technology so that

457
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,160
we could get more students out

458
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,720
before the war there were over 25 000

459
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,839
international students

460
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,360
now luckily there are almost none

461
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,839
but some of them are now in russia being

462
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,759
used as political pawns

463
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,279
uh some of our indian students for

464
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,199
example were pushed into russia we have

465
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,120
not heard from them again

466
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,800
so

467
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,399
i was able to

468
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,720
contact a lot of people

469
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,279
crowd source things like how to get food

470
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,639
and lock pick

471
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,880
food warehouses

472
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,240
um

473
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,920
a lot of the people i contacted were

474
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,120
people like you that i meet at

475
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,279
conferences so if you ever get a dm for

476
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,079
me going can you help with this

477
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,959
it's probably something like this

478
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,280
uh because

479
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,319
we as a community have unique skills

480
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,839
that we can use to save lives every

481
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,640
day so

482
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,559
wanted to give a shout out to dutch who

483
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,359
made sure all 26 of us survived karen

484
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,799
she's been wonderful

485
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,559
uh my now adopted ukrainian family misha

486
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,880

487
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,360
uh the journalists and everybody else

488
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,600
and all of you for listening thank you

[Applause]

491
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,400
i've got time for questions

492
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,679
yes

493
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,980
[Music]

494
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,559
uh so what i i talked about survival

495
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,280
skills intelligence and that i know a

496
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,120
lot of people my background is i was in

497
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,440
the air force i was one of the first

498
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,000
female air crew members that was allowed

499
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,919
to be in combat so i had to go through

500
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,840
something called sear training which is

501
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,559
survival evasion recovery and escape

502
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,360
uh pow mock-ups they beat the hell out

503
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,280
of you you got to jump

504
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,600
out of an airplane into the water you

505
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,360
know all sorts of things

506
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,240
um and because of that i know a lot of

507
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,039
people who are also in special forces

508
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,520
intelligence my second career was space

509
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,360
command dealing with what's called

510
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,679
command and control systems and also

511
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,320
protecting satellite telemetry data so i

512
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,000
worked a lot in

513
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,080
interesting fields

514
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,200
and so

515
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,000
it has helped me

516
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,480
with interesting people

517
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,320
that can help out in these types of

518
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,919
situations

519
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,480
so it's a great question

520
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,760
there's got to be more questions because

521
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,640
you have a bit of time

522
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,840
one back here

523
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,600
yeah what kept me going doing all this

524
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,679
and i'm actually still involved in a lot

525
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:30,640
of it

526
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,760
um

527
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,200
seeing

528
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,960
some of the things that had occurred

529
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,919
while

530
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,080
uh we were leaving we almost got killed

531
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,400
we almost got stopped uh but we blew

532
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,480
through the checkpoint of the the wagner

533
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,720
group or wagner group because they had

534
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,320
also secretly set up in certain

535
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,960
locations and we're dropping propaganda

536
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,039
i i do have a picture of the propaganda

537
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,960
dropping truck

538
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,000
um

539
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,880
and then when i got to the border

540
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,039
close enough where i could walk uh

541
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,520
because we had about a four more day

542
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,880
journey

543
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,360
um so misha and i walked up to the

544
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,480
border

545
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,120
and uh we were told about the cyber

546
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,760
attack he showed them my wiki page and

547
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,000
explained why i was there and when we

548
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,799
moved up to the most senior officer he's

549
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,120
like i have to check you out using a

550
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,559
landline because computers weren't

551
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,640
working came back

552
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,760
and said

553
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,679
uh you're on the high value target list

554
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,720
because one of my books that one um

555
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,400
i make fun of putin

556
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,120
um because i like doing that and hacking

557
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,480
things in russia

558
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,360
um

559
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,720
so

560
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,880
i got the refugee light experience

561
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,039
knowing that i got the refugee light

562
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,080
experience and only coming away with uh

563
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,120
let's see

564
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,600
a fractured tibia and ankle

565
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,360
out of the whole thing

566
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,320
um

567
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,840
i couldn't imagine

568
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,799
living

569
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,039
weeks in a bomb shelter

570
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,400
one of the things i had to put in the

571
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,799
survival manual was the

572
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,360
toilet tank water not the bowl was

573
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,360
actually safe to drink because that's

574
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,760
how desperate it was for clean water

575
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,520
and i couldn't imagine myself in that

576
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,400
situation or the situation of being a

577
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,240
woman and getting pulled out and

578
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,559
possibly tortured or raped

579
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:17,679
um

580
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,440
or anyone else

581
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,679
under those circumstances so that's what

582
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,440
has kept me going this entire

583
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,799

ah

620
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,639
uh in ukraine

621
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,159
interesting projects

622
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:11,200
oh

623
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,120
i do like to hack stuff

624
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,520
um

625
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,919
we do have um

626
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,360
let's see

627
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,960
a bit of an interesting project um

628
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,960
my institute the middle east institute

629
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,000
where i've have a fancy title

630
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,559
we were asked to write the abraham cyber

631
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,120
peace accord so the cyber addendum to

632
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,280
the abraham peace accords which is

633
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,559
supported by

634
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:37,520
israel

635
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,640
and uae

636
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,840
and we're trying to add to it the

637
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,159
support because i think that in this day

638
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,720
and age we've seen that cyber weaponry

639
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,520
can be used in malicious ways

640
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,840
i suppose i was telling someone earlier

641
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,240
i was supposed to go to burkino faso

642
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,120
earlier this year until um they had a

643
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,799
coup in the capital city and the reason

644
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,679
being is there's a particular islamist

645
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:04,960
terrorist group

646
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,919
um

647
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,200
that has purchased cyber weaponry from

648
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,039
iran

649
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,960
it's easier to

650
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,320
send them that

651
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,760
than it is to try to smuggle illegal

652
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,960
um

653
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,000
so

654
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,320
we need to realize or at least have our

655
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,400
countries realize

656
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,480
this is no longer fantasy or these

657
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,960
airplane novels or

658
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,200
you know funky movies with lots of

659
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,600
things that blow up

660
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,400
cyber warfare is being used along with

661
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,200
physical warfare and also all sorts of

662
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,559
surveillance

663
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,960
stealing of intellectual properties

664
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,960
trying to dox people

665
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,799
by foreign governments

666
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:50,000
uh like someone i know last year got put

667
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,200
on iranian uh news with his home address

668
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,679
and one picture of him and his dog from

669
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,760
social media who happens to be an

670
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,200
israeli

671
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,720
so these types of things can be used

672
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,919
against us

673
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,840
and it would uh be to a benefit

674
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,679
that

675
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,919
we try to look at what we do in those

676
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,000
situations

677
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,799
from the country level so that might be

678
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,760
an interesting project

679
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,400
any more questions

680
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,679
got a minute and a half

681
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,480
any questions

682
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,240
