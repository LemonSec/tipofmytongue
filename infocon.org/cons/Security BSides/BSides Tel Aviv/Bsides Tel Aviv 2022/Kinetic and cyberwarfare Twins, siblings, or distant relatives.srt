bit about this

22
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,239
hybrid war you know a term which existed

23
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,039
already like probably for 10 years while

24
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,079
not having a war and is actually for the

25
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,399
first time we actually have

26
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,239
the hybrid war even though it's in the

27
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,720
newspapers has been forever and we will

28
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,080
understand so there have been a large

29
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,520
anticipation so

30
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,080
um that um

31
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,479
cyber will have like one of the cardinal

32
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,479
or main role in this war and it's just

33
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,119
like did not happen so why and this is

34
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,520
what i will talk to you about

35
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,320
so

36
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,119
um

37
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,920
you know i left ukraine so i was born i

38
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,799
grew up and i spent all of my most of my

39
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,280
adult life in ukraine so when i left

40
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,680
ukraine in 2005 it became to me

41
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,600
painfully i became painfully aware of

42
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,439
the times the only one ukrainian on the

43
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,920
international scene so i felt like it

44
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,960
was always my maybe a role to explain

45
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,520
people who ukrainians are to be you know

46
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,680
like a good representative of this

47
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,079
nation and you know like you recognize a

48
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,320
t-shirt so when i was at the ccc camp in

49
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,119
2019 it was coincide with ukrainian

50
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,240
independence day so i've put my t-shirt

51
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,079
march through the camp and if you have

52
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,680
never been in the ccc camp it's

53
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,840
fantastic it's international it's really

54
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,960
fantastic

55
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,040
place to go it's whole week

56
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,880
so just to say like well this country

57
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,520
exists and then of course on the

58
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,879
uh february 24 the our life has changed

59
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,959
and i speak a little bit more like

60
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:15,920
uh

61
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,160
how i interacted with ukraine before and

62
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,840
during the war but

63
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,080
you know like um i just stopped even

64
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,080
putting my makeup because like day by

65
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,480
day i was just crying and actually the

66
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,879
first six days i was in such a shock i

67
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,720
did not sleep i did not

68
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,280
eat at all and in barr one of the

69
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,680
organizers of the event he told me like

70
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,599
marina you know what i really highly

71
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,440
recommend you to sleep and to eat i say

72
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,160
like

73
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,360
i'm fine he says you will craft no

74
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,599
and guess what like few days later i

75
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,920
just crashed terribly

76
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,879
so sometimes i often ask like somewhere

77
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,959
from where you are i am in ukraine so

78
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,519
that is like i circled it for you

79
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,599
and you know like normally you would not

80
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,800
even hear ever those names but now like

81
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,760
even the state secretary of the usa know

82
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,000
that exactly place why because two days

83
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,680
ago or three days ago russia has

84
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,159
launched a rocket on the shopping mall

85
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,280
uh and it's my native town and two of my

86
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,480
relatives one of my relatives like my

87
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,720
sister-in-law was on the parking lot as

88
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,879
it happened she was just heading toward

89
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,280
the shopping mall and my sister was

90
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,400
working in the office next to this mall

91
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,200
so

92
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,440
and as my sister was joking like well

93
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,560
that's a mall

94
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,239
where we bought your underwear before

95
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:32,959
you

96
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,000
uh got back to europe like for great now

97
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,159
the state secretary of the usa aware of

98
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,680
the shopping mall where i bought my last

99
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,599
pair of the underwear surrealistic

100
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,319
so um i always been working closely with

101
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,720
ukraine um so i left with then because

102
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,319
nothing was really much happening with

103
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,159
security in ukraine and then i returned

104
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,000
back to ukraine as security started

105
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,400
happening so i've been always having

106
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,319
strong ties with the government with the

107
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,080
industry with the private sector with

108
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,080
cyber security companies

109
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,560
and this year like i even like signed a

110
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,239
contract on them and a lot of

111
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,400
governmental projects where right now

112
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,159
ukraine is doing really a lot of

113
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,959
fantastic work in security and you know

114
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,200
like the war and the danger was already

115
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,639
in the air so

116
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,040
the organized science grids war where i

117
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,279
was allowed to participate as assistant

118
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,880
to the teams to help them to play

119
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,520
because uh grids war include hacking

120
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,479
critical industrial systems so it was

121
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,400
beautifully organized even

122
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,400
a lot of fun um

123
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,960
like really and um so one of the also

124
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,759
directions which i was leading is that

125
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,160
developing the national ot racial

126
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,880
security training so where i wanted to

127
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,479
work together with the phoenix contract

128
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,720
to create the lab stance and as you can

129
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,199
see you ukraine always wanted to be in

130
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,440
european union and just you know like

131
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,840
sometimes just like as a

132
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,080
affirmation like put a flag and maybe

133
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,479
someday it will happen and now it did so

134
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,160
this is what's like

135
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,320
i was planning to build such stands you

136
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,400
know like this is

137
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,160
people from whom i've been working in

138
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,080
ukraine it was before new year we are

139
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,039
all happy my family is happy we had a

140
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,720
lot of plans for 2000 for 2022.

141
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,479
it was all fun

142
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:17,759
and

143
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,400
i even left my pajama and my flip-flops

144
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,759
in ukraine because i was supposed to

145
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,240
return in january but then i could not

146
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,840
because already starting from the middle

147
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,120
of january

148
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,520
uh it was advised not to fly and

149
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,039
basically it was advice for everybody

150
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,360
who can leave ukraine to start leaving

151
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,919
like especially if you have foreign so

152
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,680
and then my sister started sending me

153
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,280
pictures as she is hiding from the bombs

154
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,600
so now let's

155
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,320
go back a little bit now to the

156
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,199
hybrid war warfare

157
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,039
yes no is it happening has it been

158
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,880
before is it something is it now a new

159
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,039
format is it old is it

160
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,360
like what it is and the problem is that

161
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,560
you know like

162
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,240
there is a lot of of course over hype as

163
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,800
my very good friend manuel artuc says

164
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,919
like this war is conducted on the ppts i

165
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,160
say it's conducted in the newspapers you

166
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,680
know like we overuse and abuse

167
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,840
wrong terms just to create a little bit

168
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,840
of more excitement consultants needs to

169
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,520
also create a little bit of fun and

170
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,440
danger you know so that they can

171
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,919
could sell consultancy services vendors

172
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,160
need to sell their appliances but the

173
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,440
very definition war is intense armed

174
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,680
conflict so anything that we've been

175
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,360
experiencing before you can call it

176
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,600
political crisis maybe even military

177
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,720
crisis but mostly political crisis

178
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,280
but it is no war by definition and this

179
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,720
is why everything what we've learned

180
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,960
before like any any events which was

181
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,560
happening in peaceful time it was

182
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,120
considered as

183
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,440
impactful and maybe unacceptable is

184
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,599
actually innocent and negligible in the

185
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,599
war and this is why we've got it

186
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,160
completely wrong about

187
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,319
how this hybrid warfare is actually

188
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,639
going to happen when it's really will be

189
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,120
uh happening as a military conflict with

190
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,560
all of those

191
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,720
components which belongs to the hybrid

192
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,960
warfare and again now if you look in the

193
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,120
definition of hybrid warfare it is a

194
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,080
military strategy so hybrid warfare is

195
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,160
simply not applicable to the peaceful

196
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,840
times

197
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,400
and then you know like so hybrid warfare

198
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,639
it has a lot of components political

199
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,160
diplomacy

200
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,160
influencing masses blah blah blah there

201
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,479
is a lot of components so cyber is just

202
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,080
one of them and the problem is also that

203
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,960
a majority like in in the past like in

204
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,759
the peaceful times we mostly when we

205
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,080
spoke about cyber warfare mostly people

206
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,919
were referencing two to information

207
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,639
warfare which is disinformation fake

208
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,840
information like fake news and so on but

209
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,440
information warfare is a completely

210
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,280
separate component it's not even cyber

211
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,520
warfare so in the past we completely

212
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,240
spoke about these terms wrongly we are

213
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,720
overestimating them and this is why

214
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,720
there was anticipation

215
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,000
uh about

216
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,160
role of cyber and cyber buffet in the

217
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,479
military conflict or in real hybrid

218
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,360
warfare was overestimated and what got

219
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,400
wrong

220
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,440
so you maybe think like well who is she

221
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,560
like

222
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,479
how she even can talk about this topic

223
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,639
what does she know about this so this is

224
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,039
about a little bit about myself so i'm

225
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,759
specializing about on the degradation

226
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,360
and destruction

227
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,280
of industrial or any basically

228
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,199
automation processes or physical

229
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,360
equipment by the means of cyber attacks

230
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,719
so what you know like about the

231
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,599
saboteurs in the um

232
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,279
normal like

233
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,839
regular army i do the same by the but by

234
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,360
the means of the cyber attack so it's

235
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,440
basically i'm specializing in offensive

236
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,920
side by physical security and as i was

237
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,160
preparing the slides i figured

238
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,920
apparently there is even a term for that

239
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,560
like cyborgs so i am a cyber terror

240
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,959
apparently and i have more than 10 years

241
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,760
in in this field so i'm probably can

242
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,160
call myself veteran so if you know like

243
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,480
there is a book of milk gladwell who

244
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,399
says like you become an expert if you

245
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,200
put into something like more than 10

246
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,120
10 000 hours so

247
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,080
in my field of work i probably put like

248
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,480
at least seven times more

249
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,399
so as i was like learning and

250
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,160
discovering this field and i was pretty

251
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,920
much as i started working in this field

252
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,839
i was almost pretty much hello nobody

253
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,760
been specializing on this so i've been

254
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,000
discovering a lot of different ways or

255
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,920
components like which exploits i need to

256
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,920
develop what is the difficulty

257
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,080
challenges hurdles and so on

258
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,600
it was extremely difficult because i

259
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,839
have to learn obtain a lot of knowledge

260
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,760
which are multidisciplinary

261
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,000
and basically so the point which i want

262
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,120
to leave you

263
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,200
like with this next this slide the next

264
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,080
slide is that development of cyber

265
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,399
physical exploits and i put in brackets

266
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,160
even high precision because typically we

267
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,480
have in mind what damage scenario we

268
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,839
want to cause

269
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,800
uh requires really significant of

270
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,800
amount of specialized knowledge and

271
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,399
skills

272
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,560
so um

273
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,880
as i was like working towards like

274
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,720
writing like individual exploits for

275
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,720
specific tasks i really came up with

276
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,040
this idea but i would like to execute

277
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,120
this cyber physical attract attack from

278
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,360
start to end like this is a chemical

279
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,240
plant i know nothing about it and at the

280
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,320
end i need something like a stuxnet a

281
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,920
payload

282
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,600
uh where

283
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,360
it it does

284
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,920
what i need with that chemical process

285
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,720
and if you remember stuxness was like

286
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,440
more than five like around seven years

287
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,440
to develop because then they kept it a

288
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,240
little bit uh before they deployed so

289
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,040
and

290
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,279
interestingly enough so i'm celebrating

291
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,600
seventh year uni anniversary of this

292
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,600
research even though like on the big

293
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,760
stage i presented at blackhead in the

294
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,240
same year i actually pioneered the talk

295
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,040
here at tel aviv seven years ago

296
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,360
at cyber week exactly basically seven

297
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,399
years ago

298
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,120
and so i presented this cyber physical

299
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,680
attack life cycle and it was like really

300
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,160
the first time ever anybody spoke about

301
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,920
exploitation like this

302
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,399
and i received a really giant like

303
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,640
feedback from like all kinds of people

304
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,720
from all over the world and

305
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,200
as i kept specializing in this field i a

306
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,680
little bit upgraded my cyber physical

307
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,360
attack life cycle i figured out that

308
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,800
these two stages

309
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,120
feedback and response i need to add them

310
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,600
because they're individual stages and i

311
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,760
don't know if anybody here a fan of

312
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,120
mainly an attack

313
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,120
attack life cycle and you think that

314
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,120
this looks like it

315
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,320
it does

316
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,839
and the reason i i've done it

317
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,720
intentionally because i wanted like i.t

318
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,800
security professionals to kind of feel a

319
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,560
little bit as if it is something

320
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,680
familiar just different stages

321
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,320
so this is my specialization and

322
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,360
so um as january came and it was really

323
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,360
became apparent that the war is going to

324
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,519
happen so the national security and

325
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,760
defense council of ukraine has asked me

326
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,600
to conduct a

327
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,800
cyber security training for all owners

328
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,560
for all people responsible for critical

329
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,639
infrastructure in the country

330
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,160
which was a difficult task because i

331
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,680
needed to put something together very

332
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,279
tactical but i also

333
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,120
have to teach this training online which

334
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,519
is again extremely difficult like

335
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,120
sitting all day long

336
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,120
and communicating just with your pc but

337
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,120
you know like we already all felt that

338
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,600
war is coming and um to be honest

339
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,519
atmosphere was like through that

340
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,920
computer i could literally feel every

341
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,240
heart and i had like heads of security

342
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,399
starting from railways national railways

343
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,360
to nuclear and everything in between

344
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,399
so

345
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,880
oops i did something wrong

346
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,800
right uh so yeah

347
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,480
basically

348
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,839
we've been really strategically

349
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,079
preparing to so that everybody of them

350
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,680
could understand which scenarios are

351
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,519
possible what risks their infrastructure

352
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,440
having can they quickly prepare for the

353
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,959
war what to anticipate and so on

354
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,000
and as the war started one of the first

355
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,560
tasks which i was asked to assist is

356
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,560
that like okay so we have a lot of

357
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,800
critical infrastructure like oil and gas

358
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,959
and power and whatnot like what

359
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,120
scenarios and i was given a giant list

360
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,120
of scenarios which was

361
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,440
let's say people in charge let's call

362
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,600
them that way were afraid that it could

363
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,200
happen to our infrastructures and they

364
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,959
wanted to anticipate shall we expect

365
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,120
this or happen or not how do they build

366
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,680
the rest of the strategies and as i was

367
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,519
going through that long list it's just

368
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,120
like no that's not possible that's not

369
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,560
possible there will be safety there will

370
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,160
be precautions that will take a lot of

371
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,399
time that is will probably they will be

372
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,160
able to execute in three months and for

373
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,920
us so as we were going through that list

374
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,079
it became apparent like we shall not be

375
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,800
even expecting uh any cyber attacks and

376
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,480
especially because

377
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,880
uh if you remember there have been those

378
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,240
giant waves of attack in 2015 and 16

379
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,839
where they've been executing russia was

380
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,160
in security like more than 2 000 attacks

381
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,800
like over the course of two months but

382
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,720
to execute that amount of volume of

383
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,639
attacks they've been preparing the whole

384
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,800
year because they need to penetrate or

385
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,480
get into the gigantic number of

386
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,320
infrastructures they need have

387
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,240
persistent foothold they need to be

388
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,760
there so that at the time when they

389
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,839
needed they will not be kicked out so it

390
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,440
takes a lot of time so obviously

391
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,839
especially after those attacks now a lot

392
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,519
of infrastructures are monitored so

393
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,279
we've seen nothing in the telemetry so

394
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,959
we knew that they don't have even that

395
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,560
excess so we have a very good

396
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,199
anticipation which was exactly right so

397
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,839
i predicted correctly that there will be

398
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,839
uh the infrastructure will be destroyed

399
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,760
physically and uh here this is where

400
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,920
it's important to understand like um

401
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,959
that

402
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,199
in general

403
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,199
you see again so just because in the

404
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:40,639
news of writer

405
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,880
when we find some piece of script of

406
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,440
malware which is maybe related to the ot

407
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,440
it's immediately predicted oh my god we

408
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,600
have like something like stuxnet and

409
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,440
tomorrow like i don't know blackout is

410
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,399
happening no first of all to begin with

411
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,240
even to deliver the payload you need

412
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,560
actually to reach the assets where you

413
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,160
need to deploy your payload and it's a

414
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,920
gigantic lengthy process to move

415
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,000
laterally those assets are so far away

416
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,160
on the network segment so like i bring

417
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,920
you here an example

418
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,600
on the case where i wasn't the incident

419
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,000
response and forensic the triton attack

420
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,320
on the middle east just to get to the

421
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,720
needed assets to the safety systems it

422
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,639
took the attacker 12 months not only

423
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,240
because it's a gigantic network which

424
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,760
you need to discover

425
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,360
and i'm sure this

426
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,519
this audience knows very well what i'm

427
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,600
talking about but also you need to stay

428
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,480
silent like you need to stay uh stealth

429
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,639
so that you will not be discovered so it

430
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,480
took them 12 months even to get to the

431
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,480
assets and then

432
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,480
even though like when i was doing the

433
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,720
forensic i could see the frustration of

434
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,320
the god of the guy he does not

435
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,160
understand why his exploit is not

436
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,120
working

437
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,759
he has like 100 percent expectation it

438
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,600
should it just does not and he's just

439
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,519
trying to make it and he was debugging

440
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:52,639
his

441
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,040
implant on the live controller

442
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,519
so and this is where uh

443
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,279
as you can see

444
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,399
uh

445
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,480
as he was debugging the payload so he

446
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,320
failed the plan so it went to shutdowns

447
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,000
eventually they were discovered so all

448
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,720
of that multi-month effort which is can

449
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,639
you imagine how expensive it is also to

450
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,639
keep those people busy it was just

451
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:13,759
simply

452
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,680
wasted

453
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,279
so um

454
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,759
and the point is also that even if you

455
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,279
successfully

456
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,639
uh

457
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,639
find the damage scenario which will

458
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,079
allow you to achieve maybe some

459
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,320
prolonged effect on the equipment and

460
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,360
you even successfully cyber executed

461
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,279
it's not necessarily that physics of the

462
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,199
process will allow you to achieve what

463
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,600
you want you can try

464
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,199
so if you remember they've been last

465
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,880
year i think it was a attack on the

466
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,680
water plant in florida the attacker just

467
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,399
got in just press couple of buttons on

468
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,120
the hmi game it was over hype oh my gosh

469
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,759
all the attackers can poison us no

470
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,079
that was absolutely new sense so i've

471
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,079
decided like to show like okay if you

472
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,680
really want to have like for example if

473
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,959
you take again

474
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,720
war in mind and you want to have a

475
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,599
prolonged uh disruption of the water

476
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,199
supply you really need some smart

477
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,959
scenario and the smartest scenario would

478
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,359
be of course you need to damage water

479
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,959
filters because without water filters

480
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,039
you can't produce the water so i really

481
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,720
wanted to implement the scenario i got

482
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,439
access to the realistic like complete

483
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,679
like one-to-one replica of the water

484
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,160
treatment facility and now i will just

485
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,760
jump through them

486
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,000
a lot of slides because you know the

487
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,760
whole network was of course complex it

488
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,360
took a lot of time blah blah blah blah

489
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,440
blah so if i jump it even in a

490
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,919
simplified form

491
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,880
uh and it is this is also presented in a

492
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,360
simplified form

493
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,039
eventually so

494
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:43,919
um

495
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,000
so filter is uh

496
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,679
get damaged if you

497
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:48,640
uh

498
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,039
reach the overpressure on the membrane

499
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,720
membrane of the

500
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,039
uh inside of the filter and the damage

501
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,200
is is happening if the

502
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,280
pressure is exceeding two bars

503
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,280
so it doesn't matter what you do as much

504
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,000
as you only if you use every possibility

505
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,120
to rise

506
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,559
pressure in that

507
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:07,520
with

508
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,760
a lot of tricks and gimmicks to raise

509
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,840
the pressure in that filter you still

510
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,960
the only

511
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,480
pressure which we were able to achieve

512
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,720
is was one bar which is not even nearly

513
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,960
enough to damage the filter so imagine

514
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,559
if the attacker is having this

515
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,320
anticipation there is a war they need to

516
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,640
interrupt water they maybe have already

517
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,320
persistent foothold they know exactly

518
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,160
what to do they've already studied the

519
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,240
control logic and everything the moment

520
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,120
has come they execute it like oops and

521
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,720
it's not damaging

522
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,200
so and this is the point that we still

523
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,480
did not learn

524
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,320
how to strategically sum

525
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,559
the reliability so they only can there

526
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,559
is no way for them to learn this

527
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,160
information what pressures they will be

528
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,480
able to achieve unless trying it on a

529
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,320
live process no documentation will tell

530
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,000
you if they try to

531
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,679
try to learn it on the live process

532
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,440
before the war or let's say before the

533
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,120
tactical moment

534
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,160
they run into risk to be discovered and

535
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,080
if they try to do this during their

536
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,000
tactical moment when they need it they

537
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,760
run into risks not to achieve effect

538
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,679
what they need

539
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,600
so here's the point so several points

540
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,360
which i want to just basically leave you

541
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,080
with is that

542
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,840
in the war when we talk about the

543
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,480
kinetic war we have strategy and tactics

544
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,000
we have very time

545
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,440
time constant you know like you

546
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,280
sometimes like make a decision in the

547
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,120
next five minutes you have you need to

548
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,679
uh you need to have an effect

549
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:28,640
so

550
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,120
cyber because of the lower reliability

551
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,600
because of the long time to execute

552
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,080
it does not work very well with those

553
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:41,280
expected uh needs in the normal like uh

554
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,520
kinetic warfare

555
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,760
and um

556
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,480
even if you try to like even if you will

557
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,160
be developing exploit for the same

558
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,320
industry let's say we take water and it

559
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,320
will be completely different uh water

560
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,480
facilities you need completely different

561
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,039
sets of engineers different sets of

562
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,200
exploits because there will be different

563
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,280
uh equipment different sensor signal

564
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,120
will have different noise and so on

565
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,240
tuning those exploits sometimes you know

566
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,799
simply to get processing of the sensor

567
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,320
noise and get

568
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,799
all the like parameterize your payload

569
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,520
sometimes i test up to two three months

570
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,320
and that is valid only for a specific

571
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,600
facility so time to delivery

572
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,200
time to execute for cyber um

573
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,440
let's say warfare or exploits is very

574
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,799
very long

575
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,400
and you can never know in advance

576
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,720
whether it will be successful or not too

577
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,320
many edge cases

578
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,000
and in addition the problem with the

579
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,640
cyber of course that it is one time use

580
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,880
weapon once you show how you

581
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,600
like a strategy how you ex like exploit

582
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,960
certain piece of equipment you can

583
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,679
protect it even if you try to execute an

584
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,240
attack for example in an energy sector

585
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,919
you know every facility in the energy

586
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,840
sector will start immediately threat

587
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,440
hunting they will try to

588
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,799
find them somebody in the networks

589
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,520
so

590
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,760
cyber so you basically really need to

591
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,320
use cyber sparsely and it's expensive to

592
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,559
develop such capabilities really

593
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,400
expensive in terms of it takes a lot of

594
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,320
time and a lot of people specialize

595
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,440
people

596
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,600
and actually um

597
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,520
during this armed conflict the

598
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,840
international institute of strategic

599
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,320
studies also published a paper where

600
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,440
they studied they actually studied the

601
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,440
knowledge what

602
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,080
different national state nations are

603
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,200
thinking

604
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,480
about cyber their cyber capabilities and

605
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,880
it is it's basically not the

606
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,080
even like

607
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,919
conclusions of the analyst but this is

608
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,080
what nation state think about their sub

609
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,159
capabilities and i highlighted you a

610
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,960
couple of words that at the moment they

611
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,720
still don't they don't have enough

612
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,799
knowledge about the strategic potential

613
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,880
of cyber weapons because they just don't

614
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,280
have enough knowledge

615
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,240
about their potential and just you know

616
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,840
like in the military you conduct a lot

617
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,600
of drills you continuously shoot the

618
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,320
bombs you study the radius time

619
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,559
impact of the air and so on in cyber we

620
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,679
just have not tried enough

621
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,320
so yes so what has happened at ukraine

622
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,840
eventually

623
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,240
very simple uh all the critical

624
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,120
infrastructure was destroyed physically

625
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,159
and especially they've been

626
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,400
looking so for example if

627
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,919
russia was especially interested in

628
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,080
specific region not like only destroyed

629
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,960
like all the let's say civilian housing

630
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,280
but they were specifically looking for

631
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,919
the like gas supply water supply

632
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,120
electricity a heat supply to destroy all

633
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,280
together in one district so that you

634
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,400
have a really full-fledged humanitarian

635
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,400
crisis so they've been always looking

636
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,840
for that

637
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,280
and um

638
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,039
of course like all the oil

639
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:55,039
infrastructure oil depose and

640
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,039
oil refineries were destroyed pretty

641
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,520
much at the beginning of the war

642
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,360
however like

643
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,360
we know how the rockets and bombs flies

644
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,960
you know the radius and everything you

645
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,280
still need coordinates so the only way

646
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,240
you still very much the uncertainty of

647
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,600
using the

648
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,240
kinetic weapon is you need coordinates

649
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,000
and especially if it is a small objects

650
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,799
like

651
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,799
you know like a small substation or a

652
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,840
small

653
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,600
um uh water treatment facility you

654
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,600
really need exact coordinates with like

655
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,280
decimals and so on and this is where

656
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,200
they heavily relied on the army of

657
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,520
saboteurs having on the ground some of

658
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,120
them they imported long time like

659
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,120
basically they sent or they sent from

660
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,960
russia recruited long time before the

661
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,840
war or the actively recruiting them even

662
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,840
right now and this is where russia did

663
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,520
not fail they made a lot of mistakes in

664
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,000
the war we all see them uh but this is

665
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,360
where the

666
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,440
where they really succeeded because they

667
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,520
really put a lot of effort is having a

668
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,720
very reliable very extensive army of

669
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,080
saboteurs which would help them

670
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,559
with coordinates and with reconnaissance

671
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,400
on the ground so they've been using a

672
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,760
lot of different marking methods and

673
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,000
even like

674
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,799
big small devices with beacon so that

675
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,760
the rocket could know where to fly

676
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,159
and maybe that quick i'm coming to the

677
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,039
end and one of the interesting um

678
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,320
maybe examples where that cyber does not

679
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,480
work and we need really physical

680
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,320
destruction is

681
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,960
railvol and bella russia so belarusian

682
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,720
partisans were really putting a lot of

683
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,039
effort too because russia was using

684
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,440
uh bella russia railway to actually get

685
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,600
equipment close to ukraine and because

686
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,640
ukraine and belarus has a gigantic uh

687
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,960
joint border

688
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,960
so they've been conducting a

689
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,720
large volumes of cyber attacks to

690
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,720
disrupt you know like support and

691
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,159
business processes you know like

692
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,039
scheduling all the wagons or locomotives

693
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,039
and so on but you know like okay yeah

694
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,400
the business process doesn't work

695
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,559
anymore you have to do manual work but

696
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,400
the rails are still there the signaling

697
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,000
equipment is still there the trains are

698
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,240
going it does not work

699
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,039
yes in the sight in a peaceful time

700
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,440
that annoyance would be really very

701
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,600
annoying in the military time nobody

702
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,000
cares we're still going so the next

703
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,520
stage which they tried to execute they

704
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,760
they started to do physical sabotage so

705
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,520
they basically started to

706
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,240
uh destroy and signal in equipment along

707
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,039
the railway and this is where

708
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,440
so that also actually did not help why

709
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,880
because well the railways uh now trains

710
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,840
can only go slowly they can't go fast

711
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,000
but they still can go so eventually what

712
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,159
has helped literally they have to

713
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,159
destroy physically the rails between two

714
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,240
countries and this is where this is also

715
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,840
interesting point that when we talk

716
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,799
about is its physical or cyber sabotage

717
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,200
in the in the war times

718
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,080
uh civilians you know like

719
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,400
is considered to be a legitimate target

720
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,720
for actually for physical destruction

721
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,320
and this is where civilian in a large

722
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,919
disadvantage compare it to military

723
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,360
because they don't have training so they

724
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,039
can't plan their operation they don't

725
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,120
know how to execute its celsius so

726
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,640
somebody else for example in this case

727
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,760
were caught and shooting the knees

728
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,559
and yes and actually uh

729
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,559
according to the italian manual of war

730
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,360
uh hackers if they are identified and

731
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,000
attributed they are legitimate target

732
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,720
for physical disruption as well

733
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,000
so yeah ukraine is actually eventually

734
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,600
switched and started doing the same

735
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,559
physical sabotage on the russian soil so

736
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,559
they started basically conducted similar

737
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,279
sabotage especially on the

738
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:39,919
oil related facilities in the russia and

739
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,760
one of the interesting scenarios was of

740
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,559
course

741
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,799
latest is usage of drone which you just

742
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,440
basically use some explosive

743
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,520
drive it into the facility that explodes

744
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,400
so uh i really need to speed up and uh

745
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,240
if anybody of you know this topic you

746
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,000
would probably remember well but there

747
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,919
was in destroyer too they've tried to

748
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,120
place it planted into the

749
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,520
one of the substations well it was

750
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,000
really super poor uh attempt firstly

751
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,640
they were discovered very early secondly

752
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,720
there was no smartness the only reason

753
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,520
why they've tried to execute the attack

754
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,279
because in that specific facility they

755
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,360
discovered that there was a

756
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,640
um

757
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,120
scada system which they used in the

758
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,399
previous case of the industrial one so

759
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,159
they just found something familiar they

760
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,240
just opportunistically tried to

761
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,640
use the same payload in that facility

762
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,159
they were discovered nothing has

763
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,880
happened it just was truly opportunistic

764
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,640
really nothing strategic or nothing

765
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,559
dangerous whatever newspapers are

766
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,559
writing

767
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,480
so and then maybe the last case which i

768
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,559
found extremely interesting is that how

769
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,640
digital data was evacuated before the

770
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,520
war

771
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,399
uh

772
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,720
because it was expected that uh there

773
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,760
will be a large volume of the attacks so

774
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,440
a lot of critical data was it was

775
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,360
decided like well let's upload them into

776
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,840
the cloud because we probably can uh

777
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,960
protect the data better uh but then oh

778
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,360
well but now somebody can drop a bomb on

779
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,600
our data center so

780
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,840
the servers from the data service needed

781
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,559
to be able created to save that data so

782
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,520
digital data have to be saved twice

783
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,399
so

784
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,480
answering the question in my title twin

785
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,320
siblings or distant relatives well i

786
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,919
think it's none of those they're

787
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,320
probably partners so cyber is a

788
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,080
supporting function and

789
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,320
it's only useful as this short term

790
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,840
tactical advantage like to gain of it

791
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,240
and yeah as a probably like hopefully

792
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,559
you got from this uh from my uh from my

793
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,399
presentation the tactical efficiency of

794
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,159
cyber warfare is still need to be

795
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,080
figured out thank you very much for your

796
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,080
attention

797
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:54,940
[Music]

798
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:58,140
