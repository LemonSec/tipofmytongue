[Music]

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,080
hi

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,040
i think

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,200
i think the most like effective like

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,279
strategies to shame all those walking

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:18,960
outside but i think it is too late for

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,320
that so

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,320
sucks for me um

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,880
good almost lunch time everyone uh here

12
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,960
at b-side instead of eve and welcome to

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,480
my talk ss oh no

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,800
yeah yeah you can clap hands yeah yeah

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,040
in this talk today you are going to see

16
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,879
all kinds of epic fails and

17
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,800
implementations of sso pages and mostly

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,520
learn what not to do if you have them if

19
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,280
you implement them

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,960
a lot of silly stuff which you should

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,520
actually avoid

22
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,000
so that's me that's a very quick talk

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,559
here it's 10 minutes so you can

24
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,000
postpone lunch a bit i'm not going to

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,840
speak about myself if you want

26
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,160
scan the qr code it is benign pinky

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,400
swear it's just like my linkedin profile

28
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,240
and you can learn about me and yeah

29
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,720
that's chewbacca and he's in every one

30
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,200
of my slides or sorry presentations

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,439
single sign-on before we speak about the

32
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,920
fails let's speak about sso

33
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,840
if in the past like decades ago

34
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,600
you need all kinds of passwords for

35
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,000
different apps and usernames

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,240
it starts to consolidate you have like a

37
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,759
few years later you have active

38
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,079
directory on-premise maybe and you all

39
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,840
use it in order to log into different

40
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,840
applications but in the last few years

41
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,880
you have cloud you have

42
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,640
all kinds of people working from home

43
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,000
remotely using vpn you can't

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,759
sustainably use

45
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,840
all these shenanigans you need a single

46
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,640
identity provider a single authority

47
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,720
single provider of tickets to any ride

48
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,040
in the theme park that anyone will know

49
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,399
and respect and that's basically sso i'm

50
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,079
not going to go into the technicalities

51
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,079
behind it it's not that interesting for

52
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,479
this scope of talk

53
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,159
and we're here not to speak about like

54
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,399
sso per se but about the fails

55
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,840
but first how it all came to be

56
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,160
well basically because i'm as lazy as

57
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,400
chewbacca which is also a star of the

58
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,800
slide

59
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,520
i use sso every day i log into a service

60
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,640
i need to type in azure for example my

61
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,560
full username at my employer's name

62
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,840
domain

63
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,080
my full name is long as you all know

64
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,160
right now so

65
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,000
it is kind of

66
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,400
i try to evade that so i realized that i

67
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,879
can type blah at employer name and still

68
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,959
being redirected it's not a bug it's a

69
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,200
feature the service is unaware of the

70
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,720
actual users used by the sso provider

71
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,120
it makes sense to some extent

72
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,680
and then was the classic what if

73
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,680
eureka moment of every one of these

74
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,959
talks

75
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,000
what if i instead of employer name.com i

76
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,159
put other domain

77
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,840
it's

78
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,080
it will still work like will it redirect

79
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,720
me to a different sso page of a

80
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,560
different company which i have no

81
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,000
affiliation with

82
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,680
you won't be surprised that the answer

83
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,560
is yes and it was like more of a welcome

84
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,080
to the jungle moment

85
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,519
than what if moment in some sense

86
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,599
because like what came up next is

87
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,080
i i've seen so many different classes of

88
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,599
misimplementations that said well

89
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,760
it is worth a talk maybe a quick talk

90
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,840
but a

91
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,319
talk and those classes are

92
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,958
as follows

93
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,120
exposing password reset

94
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,360
functionality in an ssl page because

95
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,440
yeah it makes a lot of sense

96
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,200
why shouldn't you be able to reset users

97
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,480
passwords from the internet

98
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,360
disclosing

99
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,599
partial or not partial email and phone

100
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,239
number information

101
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,080
listing in hundreds and hundreds of

102
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,040
internal assets and providing an

103
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,720
onboarding guide for anyone who wants to

104
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,640
join your organization maybe configure a

105
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,120
vpn device

106
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,439
out there in the internet in an sso

107
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,840
login page

108
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,839
and let's go to the fun examples because

109
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,918
that's like the fun part the the face

110
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:22,800
palm

111
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,040
part of their talk

112
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,280
that was the the first portal i've seen

113
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,199
and a change password button so i

114
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,080
clicked it and i almost immediately was

115
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,440
shocked that

116
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,479
i i got like a password reset

117
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,040
menu and it even explained me what's the

118
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,960
format of the active directory internal

119
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,120
username so all i need to do is go to

120
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,400
the to linkedin

121
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,160
and and find

122
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,600
one of the

123
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,080
like employees of the company to check

124
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,199
it out

125
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,960
use the format they explained and yeah i

126
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,280
was able to reset the password

127
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,720
you if if i had their mobile device or

128
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,680
email

129
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,160
account but on the other hand they did

130
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,199
provide me the email account and

131
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,479
almost not partial mobile number and you

132
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,000
can cross-reference it with a lot of

133
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,880
leaks

134
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,280
and it is quite easy to get the full

135
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,479
phone number

136
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,320
and remember

137
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,759
lapses maybe

138
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,000
from a few months back

139
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,080
they did thing called seam swapping

140
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,960
which basically means that they hijack

141
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,440
the phone number of their target and it

142
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,720
is not that trivial but it is definitely

143
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,039
a thing which is possible

144
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,120
and if you have the phone number and the

145
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,120
username and the capability to reset a

146
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,280
password from anywhere on elf with

147
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,120
connection to the internet it is a

148
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,360
serious threat and adding insult to

149
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,520
injury they misimplemented the capture

150
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,880
they had the different errors for a

151
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,199
capture username which are incorrect and

152
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,080
it was applied in the wrong order like

153
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,039
the test for what's wrong so

154
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,360
yeah

155
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,560
so okay so

156
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,400
i found all kinds of classes and i

157
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,400
in my essence i am

158
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,720
into austin and i found the google doc

159
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,240
really nice google door google docs for

160
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,759
those who don't know

161
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:12,639
are

162
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,360
google hack hacks kind of in a search

163
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,360
engine i found something which is not

164
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,680
this of course

165
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,919
which allowed me to find a lot of

166
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,919
like an entire class

167
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,039
of other issues we'll see in a second

168
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,039
using this doc i was able to find over 3

169
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,039
000 websites

170
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:31,759
who

171
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,840
looked as this

172
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,160
you were able to even log in to the

173
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,199
entire scope of whatever this company

174
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,400
provides

175
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,479
or you were able to login into specific

176
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:43,680
assets

177
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,160
using the sso service but the list of

178
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,479
assets was exposed in the internet

179
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,599
it had hundreds in some cases of assets

180
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,560
some named our very secret top

181
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,800
crypto project whatever

182
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,440
others were

183
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,960
internal like databases exposed they

184
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,360
weren't quite sure it will be

185
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,280
um this public nevertheless it's just

186
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,440
like you know an sap database

187
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,880
um some kind of an internal website

188
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,520
which was exposed for some odd reason

189
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,840
the very name of the asset was the

190
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,240
domain you could have accessed from the

191
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,160
internet

192
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,520
and

193
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,120
last but not least

194
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,720
this login page

195
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,800
i'm a chatty person so i've seen that

196
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,960
chat with it support button and i

197
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,000
clicked it immediately

198
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,080
but yeah i don't really want to chat

199
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,479
with it it's kind of embarrassing

200
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,440
i don't know how effective it will be so

201
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,720
i just like went to the i.t setup guide

202
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,319
that's strange why do you have an id

203
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,840
setup guide in sso page

204
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,560
and i found this way the guide to

205
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,400
onboard a new employee to the

206
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,479
organization including instructions

207
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,560
about how to configure a vpn device how

208
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,160
to configure all kinds of internal

209
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,319
software

210
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,840
things which shouldn't be out there in

211
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,240
the internet it makes my life as a

212
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,639
potential attacker way easier

213
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,319
and that's i think like the the bottom

214
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,560
line of everything here today

215
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,360
remember that sso login pages are public

216
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,720
by default

217
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,080
there's a lot of information being

218
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,080
exposed there which shouldn't be

219
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,400
it should look like this

220
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,520
and

221
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,599
you you do

222
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,240
might kind of find some sense in the

223
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,360
fact that you

224
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,879
should balance between

225
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,360
security and operational costs you do

226
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,958
need to on board new users for example

227
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,240
however

228
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,320
while that's true you don't need to do

229
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,559
it recklessly for example you can

230
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,720
install a certificate on the devices

231
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,160
which should communicate with this

232
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,120
portal

233
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,880
mutual tls

234
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,490
known as um

235
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:51,760
[Music]

236
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,519
and this will save a lot of like the

237
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,399
risk

238
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,200
of

239
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,880
you know

240
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,040
being capable to access

241
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,120
what you've seen here today from the

242
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,360
internet or in the case of exposing

243
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,040
hundreds of assets

244
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,120
by name out to the internet you can

245
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,360
expose the same list but for people who

246
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,120
already did some kind of a

247
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,440
form of identification in front of the

248
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,920
organization it shouldn't be pre

249
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,959
off

250
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,519
it makes no sense to me

251
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,519
and with this i think we can conclude

252
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,680
this very quick talk i hope you enjoyed

253
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,839
if you want to speak more about it hear

254
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,839
my contact details

255
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,360
and

256
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,590
that's it thank you
