events called security research

208
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,559
it all started 12 years ago in las vegas

209
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,959
when a bunch of hackers came together to

210
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,680
create the first community driven event

211
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,720
for the hackers and by the hackers today

212
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,959
there are hundreds of b-side tel aviv

213
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,120

214
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,959
