percent of you are newbies

170
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,039
welcome to b states tel aviv so what is

171
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,479
security b-size

172
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,120
well b-sides actually started far from

173
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,320
tel aviv all the way

174
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,520
in las vegas and it happened about 12

175
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,600
years ago a group of security

176
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,039
researchers and hackers

177
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,720
didn't really find their voice and their

178
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,240
place in the mainstream

179
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,720
conferences so they started a community

180
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,600
of their own

181
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,560
and that's how besides was born since

182
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,880
then b-sides became a global

183
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,520
phenomena look at that these are just

184
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,280
some of the b-sides around the world and

185
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,280
we are proud to be one of the most

186
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,840
uh prolific ones here in the middle east

187
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,360

188
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,960

361
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,959

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,040
keynote opening speaker i want to answer

375
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,800
a burning question i'm sure many of you

376
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,760
have had

377
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,120
why cyberpunk what is cyberpunk

378
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,200
why are we here under this theme of

379
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,240
cyberpunk

380
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,880
well other than being my personal genre

381
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,360
of

382
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,120
science fiction that's always inside

383
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,440
inspired me cyberpunk was something i

384
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,360
always thought would become a reality

385
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,480
this is a magazine from 1993

386
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,680
mondo magazine and in 1993 in order to

387
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,120
be a true cyberpunk

388
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,680
he needed to have cash money a gps

389
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,320
locator

390
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,880
and all of that gear now what would a

391
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,720
cyberpunk look like in

392
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,399
let's say 2077. oh that's right

393
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,959
he would look like keanu reeves or

394
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,959
johnny silverhand from the cyberpunk

395
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,000
video game

396
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,320
so for those unfamiliar with cyberpunk

397
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,480
it's a genre of science fiction which is

398
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,800
all about the combination of high-tech

399
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,920
and low-life the friction the edges the

400
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,720
underground

401
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,120
the way technological advancements

402
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,560
change humanity

403
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,440
but also challenge humanity and this

404
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,680
year right now we are experiencing it

405
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,160
cyberpunk is more reality than ever

406
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,040
before

407
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,639
one of the reasons i personally

408
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,639
connected with cyberpunk books like

409
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:51,760
neuromancer

410
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,880
which came out in 1982 is that the

411
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,079
heroes

412
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,760
were hackers before hackers were reality

413
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,680
they were already in science fiction

414
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,760
hackers fighting against

415
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,120
machines and this is what the poet who

416
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,399
brought us cyberpunk

417
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,240
has to say the future is already here

418
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,120
it is just not evenly distributed yet

419
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,000
this is the concept

420
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,760
of cyberpunk we are experiencing the

421
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,920
future in different ways and different

422
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,880
people

423
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,959
are actually going through challenges or

424
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,560
opportunities or even

425
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,600
enhancements in a different pace so

426
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,440
in order to invite our next speaker

427
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,040
who's going to really take you through

428
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,560
that cyberpunk future

429
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,040
i want to share a few words about him

430
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,880

431
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,000

he's my personal cyber safety hero and

433
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,240
he's going to talk to us

434
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,120
about why our cyberpunk future is here

435
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,120

436
