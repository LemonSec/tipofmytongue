17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,200
about cenaz's background sanaz

18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,960
grew up in iran as a jewish

19
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,200
person part of a jewish family and then

20
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,559
she moved with her family

21
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,239
to israel so she became iranian israeli

22
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,239
which is a complicated identity in of

23
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,640
itself cenaz spent many years

24
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,760
in the intelligence services and in 8200

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,000
serving israel and she has really

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,160
special stories to share with us today

27
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,079
from both perspectives of the

28
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,359
intelligence field

29
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,520
in fact she's going to talk to us about

30
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,479
the fog

31
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,760
of war and how state

32
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,080
sponsored attackers are using not just

33
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,280
cyber attacks

34
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,400
but also psychology and information

35
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,200
warfare

36
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,080
to influence people so this is the place

37
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,200
where information

38
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,240
operations meet cyber operations

39
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,600
and it meets all of us in our day to day

40
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,200
lives it's something that we all

41
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,960
actually have been exposed to it's what

42
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,119
the new battlefield looks like

43
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,240
and i think she is almost ready

44
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,040
and let's start by uh giving her a round

45
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,799
of applause to make sure

46
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,040
that she's got a good atmosphere good

47
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,000

80
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,560
about something not very s

81
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,400
like that you used to hear in these

82
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,000
sites it's not

83
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,400
that technical because i know that

84
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,560
you're a crowd of hackers

85
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,760
um but it's not also something very you

86
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,519
know spiritual and rochniky

87
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,920
and that stuff so i'm here to talk to

88
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,640
you in

89
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,200
about something in between i'm going to

90
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,640
tell you in the beginning

91
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,200
i don't have all the answers but i have

92
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,000
high

93
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,400
a lot of questions here the reversal the

94
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,560
reverser my reversal she just came in

95
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,360
which is good i feel very confident when

96
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,640
she's in the room

97
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,959
um what we are talking what we are going

98
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,000
to talk about is

99
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,680
the fog of war and diverse information

100
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,080
operation in modern warfare

101
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,599
why i choose that uh why i chose that

102
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,560
expression of war i i really hope

103
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,080
that you would understand at the end of

104
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,519
this presentation

105
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,560
and you know would be happy to hear you

106
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,000
hear about it so what we are going to

107
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,159
talk about is to be on the same page

108
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,879
to talk a little bit about terminology

109
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,720
and the spectrum of

110
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,879
influence operation because everybody

111
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,439
has a kind of other phrasing when it

112
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,879
comes

113
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,680
to influence operation then i talk about

114
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,080
very

115
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,839
briefly about why why we are

116
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,440
seeing more and more stuff like that um

117
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,639
we are going to dig in a little story to

118
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,479
to set the ambiance and to get into the

119
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,080
hardcore then real life examples

120
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,360
from our own neighborhood but also

121
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,240
from around the world which would

122
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,199
include

123
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,240
russia china and iran and maybe even

124
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,360
more

125
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,120
we talk just a minute about the future

126
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,880
or maybe about

127
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,800
not that future i don't believe in you

128
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,040
know prediction for the next year

129
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,000
i think you can see maybe two months in

130
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,680
the cyber world not that much and two

131
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,880
months is also

132
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,240
not very not very promised

133
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,960
uh then uh we would talk about what can

134
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,639
be done

135
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,120
and so any question we have you can you

136
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,479
know i think i can

137
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,039
handle that you can just shout it out

138
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:13,840
and we would

139
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,600
get it terminology this is also

140
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,000
a little bit new for me so when we talk

141
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,520
about coordinated

142
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,440
inauthentic behavior we talk about

143
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,759
um accounts in social media but also

144
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:30,720
others that

145
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,280
are having a suspicious behavior and

146
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,840
kind of conducting a certain message

147
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,199
not always with a content like retweets

148
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,720
right or likes so this is more like a

149
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,919
marketing

150
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,840
like legit marketing world and then we

151
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,919
have propaganda propaganda is not a very

152
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,199
new expression

153
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,280
there are years of years of propaganda

154
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,759
there are people talking about in

155
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,880
the bible it was talked but propangada

156
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,039
is already intentionally conducting a

157
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,639
certain message

158
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,280
then we get to this information what is

159
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,240
this information

160
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,000
is conducting that message using

161
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,520
what we call fake news so misinformation

162
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,199
this information would be the closest to

163
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,240
fake news

164
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,800
and what is misinformation

165
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,800
misinformation and sorry mom

166
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,720
this is exactly my mom does because

167
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,680
unintentionally she amplifies

168
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,479
false information right she doesn't have

169
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:29,680
really bad intention

170
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,240
but this is the period of people that

171
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,759
actually

172
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,560
continue to send that whatsapp message

173
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,199
uh

174
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,600
funny whatsapp messages it's the

175
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,759
misinformation and there was a lot of

176
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,680
misinformation also about kovit

177
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,120
right so the question would be what

178
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,919
is intentionally and what is the actor

179
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:50,479
actually

180
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,160
intended to message from here on

181
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,599
and what is unintentionally amplifies

182
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,240
like after shocks after the earthquake

183
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,840
the next one

184
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,160
is a graph we put together in pharah in

185
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,039
the end

186
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,639
um in order to a little bit simplify the

187
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,520
this complicated word uh because when

188
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,240
something is

189
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,960
so much complicated for us and this is a

190
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,960
problem that we actually see more and

191
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,039
more when it comes to this information

192
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,400
we try to escape right and

193
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,360
this one is a little bit to kind of show

194
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,120
you that we have

195
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,080
um misinformation and this information

196
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,240
on the left side which is much more

197
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,319
familiar to what we all know

198
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,360
right um the actor when he

199
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,280
already wants which goals he wants to

200
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,680
achieve he has so many platforms and

201
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,759
like 50 shades of this information that

202
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,280
he can choose from

203
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,280
and i tell you a secret most of the time

204
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,280
he used more than one

205
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,720
so getting to the left of this axis you

206
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,759
can see

207
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,039
more and more adopting and

208
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,879
but just playing the the game right

209
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,639
adapting to the social media and

210
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,240
understanding how social

211
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,280
media does and doing the right hashtag

212
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,199
and just be cool and tick-tock and all

213
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,479
the etc

214
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,039
getting to the right you can see it

215
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,080
comes

216
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,800
it becomes less and less legit and more

217
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,360
and more

218
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,840
cyber rrr right uh what does it mean

219
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,599
that you try to post

220
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,639
none um authentical

221
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,879
news and messages intentionally

222
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,039
sometimes you just you do it with the

223
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,799
your account that you just

224
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,719
put and there is a certain success you

225
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,039
can achieve but sometimes

226
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,440
you hack into the legit news site

227
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,600
just imagine tomorrow morning you just

228
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,160
wake up and you see

229
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,440
a very disturbing title in

230
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,480
i don't know why not it actually happens

231
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,440
every day

232
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,440
but it's our life right so um

233
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,360
the the next after that we call it

234
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,080
doxing what means that you hack

235
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,800
there is a whole cyber operation behind

236
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,200
this operation that you hack to a

237
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,240
certain

238
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,920
environment you take

239
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,839
all the secrets of the environment

240
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,519
sometimes you manipulate them and

241
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,560
sometimes you don't

242
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,120
sometimes you manipulate just a little

243
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,760
of them

244
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,760
and then you release hack and leak

245
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,839
what is the most famous event you know

246
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,519
2016 right

247
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,640
the um elections for us

248
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,279
the nc hack and hack and release and you

249
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:41,839
already

250
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,959
know that it was done by russians right

251
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,240
and the last one i actually um added it

252
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,120
just in the morning because i'm seeing

253
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,480
it just

254
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,000
during the the last months a month

255
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,440
one month is that when you do

256
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,120
that kind of a cyber warfare we

257
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,399
taught it's going to get done

258
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,360
like cyber physical explosions the

259
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,240
railways

260
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,320
stop going planes are clashing

261
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,839
but it's not just enough you convey the

262
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:18,240
message

263
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,040
to influence the opinion of public

264
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,120
sometimes in the enemy space in farsi

265
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,079
and sometimes in your space right in

266
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,079
other languages

267
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,240
so we have a combination here like we

268
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,399
have all the goods all together

269
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,839
at the last phase of this

270
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,000
axis if it's going to develop more than

271
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,120
that i think yes

272
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,040
if i can imagine what's going to be next

273
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,399
i prefer not so

274
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,160
let's go further why they do that first

275
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,000
easy asymmetric worm right sorry for the

276
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,800
language but when the bar is asymmetric

277
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,839
and then

278
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,680
both sides or three sides they are not

279
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,839
capable of the same stuff

280
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,880
when it comes to weapons

281
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,760
so you answer to you win the technology

282
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,079
by

283
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,959
other means so the way you conduct a

284
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,640
message the way you achieve the goals

285
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,360
can be

286
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,600
also conducted not by soft means right

287
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,279
by uh publications i just said thanks to

288
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,480
matan

289
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,079
from my theme i just heard a nasrallah

290
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,440
a brief i think three days ago

291
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,720
um which

292
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,079
was very surprising to me he says why

293
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,120
he thinks they won the second lebanon

294
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,399
war

295
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,240
with israel and he says this is

296
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,720
all because of the news and

297
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,200
communication and media

298
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,120
so everybody already knows that the

299
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,959
media is has the power

300
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,639
to change maybe the the real

301
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,519
if there is a real right the real uh

302
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,160
effects

303
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,160
of a certain um conflict

304
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,839
the next i want to call it a zero day

305
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,079
so there was

306
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,399
days that the people comes to me with

307
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,320
this information or

308
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,760
fake information operation and i was

309
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,519
said this is not cyber

310
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,720
the cyber i know coming out from an

311
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,000
elite unit

312
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,600
yes is using zero days it's a

313
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,480
non-click way of accessing your phone or

314
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,200
your

315
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,040
computer this is a zero day when it

316
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,560
comes

317
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,399
to the biggest vulnerability in society

318
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,160
these are human minds right this is the

319
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,519
most vulnerable

320
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:50,079
part of the conflict

321
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,160
in the time that you are you can be the

322
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,160
best in the front lines

323
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,240
right you have the best weapons and you

324
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,920
have the best

325
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,839
airplanes and you have the best

326
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,360
submarines

327
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,720
you can get affected in the home front

328
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,399
and this is exactly what they are trying

329
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,040
to do

330
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,600
i'm going to show you an example that

331
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,399
the most

332
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,519
strongest we get in the front lines and

333
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,440
against our enemies um

334
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,839
we are still very weak in our home front

335
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,000
so this is the zero day we're using and

336
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,720
the last one

337
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,480
is that it actually oppose a capability

338
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,240
for the actor for the operator for a

339
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,200
plausible

340
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,120
deniability because when it's good

341
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,040
they can say maybe it's us it's

342
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,399
ambiguous right

343
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,800
so it would serve a kind of difference

344
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,800
and when it's bad

345
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,000
it wasn't me right i i i

346
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,839
i remember the quote of putin

347
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,959

372
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,199
you know textile

373
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,519
factory maybe some textile factory

374
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,560
second

375
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,480
what is that tweet right apparently what

376
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,279
happens that

377
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,279
in a just in that article they actually

378
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,079
quoted

379
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,839
by mistake a tweet that was inauthentic

380
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,519
to it

381
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,040
a from israeli government

382
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,680
that threatened pakistan that if you

383
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,480

384
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,800
so be aware i have no clear bomb

385
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,079
very funny right but the tweet of the

386
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:45,839
minister of defense of pakistan

387
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,600
was actually real he was responding to

388
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,360
that anyways

389
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,480
thanks allah in this case or the god of

390
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,000

391
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,480
of israel understand that something bad

392
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,600
happened and

393
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,079
very fast they actually react to the

394
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,720
tree that it was all inauthentic

395
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,000
and none of it this is true what we

396
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,759
understand lately

397
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:12,320

okay don't look at this eye okay um

403
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:33,199
so later on back to the story

404
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,839
we attribute the whole network it's a

405
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,320
large large network in many languages i

406
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,800
saw it in arabic ho do hindu

407
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,000
um i saw it in farsi

408
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,959
and in english and we call it liberty

409
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,199
front press and we attribute

410
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,399
that network which is globally spread to

411
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:52,800
a

412
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,600
certain entity in iran you can call it

413
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,920
cover company but it's a company that we

414
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,560
call it

415
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,759
international union of virtual media oh

416
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,639
sas money said

417
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:09,039
why it's why it matters

418
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:13,839
after we do it facebook see our article

419
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,160
and they understand that it's kind of

420
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,199
whole

421
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,400
fake thing and they go very fast and

422
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:20,880
they

423
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,720
remove 652 pages

424
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,160
from facebook and some domains

425
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:33,440
so you see okay that article was in 2000

426
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,799
the seizing of the pages was in 2018

427
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,120
okay so you say okay that's it complete

428
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,799
admission completed

429
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,880
that organization already gone

430
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,559
this is i'm going back to the spot

431
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:55,160
a this is a 2020

432
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,160
2020 the

433
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,160
justice news the department of justice

434
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,919
in u.s they actually

435
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,039
publish that they seized

436
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,400
92 i believe right 92

437
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,039
uh different domains related to irgc i

438
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,320
can tell you

439
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,480
and there are maybe other um security

440
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,360
companies

441
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,480
in this room that they know that some of

442
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,640
the domains they were seized they are

443
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,360
still related to that organization

444
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:28,400
2016 2020

445
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,120
four years of operation not that much

446
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:31,919
cost

447
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,360
why they have to stop recent examples

448
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,399
do you recognize this

449
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,120
i'm hebrew is not my mother language as

450
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,240
a

451
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,960
current told but even for me it's kind

452
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,640
of weird even one of you tell me

453
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,840
how

454
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,080
this is not my report my company's

455
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,200
report this is a

456
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,280
fake reporter kind of non-benefit

457
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,679
organization i just found and they found

458
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:10,559
it

459
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,280
i like it because it's in hebrew a

460
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,240
network

461
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,160
of hebrew messages in in twitter

462
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,559
that they are trying to use do you

463
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,840
remember that right

464
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,320
place of the access that they are trying

465
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,080
to amplify and to

466
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,679
saw uncertainty and fear

467
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,880
in the israeli crowd

468
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,160
during the shomer khomot what is really

469
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,760
actually interesting the only thing is

470
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,280
interesting and it's also because of

471
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,400
matande told me

472
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,520
israel under attack

473
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,080
israel under attack was supposed to be

474
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,000
good for us right this is the hashtag we

475
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,280
used

476
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,880
they used it to show fear

477
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,760
who is going to be victim of this

478
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,120
messaging

479
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,240
you no it's my mom again

480
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,000
but when it's not that effective to

481
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,960
people that are

482
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,039
more understanding sometimes it's

483
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,960
effective to people that are not very

484
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,760
aware

485
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,320
also another thing i want to tell you

486
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,480
there is one thing that we can be very

487
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,120
proud of

488
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,520
us ourselves in israel i actually don't

489
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,000
know how it happens but it happens

490
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,280
we are not that sensitive

491
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,720
when it comes to inauthentic information

492
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,159
operation

493
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,679
like as a nation we discover it fast

494
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,440
i don't know how it happens maybe

495
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,280
because we are a small country we all

496
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,480
know each other

497
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,480
we are very nosy we try to understand

498
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,240
what is behind that name

499
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,360
we are a nosy nation what to do so we

500
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,080
are

501
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,320
even more immune than other countries i

502
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,559
saw um

503
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,480
this is the first but little by little

504
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,760
we are seeing that it's going

505
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,960
and actually getting more and more

506
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,840
intense

507
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,320
what does it mean but intense we are

508
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,440
observing

509
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,640
espionage actors like legit legit

510
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,400
espionage actors

511
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,840
um changing ttps and

512
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,559
getting into more and more information

513
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,000
operation

514
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,840
sphere how they do that

515
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,520
they actually hack news sites

516
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,320
recently i saw a new site is not that

517
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,159
big anymore they act they hack

518
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,320
academy sites and ngos and

519
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,240
think tanks and they post their own

520
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,440
content

521
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,760
sometimes they spoof email addresses

522
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,600
like they have the whole phishing stuff

523
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,600
they spoof emails

524
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,520
and on the name of yourself of others

525
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,039
i'm going to show an example

526
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:48,320
they would send an article to a certain

527
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,520
news

528
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,840
site in order to publish we saw them

529
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,880
published

530
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,480
and the last one i like because it's

531
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,159
closed kind of the circles

532
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,080
that information operation actually

533
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,320
amplifies backward

534
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,760
the cyber operation as well because that

535
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,120
leaked data

536
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,240
that inauthentic kind of documents

537
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,000
used as lures to further fishing and

538
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,400
what i told you the zero day

539
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,000
is that there yes right

540
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,200
right right okay maybe it

541
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:27,039
means something but i'm always left

542
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,640
ah okay thank you karen

543
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,799
meanwhile in our neighborhood who knows

544
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:33,840
that we have

545
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,240
um this outed war with iran

546
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,640
right so we said it's a cyber war they

547
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,360
try to

548
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,559
hack our water system

549
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,880
but it's not just cyber war it's in

550
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,840
every platform

551
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,159
it's in the sea it's in the air it's

552
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:51,120
with drones

553
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,919
right it's explosive you're hearing it

554
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,919
all over

555
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,039
but it's also in cyber

556
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,880
this is actually one of the naughty ones

557
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,919
i actually like

558
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,760
before we are going to the second one we

559
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,000
call it the impersonator

560
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,120
campaign like terminator what not

561
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,880
these two accounts you're seeing here

562
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,760
which is maria livengood

563
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,280
and she's a legit parliament

564
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,799
member of u.s the right wait

565
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,440
it depends on here the right one is the

566
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,080
real one

567
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,280
and the left one is the fake one um

568
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,520
do you see any difference

569
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,720
you're old enough to see

570
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,760
there is no difference the content is

571
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,000
the same

572
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,880
everything is the same the only thing

573
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,320
that is

574
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,279
different is the account itself right

575
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:59,039
for months iranis

576
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,840
iranian government impersonated real

577
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:07,760
people in governments or in political

578
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,039
groups they just got their

579
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,480
own post and they post it again

580
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,720
pictures of the children

581
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,279
um everything they like they use she

582
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,120
even talks about the receipt of the

583
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,640
certain food i don't know

584
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,960
something like that it's like everything

585
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,799
and little by little they start to

586
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:29,919
change a little bit

587
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,039
the messaging right

588
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,279
she started to talk about oh maybe she's

589
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,799
not that

590
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,720
happy with the recent israeli

591
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:45,360
decisions about iran and maybe

592
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,799
she thinks that

593
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:52,240
we are israel is not referring to a

594
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,279
palestine in a in a best way they can do

595
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,720
but kind of very little i like it it's

596
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,799
like a cosmetic stuff it's not

597
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,120
those information operations we saw like

598
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,960
hungry children and

599
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,600
and like anti-semitism and stuff this is

600
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,080
like a

601
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,440
art right they even change the picture

602
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,919
that she looks angry or she looks happy

603
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:16,400
with like deep fake

604
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,080
so this what when we discovered it when

605
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,840
uh she tried to send a letter to a

606
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,120
certain news

607
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,200
to be published that news actually

608
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,400
checked

609
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,080
the fact with us and we understand that

610
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,919
there is a whole network behind it

611
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,679
there is a whole network in many many

612
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:36,159
languages i saw even they

613
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,679
us there was also people in israel um

614
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,240
i even remember one name that they were

615
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,520
impersonated

616
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,200
next one it's getting closer

617
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,480
to what you all heard what was the

618
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,559
biggest news

619
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:55,600
in last year december 2020 when we were

620
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,559
all in

621
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,640
one of the lockdowns i i stopped

622
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,320
counting

623
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,520
sheer bit stuff right

624
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:08,000
a certain insurance company that is not

625
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,799
now much more famous than it was before

626
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:11,760
er

627
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,039
got hacked and

628
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,080
all the pii of all

629
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,279
of a lot of our friends thousands of

630
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,640
evidences was out

631
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,240
they were claiming that they are cyber

632
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,240
crime and they wanted money but they

633
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,440
didn't get the money

634
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,720
so they put it out

635
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:36,080
are they cyber crime

636
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,400
did they want money and they didn't get

637
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,640
it so i can tell you now by sure that

638
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,840
they are not cyber crime

639
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,000
there is certain iranian group that we

640
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,080
call them

641
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:48,720
2428. we know this group from

642
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,840
end of 2018.

643
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,159
how we know that group because the

644
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:57,919
investigation

645
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:02,159
actually continued and we started to get

646
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:03,840
some forensic evidence from that

647
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,200
investigation in

648
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,679
virustotal and other places and we saw

649
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,200
that those hash

650
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,960
hashes you can see and some of those

651
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,640
infrastructure

652
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,640
we already know them as a malware family

653
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,799
we call saltibore

654
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:26,080
this is a kind of pig i didn't know also

655
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,960
and it's actually very capable malware

656
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,640
and for years they are doing

657
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,799
also in israel espionage activity

658
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:38,320
very covered espionage activity so what

659
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,320
happened

660
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,559
that in december 2020 they started to

661
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,279
hack and leak

662
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,039
if it doesn't and a little later you

663
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,559
heard also about kls

664
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,760
another company got affected

665
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,520
um also i want to tell you that

666
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,120
we saw also not just that a few

667
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,240
linguistic evidences that we i

668
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,399
i couldn't know at the beginning that it

669
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:07,360
was like you know

670
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,720
persian guys and not very educated

671
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,440
try to talk like english to farsi and

672
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,799
first into english

673
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:18,399
you can see it here it's really funny um

674
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:22,240
we are still on our world this is

675
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,799
a team and this kind of world that you

676
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,720
don't have any parallel to that in other

677
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,679
languages

678
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,399
so i can tell you that it's a way of

679
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,240
this actor

680
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,279
somebody have to chain me here

681
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,840
okay just i'm going to be here and stay

682
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,880
like this

683
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,320
okay this is a way that this actor

684
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,760
started from covered con kind of

685
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,880
stuff to do it much more of it there is

686
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,720
always a possibility

687
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,520
like a chinese or north korean kind of

688
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,159
model

689
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,320
that they did want the money right i can

690
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,760
not completely say

691
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,640
that it was from government and stuff

692
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,840
but

693
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,159
from certain information we know that

694
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,000
they hacked other spaces we know they

695
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,120
had much more information to leak

696
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,360
than shear beats but they didn't leak

697
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,279
that so raise that information

698
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:24,640
they passed it to their commanders

699
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,320
next one pay to key

700
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,679
pay turkey or the recent variant networm

701
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:38,840
unique homemade like a persian carpet

702
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,840
ransomware

703
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,640
this we attribute to a certain group we

704
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,080
call it ankh

705
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,039
757

706
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,799
and 757 is a group

707
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:56,960
actually active from 2016. in 2016 they

708
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,480
hacked

709
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,640
as we know maybe they hacked more one

710
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,760
certain entity

711
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:07,760
in saudi arabia in 2017 they hacked

712
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,399
entities in saudi arabia and a little

713
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,640
bit more in u.s

714
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,000
just in 2020 they started to look at

715
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,799
israel as well

716
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,360
the whole hacking and the whole

717
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,159
operation

718
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,559
was espionage operation a very

719
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,159
aggressive way

720
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,640
of getting in we call it smash and grab

721
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,919
and take it out

722
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:32,640
right in i remember one of their hacks

723
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,120
in in 4th of july but in australia i

724
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:35,600
think they

725
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,279
didn't know that 4th of july is just in

726
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:38,960
u.s

727
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,399
that in 12 hours the terabytes of data

728
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:46,720
was exfiltrated out in the night right

729
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,320
um so they started to to appear here we

730
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:50,640
know

731
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,919
a lot of victims or potential victims

732
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,480
but we saw them for the first time that

733
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,880
their initial access was

734
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,080
uh from amital this is a third party

735
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,159
that had access to other stuff they

736
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,039
started to doxing high-profile targets

737
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,559
and if it's not enough they also really

738
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,880
wanted to look like cyber crime right

739
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,640
and they have this

740
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,760
twitter trolling like other ransomware

741
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,640
accounts

742
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,519
and they have this nice like the only

743
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,039
thing they they don't have here is like

744
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,399
a skeleton right

745
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,678
in the ransom note

746
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,159
is it espionage is it cyber crime

747
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,679
or is it for influencing the home front

748
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,440
of israel

749
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,200
during that cyber war that was outed

750
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,200
we can discuss here or other but there

751
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,279
was a certain moment i remember that i

752
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:48,480
understood

753
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,600
but maybe i'm mistaken that it is it

754
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,440
has to do with influence operation

755
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,519
we try to engage one of the actors

756
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:58,640
related to this

757
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,919
actor this actor also known as a fox

758
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,240
kitten i believe by other

759
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,360
security vendors um we

760
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,200
engage one of the actors and we try to

761
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,679
see what we can buy from him

762
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,000
and he was very certain that he's not

763
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,960
going to sell us

764
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,279
anything that is opposed to iran

765
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,679
interest

766
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,080
good hacker no anyway

767
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,360
let's move on we are getting closer

768
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:33,440
to the end a russia

769
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,919
russia information operation is not just

770
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:36,960
something new

771
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,039
that they just invented they are the

772
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:41,600
whole thing behind it like we all have

773
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,000
to learn

774
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,760
from russia it's in doctor line of

775
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,279
russia for years

776
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:48,880
um i'm not that good in history so

777
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,480
but for years you can see russia

778
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,559
conducting information operations with

779
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:53,600
media and

780
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,399
non-cyber one in the news and everything

781
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:57,279
but i wanna

782
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:00,320
mention one campaign that i'm actually

783
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,799
amazed by we call it ghostwriter

784
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,880
ghostwriter is a campaign not related to

785
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,399
our neighborhood

786
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:09,279
so it's much more fun to talk about

787
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,960
others problem

788
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,039
unlike the uh the two before

789
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:18,480
it's uh targeting a polling

790
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,919
poland um and other eastern europe

791
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,880
country ukraine poland um

792
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,640
i think it's also belarus and

793
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,080
other countries there which and it has

794
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:32,919
like

795
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:35,600
anti-nato messaging

796
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,279
and they use several spoofed emails and

797
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,360
accounts and they hack to the sites and

798
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:41,760
they

799
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,120
um publish

800
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,480
actually news that it's not right um

801
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,279
look at this one they actually

802
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,240
compromised

803
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,360
into the government of poland to for

804
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,279
officials

805
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:59,760
you know if the government of russia

806
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,919
have access to government of poland

807
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,080
i would say that is the you know the end

808
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,600
of the game

809
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,839
but not they would use that

810
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,639
access in order to publish on behalf of

811
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,239
that officials on behalf of the

812
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,199
officials

813
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:18,320
more and more messaging like

814
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,800
they even have a very nice sense of

815
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,918
humor like they are

816
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:24,560
publishing nothing that is related to

817
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,280
russia

818
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,679
they are trying to get them like fight

819
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:28,719
together like

820
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:32,399
poland interfering belarus

821
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,520
um which i don't know

822
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,239
when it's going to be end it's years of

823
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,199
conducting

824
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:42,079
uh things the last one i saw just i

825
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,040
think

826
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:47,359
in may this year look at this one here

827
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:50,159
they hacked to university they published

828
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,960
on behalf of university something

829
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,760
and here which is very cool we could

830
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,839
finally just in 2021

831
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:05,040
um attribute or

832
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,400
part of this group operation especially

833
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,920
when it comes to

834
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,440
infrastructure to a certain a hacking

835
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,160
group

836
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,720
that is related to russia that we call

837
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,640
it aung 1511

838
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,280
and 1511 is already a group that has

839
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,440
certain malwares that have a very

840
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,520
special attack life cycle they have a

841
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,720
way to get in

842
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,520
they have at least three family

843
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,040
malware's that we call them

844
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,240
you can see radio star and half shell

845
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:38,240
they are using but they also

846
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,040
do those hacking and then give it to

847
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,119
ghostwriter and then go straighter does

848
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,839
what they does

849
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,200
we do believe that this actor is related

850
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,839
to gru

851
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,359
here's the moment that we can see that

852
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:58,079
if you are still

853
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,400
safe

854
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:04,079
about gru there are at least two actors

855
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,599
that you should know about right this is

856
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,680
the sandworm team that on one side they

857
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,400
are been

858
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,280
really taking off electricity and doing

859
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:11,599
not

860
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:15,440
prettier stuff and then the other thing

861
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,480
like as a brick they do defensemen

862
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,640
on approximately 100 websites in georgia

863
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,720
with that picture this is the former

864
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,839
president of georgia

865
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,560
what they are trying to achieve who is

866
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,480
the audience

867
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,160
how they are going to measure themselves

868
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,640
if they were successful or not

869
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,040
how they are getting more budget for the

870
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,960
next year

871
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,880
i still don't know how it went because

872
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,960
and apt 28 i'm not going to talk about

873
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,920
it that much they

874
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,640
are the most responsible one for the dnc

875
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,839
democratic

876
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:52,880
uh um a group hack

877
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,960
in us china

878
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,760
i think china is very different

879
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:06,240
when it comes to information operation

880
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:11,040
um i chose to bring one example this is

881
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,480
the example i'm actually

882
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,880
exposing for the first time we haven't

883
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,920
talked about it and

884
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,000
probably we are going to talk about it

885
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,040
more next week

886
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:23,200
so stay tuned for the blog um

887
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,359
first we see a lot of chinese groups

888
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:32,880
that are targeting media

889
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,560
this is the amount of chinese group you

890
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,280
can see on the right

891
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,960
that are targeting in a portion

892
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,240
media why they target media because they

893
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,359
are the big brother they have to

894
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:46,480
understand what they are going to

895
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,720
publish but they also want access

896
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,000
in order to publish themselves stuff we

897
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,760
actually have a blog on that breaking

898
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,680
the news

899
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,240
operation target media so i invite you

900
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,520
to read about it

901
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,760
the next one i'm going to talk is a

902
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,359
certain actor that

903
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:06,560
is active in our neighborhood which is a

904
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,920
kind of evolution

905
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,000
of what we call apt-27

906
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,960
apd 27 uses a certain malware family

907
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,400
that we call focus fjord

908
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,960
i know it sounds like swiss but in

909
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,760
chinese

910
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,119
focus sphere focus field is a certain

911
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:27,680
malware

912
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,839
very complicated it's actually a first

913
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:31,839
stage but it has also second and third

914
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:33,200
stages

915
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,839
that when it gets to your environment it

916
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:37,200
looks for the

917
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,800
um most important servers

918
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,599
and then it install itself in the hard

919
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:44,720
disk and then it

920
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,160
delete is the c to other components from

921
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,599
the hard disk and it

922
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,720
actually um

923
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,480
encrypt it in a registry

924
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,280
this is the registry key on the left you

925
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,280
can see the value

926
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,119
on the right you can see what actually

927
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,200
means right so most of the variants we

928
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,040
were looking at

929
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,079
thank you staff is

930
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,920
a actually one two three right

931
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,880
one is the executable and as you can see

932
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,839
eight

933
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:23,040
is c2 like we understand after reversing

934
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,079
it this is why it hangs

935
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:25,920
off because she reversed it we

936
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,000
understand what stand

937
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,440
these numbers stand for on the right

938
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,400
you can see the same malware the same

939
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,119
registry values

940
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:40,400
in farsi deracht

941
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,040
dal host

942
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,400
like what does it mean it's not even

943
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,040
close

944
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,359
to the name or to the what the value

945
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:58,480
actually means

946
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,480
by why is it why it is in farsi

947
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,119
why not why not because they could do

948
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:08,240
one two three we see a lot of stuff

949
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,680
false flag rare where used they used

950
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,160
farsi

951
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,920
in israel

952
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,839
they used farsi first flag in first in

953
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:24,720
israel

954
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,839
also in uzbekistan

955
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:31,040
you can see more variants of the same

956
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,599
factor

957
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:39,839
english farsi hindi

958
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,240
this misinformation this information

959
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:52,000
is embedded in the code

960
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,319
does it mean this is the only value in

961
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:56,400
their marvel that is not encrypted

962
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,440
because we heard so many curse

963
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,119
from yuri and estovia reversing the

964
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:03,200
vulva because it's hard to reverse it

965
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,119
but then we have these values that are

966
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:06,400
not encrypted so

967
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,920
imagine that they got caught or

968
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,480
something not really okay

969
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,400
you get to do forensic there are people

970
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,560
to forensic i'm not a forensic lady

971
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,400
and you don't get that the first thing

972
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,920
you can see is the values

973
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,079
even if you put it in the sandbox this i

974
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:21,599
know to do without the

975
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:23,760
thing you can see the values in farsi

976
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,880
and in hindi

977
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,520
what do you think

978
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:32,319
iranians again what's new

979
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:34,160
iranians hitting our critical

980
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,759
infrastructure what's new

981
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,839
we are in a lot of

982
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:47,200
contracts with china

983
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:51,359
and business and economic relations

984
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:54,960
so it's just a kind of

985
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,319
safe way to blame or try to blame iran

986
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:01,680
but what is funny i'm just going back

987
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,800
last time to the far sitting that far

988
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,400
see the farsi speakers in the room how

989
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,839
many are there

990
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:10,880
here just one thing throughout ah here's

991
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,920
another one

992
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,960
that force is a dictionary farsi

993
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:19,119
is not a farsi that hackers use

994
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,760
just imagine a hacker talk in a very

995
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,800
polite way

996
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,119
right

997
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,520
i showed you the ang-757 with the

998
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,280
pay-to-key stuff

999
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,680
full of persian curse even the handles

1000
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,119
uh in darkware

1001
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,200
darknet there were so many bad words in

1002
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,319
farsi that actually felt like

1003
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:44,960
embarrassed to investigate that to

1004
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,040
investigate that and here you can see oh

1005
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,520
nice for us this is my father's parsy

1006
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,560
okay

1007
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,560
uh so you can see they tried it's not

1008
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,760
very sophisticated

1009
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,520
but it would show the immediate suspect

1010
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,720
right

1011
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:02,800
as i run embedded in the code

1012
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,359
what now

1013
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:08,720
what is this

1014
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:17,440
do you know what is this nobody saw that

1015
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:23,200
the yes right it's something about

1016
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,280
ministry ministry of transportation in

1017
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,839
iran

1018
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,440
the date that i did a very

1019
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,640
nice yellow line i'm very famous with my

1020
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:38,560
not direct yellow lines down there

1021
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:42,200

1032
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:18,800
translate it

1033
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,000
this is a phrase pizzgam right in farsi

1034

that there is just in fuzzy and it means

1035
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:25,359

1039
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,200
everything in farsi is related to some

1040
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,560
carpet um

1041
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:45,599

1045
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,560
going to achieve

1046
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:02,640
this is the future of cyber

1047
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:06,560
hacks information is it effective

1048
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,599
probably yes there are

1049
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:13,520
a lot of propaganda

1050
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:19,839
now in iran and strikes in just a second

1051
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:26,480
now what i showed you a lot of examples

1052
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:30,640
somewhere very

1053
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,599
kind of into ethic he could see like it

1054
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:35,200
everywhere like everybody's talking

1055
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,960
about it and some were embedded in the

1056
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:37,599
code

1057
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:39,760
and some were embedded in somebody's

1058
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,000
computer

1059
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,599
they are everywhere this is

1060
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:50,160
a fog of war this is a war

1061
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,560
or this is our life if it's everywhere

1062
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,839
it's already war

1063
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:56,720
this is going to be our life we are not

1064
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,240
a lot of this information and

1065
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,240
information operation also about covet

1066
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,440
right

1067
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,960
this is everywhere so

1068
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:09,119
if it's that usual we are still going to

1069
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:12,400
use it the terminology as a warfare

1070
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,720
or something else i don't have the

1071
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:15,520
answer i

1072
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:19,759
know that i think there are red lines

1073
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,720
like everything in the world if there is

1074
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,160
a red line

1075
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,920
i'm not bb with the you know the red

1076
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,079
line to show you where is that red line

1077
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:37,119
where is that lead time so i do believe

1078
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:39,520
also that even if you want to stop it i

1079
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,240
showed you like lots of seizing domains

1080
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,200
and

1081
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:46,800
closing accounts and you know no no no

1082
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:51,119
stuff the day after they are going to do

1083
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:52,560
it again

1084
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,440
what is the real cost you can take from

1085
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,280
the operators

1086
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,920
but maybe also it's a kind of clean kind

1087
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,599
of war i like it right

1088
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:05,520
no soldiers get hurt

1089
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:11,200
what can be done so for the good people

1090
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,400
that in between like my mom right

1091
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,319
that i don't want them to get affected

1092
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:17,760
by by uh

1093
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,480
fake news i would say there would be

1094
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,760
maybe three

1095
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,839
best practices i saw during the last

1096
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:26,319
year the first communication

1097
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:29,520
you win information operation

1098
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:32,640
by bringing the right information to the

1099
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,079
right people

1100
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:39,119
on the right media at the right time

1101
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:41,520
don't hide stuff just talk about it

1102
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,280
right we are we saw

1103
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,680
a very actually successful i believe

1104
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,720
campaign in usd us during the last

1105
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,440
the last elections four generals from

1106
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:52,559
four organizations

1107
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:55,760
all together talking to the crowd in the

1108
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:56,480
tv

1109
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,000
right no hacking everything is safe

1110
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,480
don't worry there is no fake news or

1111
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,720
there was the proud boys there was like

1112
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:05,200
um

1113
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,680
iranian group tried to do misinformation

1114
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,839
calling people in u.s if you go

1115
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:13,680
vote for trump we are going to beat you

1116
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,520
people actually was afraid they're going

1117
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,119
out to the news and saying

1118
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:19,599
ah they can do nothing to you this is

1119
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:21,839
fake

1120
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,520
communication communication

1121
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:24,300
communication

1122
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:25,920
[Music]

1123
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,760
ladies are better than men in this world

1124
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,160
i'm sorry to tell that so i really

1125
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,079
believe that we have to enhance

1126
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:37,200
communication around it the second one

1127
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,960
i just heard that biden was a blaming

1128
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:45,119
facebook right about

1129
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:47,599
why the vaccination was not as

1130
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:49,440
successful that he wanted because there

1131
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,240
was a lot of misinformation

1132
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,240
posted by facebook accounts did you

1133
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,119
heard have you heard about it

1134
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:59,839
i was like by then he's the president of

1135
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:00,720
the biggest

1136
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,839
democratic company i know he is talking

1137
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:05,599
to facebook

1138
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:08,960
okay what does it mean that facebook has

1139
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,160
the power

1140
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:14,079
now at least like the president of u.s

1141
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:16,800
so there is responsibility has to be

1142
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:17,760
taken

1143
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,280
by these platforms they are

1144
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,520
doing a lot of good to the world

1145
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,040
bringing us technology

1146
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,280
and bringing us communication everywhere

1147
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,480
and we are not

1148
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:31,599
you know in dependent to one or two

1149
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:32,800
channels

1150
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,200
but they still have the responsibility

1151
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,640
to check the facts and to

1152
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:41,440
continuously look for inauthentic

1153
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,319
behavior

1154
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:44,880
the last one is education i heard i

1155
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,559
don't know for sure that it's right that

1156
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:48,400
i heard in finland from the second or

1157
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,319
the third grade they learned in the

1158
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:54,160
school primary school to ask questions

1159
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:58,240
about information they see in internet

1160
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:01,040
i don't know if it's right i prefer to

1161
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,280
imagine that is right

1162
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,200
and i think it's going to correct itself

1163
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,400
because i have

1164
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,920
two boys nine and six and they are much

1165
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,040
more aware than

1166
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:15,760
me when it comes to internet information

1167
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:19,839
they look at something ah it's not

1168
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:21,920
sometimes they're looking at really

1169
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,760
serious stuff in the news because i'm

1170
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,839
seeing news when they are still awake

1171
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:26,240
and

1172
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,599
ah it's a fake right mom yes fake fake

1173
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:31,440
don't believe everything you see

1174
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,680
so i believe that it's going to kind of

1175
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,760
correct itself and people

1176
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,720
because they are living in this room in

1177
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,640
this world that is

1178
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,559
many challenge the channels and

1179
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,559
platforms of information

1180
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:48,240
they would have to learn how to conduct

1181
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,359
and how to decide which information is

1182
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:52,839
right and which is

1183
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:55,839
not

1184
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:59,359
us being mostly analysts this is what

1185
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:00,319
they

1186
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:02,640
teach us right in the units how to

1187
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,559
