151
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,240
this year has been a challenging year

152
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,759
for all of us it's been a challenging

153
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:24,560
year for me

154
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,840
i don't know if you know this but i'm

155
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,840
wearing these very special shoes that

156
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,600
have actually allowed me to jump around

157
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,560
on this stage

158
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,720
and you wouldn't believe it but before i

159
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,720
had these shoes i wasn't able to walk

160
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,080
around so well

161
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,240
it's because i actually did too much

162
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,000
yoga believe it or not

163
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,360

164
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,840
presentation about doing too much yoga

165
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,360

222

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,280
someone else so let's begin

226
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,800
um i want to enable csp on my website so

227
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,639
what the hell do i need to do

228
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,240
i need to read and understand the

229
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,240
meaning of all the directives

230
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,520
does anybody know all the directives

231
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,639
no any anybody no okay i need to

232
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,080
add yep i need to add the headers with

233
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,199
the report only

234
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,520
why would i only want to report and not

235
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,520
to enforce

236
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,000
anybody no okay

237
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,479
enforcing is for geeks

238
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,929
enforcing is for nerds um

239
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:43,599
[Music]

240
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,920
all right and then i had no issues on my

241
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,920
website so everything is great

242
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,200
so said nobody ever um

243
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,839
later that year

244
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,279
okay they got a call

245
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,680
about their website reporting a bunch of

246
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,320
stuff

247
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,680
and they needed to really understand

248
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,440
what's going on there because csp

249
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,959
is is a mess so what is really what

250
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:11,519
really is

251
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,160
csp so it's a content security policy

252
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,000
and it's an added security layer that

253
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,640
helps you

254
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,160
detect and understand what's happening

255
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,160
with with xss and

256
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,200
is our speaker anywhere near coming

257
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,320
anytime soon

258
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,440
no okay um it was introduced in

259
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,720
um uh 2004 in firefox and then

260
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:37,839
wc3 who knows what w3c stands for

261
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,800
no no that's not correct anybody else

262
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,320
not the world wrestling federation

263
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,120
anybody else

264
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,360
w3c any guesses

265
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,200
world world something

266
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,560
what bathrooms wc

267
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,240
is does stand for bathrooms but that's

268
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,120
not it but the final version

269
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,680
was in 2016 and then there's another

270
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,360
working progress version

271
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,839
because final is never final it's like

272
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,079
powerpoint karaoke it never ends

273
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,240
so how does it really work there's a

274
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,920
header that tells you

275
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,399
um the source and the destination

276
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,240
why are you talking to me in my ear when

277
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,279
i'm trying to present

278
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,800
um i'm going to get rid of this um

279
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,640
so there's a header that you need to to

280
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,040
maintain and then it tells you when

281
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,000
something fake

282
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,079
is going on can anybody just take the

283
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,959
fake script

284
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,480
which one is the fake any guesses

285
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,760
yes which one is the fake the one that

286
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,480
is fake

287
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,560
good you get an award

288
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,680
xiaomi no

289
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,360
all right you don't get an award all

290
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,760
right sucks to be you

291
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,959
you were right you were right you were

292
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,800
absolutely right but you don't get an

293
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,200
award

294
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,079
i was lying yes questions from the

295
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,479
audience

296
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,760
how much energy did it you know at one

297
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,880
point i tried to build a treadmill

298
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,079
that mines bitcoin because

299
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,360
for ethereum it takes maybe a hundred

300
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,839
watts and if you run really really fast

301
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,440
you can do 80 watts

302
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,600
so if you run super fast like gal and

303
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,480
some of the other

304
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,160
lectures that we had here maybe you

305
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,279
could mine bitcoin on uh

306
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,200
on the b sides we need to do that next

307
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,120
year

308
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,040
next year we're gonna mine bitcoin on

309
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,240
the stage okay the answer is 179

310
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,279
kilowatts

311
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,120
that's how much energy you need to mine

312
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,320
for bitcoin

313
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,760
and we have a fan it's a flying fan all

314
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,079
right

315
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,560
they're flying fans of besides flying

316
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,519
pan

317
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,920
flying pan all right you keep doing that

318
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,920
i'll check backstage

319
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,839
and these are not the droids you're

320
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,040
looking for all right

321
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,560
so nothing is fully defined because

322
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,399
nothing is ever fully defined

323
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,040
and it can be definitely abused that

324
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,720
anybody ever abused any sort of

325
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,440
standards

326
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,600
to make it break and do your own thing

327
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,600
any examples from the crowd

328
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,880
yes no

329
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,320
okay so

330
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,040
the numbers talk so this is a graph

331
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,120
showing the numbers of people submitting

332
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,120
talks to cfp versus the number of people

333
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,360
people getting accepted you can see that

334
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,880
year after year we're getting more and

335
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,760
more talks

336
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,959
submitted into besides tlv showing a

337
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,639
great growth in our local community

338
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:31,680
which is amazing

339
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,160

342
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,360

343
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,279

344
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,440

want to submit a talk for next year

347
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:53,839

348
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,519
um be mindful

349
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,240
be sensible to one another everybody

350
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,600
next to you

351
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,279

352
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,720
you be mindful of them be

353
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,279
gracious of them tell them hi be nice to

354
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,639
them even though there's coveted in

355
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:13,760
everything

356
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,279
wear your mask but still be nice

357
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,120
in inline is never safe so

358
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,440
unsafe eval and unsafe eli inline it's

359
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,160
definitely

360
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,560
what we definitely need to do um

361
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,160
no okay okay

362
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,360
um poor usage so

363
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,880
someone was looking for a common

364
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,199
directive and find over found over

365
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,320
700 of them and there are only

366
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,839
30. so i don't know how that makes sense

367
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:48,560
but

368
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,199
okay so data isn't normalized did

369
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:53,760
anybody

370
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,440
ever found any sort of data that was

371
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,160
normalized and make their life easier

372
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,760
anybody doing any sort of hunting or

373
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,560
researching and found any sort of data

374
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,920

375

382
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,320
