1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,240
tell you about the next talk it's going

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,600
to be awesome

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,080
we're going to go back to the criminal's

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,160
perspective to see how cyber criminals

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,120
do things

6
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,360
and just imagine you're a cyber criminal

7
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,200
how do you decide

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,640
which malware to go with this is what

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,600
the next speaker

10
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,680
is going to tell us all about sergey you

11
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,359
can come and join me here so please

12
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,640
welcome sergey

13
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,090
shaike

14
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,400
[Applause]

15
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,640
sergey is a fred intelligence leader for

16
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,439
q6

17
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,159
cyber and what he does all day every day

18
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,160
is to monitor analyze and research

19
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,800
criminal communities so sergey is going

20
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,200
to show

21
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,399
us how criminals decide which

22
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,440
malware to use take it away sergey

23
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,039
hey hello good afternoon everyone thanks

24
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,520
for having me here

25
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,239
second yeah i'm excited to be here on

26
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,960
besides stage for a second time

27
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,320
and so first of all in short about me

28
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,920
i'm director of intelligent acoustic

29
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,559
cyber

30
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,040
as karen mentioned what we do all the

31
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,119
day is to understand how cyber criminals

32
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:08,080
are working

33
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,479
what they are thinking and to understand

34
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:11,680
their point of view

35
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,520
we are dealing a lot with the botnet

36
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,799
data and the

37
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,880
different botnets and banking malware

38
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,159
payment card data

39
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,680
money mules and the strategies

40
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,119
themselves to understand what they are

41
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,640
doing how they are thinking

42
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,799
and who they are

43
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,439
so what we will talk about it today we

44
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,159
will talk about

45
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,360
malware but that we know all that it's a

46
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,600
basic and key part of any cybercrime

47
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,720
operation and chain but we will talk

48
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,560
about it not from a perspective of

49
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,520
researcher

50
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,280
we will talk about it from perspective

51
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,600
of underground how cyber criminals view

52
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,399
it

53
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,360
in the beginning i will list you how

54
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,880
they view the malware world

55
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,119
what how they divide it what types of

56
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,040
malware available in the underground and

57
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,159
then i will move to the

58
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,000
their consideration how they choose what

59
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,200
to use

60
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,680
and it's a this perspective in many

61
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,240
cases

62
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,280
is quite different than what you

63
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,840
see as the ones who research it

64
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,680
so what do we need to run botnet

65
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,560
operation

66
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,120
malware is definitely one of the

67
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,520
components of it but it's not enough

68
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,680
as you see there are three additional

69
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,680
important components to run a button a

70
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,520
successful botnet operation

71
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,959
it's a malware it's a crypt crypt is a

72
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,599
underground the term for obfuscation of

73
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,080
the

74
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,040
malware file and making it full and

75
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,840
detectable

76
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,080
by antiviruses it's a very basic and

77
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,760
important term in the underground

78
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,239
because

79
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,720
otherwise after one two campaign in two

80
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,959
three days each model will be

81
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,319
detected by all the antivirus engines

82
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,720
the third part is the infrastructure the

83
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,319
c2 servers

84
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,319
all this part and the last part and

85
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,080
maybe the most complicated is the

86
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,959
traffic

87
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,000
basically how the cyber criminals in uh

88
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,760
get their victims how they do the

89
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,120
infection part

90
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,000
so those are the four parts that when

91
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,760
cyber criminal starts his

92
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,000
malware operation botnet operation he

93
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,120
has to consider

94
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,040
he has to understand how he builds all

95
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,720
these to one big operation

96
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,159
so i divided this world of

97
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,720
malware in the underground to to two or

98
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,920
even three parts

99
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,440
first of all it's a division between

100
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,440
desktop malware and mobile

101
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,239
and the desktop part the most common

102
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,400
division is between full take malware

103
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,040
and skillers while talking about the

104
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,720
mobile malware it's important to mention

105
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,280
that

106
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,319
in the cybercam underground it's a solar

107
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,879
android malware it's almost doesn't

108
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,080
exist

109
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,400
in the cybercrime under and ios malware

110
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,239
it's extremely rare

111
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,360
i would say almost too non-existent very

112
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,120
rare

113
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,959
so what's the difference what are the

114
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,280
key features of those malwares and

115
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,200
why cyber criminals divide it and build

116
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,319
all those

117
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,319
here i listed only several of the key

118
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,360
features so

119
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,840
full take malware is basically a malware

120
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,439
that has a

121
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,840
app i would say in many cases some will

122
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,959
call to it

123
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,959
apt malware that has all the

124
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,959
capabilities like a common apt

125
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,680
that operated by nation state actors it

126
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,120
has a credentials grabber

127
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,080
it has a keylogger cookie grabber it it

128
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,919
is able to capture screenshots from the

129
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,040
victim's machine

130
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,759
it has a vnc model virtual network

131
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:32,720
computing model

132
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,479
that allows cyber criminals to remotely

133
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:35,919
connect to victims machine

134
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,840
and do all their for example fraud

135
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,320
activity account takeover activity from

136
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,960
victims machine and web injections that

137
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,280
i will talk in a bit

138
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,479
distillers are much more common and much

139
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:49,360
more basic

140
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,120
they have very basic capabilities like

141
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,800
credentials grabbing

142
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,960
it it allows cyber criminals to still

143
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,479
browse browser history

144
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,400
crypto wallet that's something very

145
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,240
common to steal a

146
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,479
the files of a called crypto wallet from

147
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:03,440
the desktop or

148
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,919
folders of the infected machines and

149
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,280
cookie grabber

150
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,919
while the android malware has quite

151
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,000
different capabilities it's also very

152
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,680
lucrative to cyber criminals but with

153
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,520
android it's not so simple

154
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,360
and i will show you it in in several

155
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,720
minutes why

156
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,560
but the main features of android

157
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,520
malware or sms sending an interception

158
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,960
that's something cyber criminals like a

159
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,759
lot

160
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,160
it's a key logger it's ability to lock

161
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,120
the device

162
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,560
and overlays so now i

163
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,240
want to talk a bit what are web

164
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,160
injections or overlays as

165
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,479
technologically they are a bit different

166
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,759
but their goal is the same the goal is

167
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,240
to trick the user into entering certain

168
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,520
sensitive information

169
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,320
and giving it to cyber criminals and

170
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,720
what is required to use web injection

171
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,360
on full tech malware or over overlay on

172
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,479
mobile malware

173
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,240
that the malware is already running on

174
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,400
victims machine that there is already an

175
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,360
infection

176
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,360
it's not like fishing or something like

177
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,560
this and this mod those models make

178
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,039
the full tech malware and mobile malware

179
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,160
so lucrative for cyber criminals

180
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,319
how does it work so here i want to

181
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,680
provide you some example about

182
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,080
how web injections work the overlay from

183
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,960
the conceptual

184
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,800
perspective are relatively similar but

185
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,960
technologically they work different

186
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,120
so when the victim's machine is already

187
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,400
infected

188
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,800
so when the victim visits a specific

189
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,160
website that matches a

190
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,120
pattern for example has the part amazon

191
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,479
the keyword amazon

192
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,160
so then what happens is men in the

193
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,840
browser attack

194
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,080
and this web injection model injects

195
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,160
html or javascript code

196
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,479
to the content before it's rendered on

197
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,840
the web browser

198
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,280
and what the user sees is basically a

199
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,759
different page it's a fake page of

200
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,080
amazon and not the original one

201
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,240
and mostly it'll it allows the cyber

202
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,479
criminals to add additional fields and

203
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,120
questions for example if the real amazon

204
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,319
pays ask

205
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,520
just for username and password so using

206
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:05,840
web

207
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,960
injects the web the cyber criminals will

208
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,000
ask for username

209
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,560
password and also for payment card

210
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,720
number cvv expiration and maybe

211
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,639
also some secret questions to bank

212
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,080
account

213
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,759
that's kind of the trick and that's why

214
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,919
cyber criminals like so much to use it

215
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,560
well there are three main types of web

216
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,759
injections

217
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,599
it's the one the basic ones that i

218
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,840
described those are information skillers

219
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,960
basically really to steal the

220
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,280
information like i described to you

221
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,039
the second one is token interception

222
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,800
because think about it it allows cyber

223
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,160
criminals also

224
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,440
to trick the users to enter also

225
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,560
the secret code or one-time code part of

226
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,240
it because most of the web injections

227
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,199
are complicated

228
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,720
and multi-staging and in very kind of

229
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,520
sophisticated cases it's also what is

230
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:55,840
called

231
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,879
atf automated transfer system that when

232
00:07:58,879 --> 00:07:59,280
a

233
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,560
cyber criminal for example let's take

234
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,720
now an example of bank account

235
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,960
when he visits tries to build his real

236
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,400
bank account

237
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,520
so he is a fake page of the bank

238
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,440
provides his credential secret question

239
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,879
and answer

240
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,479
and then this web index automatically

241
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,400
logins into account and conducts a

242
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,560
transfer from his account

243
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,599
in the same moment and all this is built

244
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,160
in and that's why cyber criminals like

245
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,599
it so much

246
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,919
uh so that's how you have injections

247
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,840
work overlays are pretty similar

248
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,718
just on mobile

249
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,159
so what's the offer of those

250
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,559
as you can see here there are several

251
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,640
types of full-tech malware those are the

252
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,040
the most rare and complicated and i will

253
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,080
show you why

254
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,320
it's very easy to really be user of

255
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,800
those but the most common that i'm sure

256
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,880
you heard about those it's trigger dry

257
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,480
decks gaussian sfb

258
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,000
z loader and others well on the steeler

259
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,040
parts the offer

260
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,920
is i would say huge you see there is red

261
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,480
line raccoon towers with our other

262
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,360
predator the thief osce and other

263
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,880
versions and the

264
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,880
and each one of those also has many

265
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,279
forks for example ezra that is already

266
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,320
let's say a deadman sealer but

267
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,720
it has a lot of different forks that's

268
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,320
quite similar to azeroth

269
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,480
so the offer here is very wide of

270
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,760
steelers and why

271
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,880
because basically the

272
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,360
the effort to build and develop a good

273
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:31,920
sealer

274
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,440
is 100 times less than to develop a good

275
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,959
full tech malware

276
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,519
that's basically the the reason and on

277
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,160
the mobile

278
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,399
malware side the offer is very limited

279
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,080
even less than full-tech malware

280
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,399
it's servers anubis and alien while

281
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,279
service

282
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,440
source code was leaked a year and a half

283
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,640
ago so it's

284
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,640
i would say most people do not use any

285
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,680
more servers

286
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,800
so it's even as an anubis and alien the

287
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,000
offer is very limited

288
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,959
here you can see that many of the cyber

289
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,000
criminals also having

290
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,240
those discussions what to choose

291
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,640
especially about distillers by the way

292
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,640
because the entry point to use distiller

293
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,200
is very low

294
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,959
you can see here from their real forms

295
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,200
which tiller to choose in 2021

296
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,600
hello to all goat people i'm looking now

297
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,200
and there are a lot of steelers but i

298
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,720
don't know which one is the

299
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,120
best for hackers which one is the most

300
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,120
relevant and causes the highest damage

301
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,720
a real post from a big russian

302
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,320
underground forum

303
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,640
and another one which still is better my

304
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,399
goal is to use my landing page

305
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,040
also please write one of why one or

306
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,040
another is better what are the pros and

307
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,200
cons there are a lot of discussions

308
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,800
around it in the underground

309
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,800
what to use because there are a lot of

310
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,000
consideration and it's

311
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,399
not easy for especially entry-level

312
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,519
cyber criminals to choose what to use

313
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,320
now let's talk about how they actually

314
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,279
choose

315
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,760
which one of those that i described you

316
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,120
there to use

317
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,519
whether to use full-tech malware steeler

318
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,279
or a mobile mother and what to use

319
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,640
inside each category

320
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,760
there are four main considerations what

321
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,240
to use

322
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,320
the one is a monetization goal why they

323
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,160
want to use it what's their goal what

324
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,640
they

325
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,399
how they get the money in the end of the

326
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,480
day the second is availability

327
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,519
what is available and what can uh they

328
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,240
get

329
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,800
the pricing i will show you that the

330
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,279
price

331
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,600
ranges are very wide between different

332
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,200
categories and malwares

333
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,040
and the business model and maintenance

334
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,200
of the malware each malware vendor and

335
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,920
developer

336
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,079
has a different business model how he

337
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,200
sells it how he

338
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,279
maintains it and what he provides to his

339
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,680
clients

340
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,680
so the first consideration are the

341
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,040
monetization goals

342
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,360
each cyber criminals when he starts his

343
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,959
malware operations

344
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,680
he has specific goal what will he what

345
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,720
will he do with

346
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,800
when he will infect the endpoint users

347
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,760
so the i would say the least

348
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,360
sophisticated and basic

349
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,600
goals are mostly or to steal gaming

350
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,560
accounts

351
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,839
of fortnite or any other stuff

352
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,680
it's very common very popular by the way

353
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,440
those accounts do not cost a lot in the

354
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,399
underground

355
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,800
but it's easy and it provides money to

356
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,959
steal payment card and crypto wallets

357
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,279
becomes a bit more difficult mostly from

358
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,440
a monetization perspective

359
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,519
while i'm saying monetization it's what

360
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,279
they now steal the account what they do

361
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,639
with it because

362
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,399
it's not enough just when you still

363
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,680
payment card you should

364
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,079
be able to understand also how to use it

365
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,880
how to

366
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,040
beat different anti-fraud controls of

367
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,079
the bank

368
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,360
payment card companies so

369
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,360
that's what i mean by monetization the

370
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,560
more complicated

371
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,880
monetizations goals and and mostly they

372
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,160
are applied to more sophisticated

373
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,040
cybercrimes

374
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,600
our banking account because mostly the

375
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,600
anti-fraud controls and cyber security

376
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,079
controls in banking accounts are

377
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,839
much more sophisticated than for example

378
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,680
in gaming industry

379
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,839
and even if you get the password for

380
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,760
some account it doesn't mean you will

381
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,440
be able to log into the account and

382
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,040
steal the money you need

383
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,240
much more ecommerce merchants there is a

384
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,519
huge market for uh credentials to admin

385
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,680
panel of e-commerce merchants

386
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,320
for admin for a password to magento open

387
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,440
card panels

388
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,279
why because they cyber criminals can

389
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,120
install different sniffers and this way

390
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,000
still payment cards on a scale

391
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,160
and maybe the most complicated

392
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,600
monetization goal

393
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,079
those are the cyber criminals who infect

394
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,279
with malware

395
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,160
to get access to corporate networks

396
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:32,560
because

397
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,200
maybe it sounds great you have now an

398
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,440
access to big corporation big bank

399
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,320
but now to monetize it it's not so easy

400
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,160
because mostly the controls are pretty

401
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,199
sophisticated

402
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,720
and many people for example cyber

403
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,880
criminals deploy

404
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,519
a ransomware but also rent to deplorance

405
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,720
or you need a lot of

406
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,399
knowledge how do you propagate in the

407
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,040
network how you you identify the backups

408
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,320
and et cetera et cetera

409
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,519
so that's i would say the most

410
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,920
sophisticated uh

411
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,160
goal of cyber criminals and i would say

412
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,880
the vast majority of the cyber criminals

413
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,959
are not able to monetize corporate

414
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,079
networks

415
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,880
okay even they get access to some nice

416
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,639
server in a big company or something

417
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,000
mostly they will sell it

418
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,079
just because the monetization is very

419
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,000
difficult so that's a basic

420
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,519
consideration when someone chooses what

421
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,440
malware to use what they will do with

422
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,000
the victims

423
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,160
the second consideration is the

424
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,560
availability there is a very

425
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,360
common term in the underground of public

426
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,959
versus private

427
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,120
so what does it mean public it doesn't

428
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,800
mean that you can find this malware on

429
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,760
google

430
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,079
what does it mean that you can find the

431
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,000
malware developer and just

432
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,600
rent on buy the malware on the

433
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,680
underground forums it's easy you just

434
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,639
pay the money

435
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,959
and you get the malware while the term

436
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,320
private that

437
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,800
means that developers and those who are

438
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,240
behind the malware families

439
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,560
are not in our own forums mostly and you

440
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,920
can't just find them and

441
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,240
say i'm paying now this amount of money

442
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,839
and i'm getting this

443
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,120
that's the difference between those

444
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,199
terms so the

445
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,199
second part of the availability for

446
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,880
mostly the private malware is to

447
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,639
understand who is the developer

448
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,240
because for example if the malware is

449
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,079
trigboot

450
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,399
many people and many law enforcement and

451
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,240
companies wish to know who exactly is

452
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:20,560
the

453
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,760
developer of trigbot or drydex and

454
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,800
how to approach him here we come to the

455
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,880
vetted approach even if you now get the

456
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,320
jabber jabber is the

457
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,040
common uh mean of communication in the

458
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,800
russian underground even if you know the

459
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,839
jabber of

460
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,320
the developer of trigbot if you now just

461
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,720
start a conversation with him and ask

462
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,560
to get to be affiliate of uh trigboot

463
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,320
he will just say ignore you he

464
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,839
definitely will ignore you

465
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,680
he will ask you who are you who

466
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,000
recommended you why how you find my

467
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,720
jabber and how i know you are not

468
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,639
working with law enforcement or cyber

469
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,160
security companies

470
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,880
so you need also some very solid

471
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,079
reputation

472
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,000
especially for full tech malware

473
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,600
families like trigbot and drydex you

474
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,079
just

475
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,040
can't out of never come to the developer

476
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,000
and

477
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,399
get this smaller that's one of the

478
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,519
reasons by the way why

479
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,000
they fight with those malware families

480
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,759
is so complicated because also the

481
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,600
developers and the people behind it

482
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,480
are not mostly are not in the forums you

483
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:22,959
can't

484
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,800
find the information about what they are

485
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,320
doing how they are working just

486
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,759
passively collecting in forums

487
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,720
you can see here several examples now of

488
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,240
people looking for different malware

489
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:36,959
families

490
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,880
so in the beginning those are more the

491
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,240
full take malware the more

492
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,880
uh vetted and sophisticated model for

493
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,920
example someone

494
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,720
that is looking for immortal owner the

495
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,680
emote is

496
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,240
one of the common loaders of trigbot

497
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,279
that was

498
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,440
taken down about eight ten months ago

499
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,440
but he continues operating the takedown

500
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,920
was successful for several months

501
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,240
but uh the same by the way trick but it

502
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,040
was successful

503
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,880
several months but it continues

504
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,640
operating and maybe even on the higher

505
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,880
scale than it was previously

506
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,119
so some cyber criminals in april this

507
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,119
year looking for owner of imitate and

508
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,319
ask so

509
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,799
send him private message by the way at

510
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,480
least in this this thread no one

511
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,280
answered him

512
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,679
because most likely even if the owner of

513
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,439
imitate and the developer will see it he

514
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,559
will

515
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,520
he will not answer

516
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,960
the same about gauzy isfv another cyber

517
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,559
criminals is looking for the developer

518
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:31,760
of gaussia isob

519
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,240
and even specific version of gaussian

520
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,200
issb

521
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,320
the redeveloped version also but no one

522
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,520
answered him

523
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,919
the same he wants to rent but again he

524
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,760
needs someone to

525
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,919
who will recommend him to the developer

526
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,200
of gaussian sfv

527
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,960
provide him with contact details and

528
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,559
then provide the

529
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,600
vetting for him on the other side with

530
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,400
the sealers

531
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,880
it's much more easier there is

532
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,080
relatively easy

533
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,720
to find in different underground

534
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,600
communities just

535
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,880
threads of developers of uh

536
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,080
steelers that just advertising it and

537
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,160
offering it for the cyber criminals you

538
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,000
can see here a thread of towers

539
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,320
stealer a thread of raccoon a very

540
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,840
common sealer last year that

541
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,160
is running for a last since the

542
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,480
beginning of 2019

543
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,039
and has about dozens of pages of people

544
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,360
who are buying it

545
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,919
the same about thread of redline it's a

546
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,000
just a small effort and the cyberpunk

547
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,960
find distillers because those people who

548
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,679
developed

549
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,799
them they just want to offer it to

550
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,679
wide audience let's call it this way

551
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:40,720
they do not

552
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,799
vet and anyone who pays for it will

553
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,320
receive it and get it

554
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,280
and you can see here in the pricing for

555
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,960
example redline 150

556
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,600
for a month relatively not expensive

557
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,200
i would like to talk a bit now on this

558
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,080
point about

559
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,720
mobile malware because there is a huge

560
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,679
demand of it

561
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,000
a lot of people talking about it you can

562
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,760
see here at least several uh

563
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,160
four different threads from last month's

564
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,919
about people talking about it asking

565
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:10,960
what's there

566
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,200
servers is dead what are alternative

567
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,520
android botnets is it possible to find

568
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,160
anything there or another guy tells all

569
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,200
went private

570
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,720
due to the fact that it's impossible to

571
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,400
create any more background services in

572
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,320
most of the samsung devices

573
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,799
so no one now offers really mobile

574
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,000
malware in the underground

575
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,120
as i mentioned previously only alien

576
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,440
and mostly it's now even alien i would

577
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,520
say this way

578
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,160
but does it worth it are there a lot of

579
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,000
really successful cyber criminals who

580
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,880
operate the

581
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,240
mobile malware from my experience no

582
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,799
it's much more difficult to run

583
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:47,919
successful campaign

584
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,520
and operation of mobile malware than

585
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,880
desktop ones mostly due to the infection

586
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,679
vector

587
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,400
it's much more difficult to do

588
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,360
infections

589
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,080
on a high scale and on wide scale

590
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,039
because

591
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,240
based on most of the mobile controls now

592
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,640
in the end of the day you need the you

593
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,120
have to trick the end user the victim

594
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,159
to download some application and it's

595
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,840
not very easy

596
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,240
in most cases what we see and even if

597
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:16,880
the

598
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,960
endpoint user the victim downloads it

599
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,200
and is being infected

600
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,320
so the average lifetime of such victim

601
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:24,799
is

602
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,520
mostly less than 72 hours because mostly

603
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,360
those malicious applications

604
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,280
don't have real functionality they are

605
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,720
just malicious

606
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,280
and after several hours or day or two

607
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,000
the

608
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,919
victim understands even if he doesn't

609
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,760
understand he downloaded the malware

610
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,679
but he doesn't send the application he

611
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,760
downloaded doesn't work as expected

612
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,200
so he just deletes it and there is a

613
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,720
live malware most of the mobile malware

614
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,320
families we observed

615
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,960
have dozens up to small hundreds of

616
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,600
victims

617
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,000
while just for comparison triggered last

618
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,600
four years had about five million

619
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,480
victims

620
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,880
immature has every year millions of

621
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,600
victims

622
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,039
stealers have thousands in some cases

623
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,960
tens of thousands of victims

624
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,360
that it's very rare that a mobile

625
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,440
malware or someone who runs it

626
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,919
gets even to a several thousand thousand

627
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:17,600
victims it's rare i won't say it

628
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,760
never happens but it's rare the

629
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,600
operation is very difficult

630
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,360
and many cyber criminals kind of see

631
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,880
this locative try it

632
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,240
and then understand that they are not

633
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,480
able to do anything successful because

634
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,600
in the end of the day

635
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:34,159
they need a live bots victims that are

636
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,320
infected for a long time mostly and it

637
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,960
doesn't happen

638
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,520
the third consideration is the price and

639
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,640
that's an important

640
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,120
consideration but i listed it as number

641
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,360
three not the first and not the second

642
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,320
the most of the models have two types of

643
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:54,960
pricing

644
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,880
one-time payment just to be part of the

645
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,440
to be the really the the user or

646
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,960
affiliate of specific malware

647
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,600
and then you pay on a monthly basis for

648
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,039
updates for uh

649
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,159
such stuff so the the

650
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,280
pricing is really on this huge range

651
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,280
when we start with steelers or towers

652
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,600
redline raccoon it's mostly

653
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,360
several hundred dollars at most per

654
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,080
month when we go to mobile malware it

655
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,840
becomes more expensive

656
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,919
it can be two three thousand dollars

657
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,679
around this depends on which malware who

658
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:28,480
is the vendor

659
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,240
when we go to full take malware for

660
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,919
example one time one

661
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,880
month of uh use of or sniff goes the sfv

662
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,640
it's about 3500

663
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,200
and on the other side really really

664
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,400
expensive but

665
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,480
maybe the most sophisticated and

666
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,400
successful malware on the market now

667
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,880
is strict boot one month of use cost 153

668
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,919
000 out of this the one-time

669
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,320
payment just to start using it is one

670
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,919
hundred fifty thousand dollars

671
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,000
just to be affiliate someone who is

672
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,240
allowed to use trigbot and then every

673
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:00,880
month

674
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,960
you pay between three to five thousand

675
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,919
dollars

676
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,640
to to be a user of the trigger it's very

677
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,440
expensive

678
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,600
and most of the let's call them

679
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,520
entry-level cyber criminals just

680
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,440
even if they pass all the previous steps

681
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,280
like to get wetted approach to

682
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,039
understand who is the developer

683
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,200
they want to infect big networks they

684
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,280
just don't have such money

685
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,600
it's very expensive and the users of

686
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,919
trigbot all the cyberpunks who use it

687
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,120
they do know what they do and they know

688
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,480
how they will monetize it

689
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,840
otherwise they will not pay such a high

690
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,080
sum just to be a user of this malware

691
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,159
because mostly the revenue of the users

692
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,039
of trigbots

693
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,600
are in millions in months or in some

694
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,200
cases even more

695
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,400
it it starts from a fraud account

696
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,039
takeover

697
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,440
and uh elc transfer in big banks in

698
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,240
europe in

699
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,720
the us in some cases one transfer they

700
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,600
do

701
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,760
we observe the several cases of half

702
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,440
million dollar in one transfer

703
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,559
for example successful transfer they

704
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,880
do all the big ransomware attacks like

705
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,679
reveal

706
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,919
like igregor or another that in many

707
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,039
cases they they

708
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,880
run some demand it starts from several

709
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,360
million dollars up to 20 25 billion

710
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,000
dollars

711
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,159
so they know what they do so they are

712
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,880
able also to pay this uh

713
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,840
rent fee

714
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,559
and the last consideration is the

715
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,120
business model and maintenance

716
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,880
different malware families and

717
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,400
developers have different business

718
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,039
models

719
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,080
what they sell the most basic one and

720
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,520
the least sophisticated that

721
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,120
most of the really serious cyber

722
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,559
criminals will not

723
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,880
uh use this model and will not rent

724
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,480
malware under those conditions

725
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,039
it's one type time malwarebuilt if you

726
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:43,919
just receive

727
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,320
one executable you can run one campaign

728
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,159
and most likely after this campaign

729
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,080
it won't be relevant anymore it will be

730
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,200
undetectable

731
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,480
detected by many antivirus engines

732
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,600
the second is malware build support for

733
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,080
end support for specific typeframe for

734
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:00,720
example for

735
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,440
months two three most in the essential

736
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,640
part of this support

737
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,799
is to keep the malware fully

738
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,559
undetectable by uh

739
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,720
engines mostly cyberknows what they do

740
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,720
they use the same virustotal as we are

741
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,440
we are using or other similar engines

742
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,559
and run

743
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,880
their build of the malware before they

744
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,320
do a campaign and check

745
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,679
how many antiviruses and

746
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,120
security solutions sign and detect their

747
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,279
build that's what they are doing so

748
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,720
that's the key part that the

749
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,320
vendor and the malware developer

750
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,760
provides support

751
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,600
and mostly it's a what i mentioned

752
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,159
previously crypt

753
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,600
obfuscation of the malware file the a

754
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,679
bit more sophisticated part it's only

755
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,960
also includes a new features because

756
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,559
there are a lot of demand for different

757
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,640
stuff for example a year ago most of the

758
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,960
steeler and marvel families didn't have

759
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,360
a dedicated model to steal cold wallets

760
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,480
of crypto

761
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,520
now almost each and every stealer has

762
00:25:59,520 --> 00:25:59,919
such

763
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,760
models for specific uh cryptocurrencies

764
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,840
and the same full-tech malware that's

765
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,679
for example a feature

766
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,679
so that's another subscription and the

767
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:11,360
more sophisticated and the

768
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,200
interesting one is malware as a service

769
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,840
and bots as a service

770
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,240
malware is a service basically when a

771
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,840
developer provides

772
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,080
a malware as part of malware service

773
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,919
model he provides the malware the

774
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:25,360
executable the crypt

775
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,360
the support to keep the executable

776
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,320
undetectable and the infrastructure

777
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,840
he is the one who provides all the

778
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,840
infrastructure of c2 servers

779
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,320
he's the one who maintains it he's the

780
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,000
one who changes it will require

781
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,720
his one who looks for a bulletproof

782
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,440
hosting

783
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,919
where to host it and all this mostly

784
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:44,880
this model

785
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,919
is a common for a full take malware but

786
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,320
there are also some steelers like vidar

787
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,679
for example that provides

788
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,679
it in partial model also in this case

789
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,799
basically the cyber criminals needs much

790
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,120
less knowledge especially technological

791
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,480
knowledge to use the malware

792
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,880
the only thing he has to do is basically

793
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,000
the traffic

794
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
to think how he infects for example

795
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
spamming campaigns or

796
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,400
different areas uh other chains of

797
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,320
infection

798
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,480
and the last model the the most

799
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,760
sophisticated and the

800
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,279
maybe the coolest one for cyber

801
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,440
criminals but also the most expensive is

802
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,440
bots as a service

803
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,480
this model exists i would say ultimately

804
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,080
and only with the full tech malware

805
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,760
families while

806
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,919
the cyber criminal the endpoint cyber

807
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,360
criminals orders not

808
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,520
in the pace not only for the malware

809
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,720
crypt infrastructure

810
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,120
but he pays also for the traffic and

811
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,120
what he gets in the end of the day

812
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,200
he doesn't need to have any

813
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,399
technological knowledge

814
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:47,039
he just gets a c2 panel with the

815
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,799
infected machines

816
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,600
that's what he gets but he also pays

817
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,880
accordingly

818
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,960
mostly for example in some models of

819
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,480
ursif the cost of

820
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,600
1 000 both victims is 20 000

821
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,159
for example some groups provided because

822
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:02,799
someone

823
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,279
is doing all the work all the difficult

824
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,279
to work technological work infection

825
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,679
and you get the bots but many cyber

826
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,200
sophisticated cybernetics

827
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,039
work this way so that's

828
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:17,919
those are the main models and the ways

829
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:18,559
so

830
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,399
before i summarize i wanted to agree to

831
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:21,679
give you two short

832
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,080
snapchat about how cyber criminals view

833
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:24,799
what is

834
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,720
ideal android malware and what is the

835
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,840
ideal steeler

836
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,120
because there are also a lot of

837
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,799
discussions about it what cyber

838
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:33,200
criminals really want to see in those

839
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,840
malware families so ideally android

840
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,799
malware mostly

841
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,240
will include at least from cyber

842
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,159
criminals perspective by the way i will

843
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:40,559
tell it

844
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,039
in advance i think such malware does not

845
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,600
exist at all with all those capabilities

846
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,279
they would like to see modularity and

847
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,960
minimum required functionality

848
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,320
because in this case it will be much

849
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,399
more difficult to detect it

850
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,039
they want hidden vnc that will allow

851
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,080
remotely connect

852
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,080
easily contact and conduct any activity

853
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,399
for malware for a victim's phone

854
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,399
web index for payment cards they want to

855
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,240
root permission capabilities

856
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,559
of the malware they want sms sending an

857
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:09,600
interception and anti-slim function

858
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,240
such malware as my best knowledge

859
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,799
currently doesn't exist and

860
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,720
especially publicly is not offered in

861
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,000
the underground and i think

862
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,679
maybe the most complicated part is root

863
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,720
permission capabilities

864
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,440
from there what is ideal steeler it's

865
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,520
much more simpler

866
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,520
the cyber commas looking for a sealer

867
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,200
that will be fully undetectable all the

868
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:31,760
time

869
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,320
will have high quality locks parsing

870
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,399
admin panel with variety of filters and

871
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,240
ability to grab cold wallets

872
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,159
as you can see two out of the four

873
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:43,279
features here connected to data mining

874
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:44,799
currently that's maybe one of the

875
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,960
biggest obstacles of cyber criminals

876
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,840
they are able to get over most of other

877
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,720
stuff

878
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,640
but their difficulty is how they mine

879
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,080
all the big data because some of the

880
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,919
panels have

881
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,360
hundreds of thousands of victims

882
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,960
millions of victims

883
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,600
billions of records how to mine the data

884
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,120
that's the biggest obstacle now for

885
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,840
cyber criminals

886
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,480
and just to summarize so a full take

887
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,320
malware is expensive

888
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,120
is mostly vetted and or private but it

889
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,440
has a very sophisticated capabilities

890
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,520
and very lucrative for seasoned cyber

891
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,720
criminals

892
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,279
distillers are cheap there is a very

893
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,960
wide offer of those but

894
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,200
their capabilities are pretty limited

895
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,039
and the mobile modeler there is very

896
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:28,000
limited offer

897
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:37,520
and low success rate thank you

898
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,840
any questions thank you sergey i have a

899
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,200
question for you

900
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,559

901
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,840
