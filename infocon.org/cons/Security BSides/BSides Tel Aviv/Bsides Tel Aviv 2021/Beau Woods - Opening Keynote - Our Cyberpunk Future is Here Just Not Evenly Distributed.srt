1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
our keynote speaker is someone who i

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,399
absolutely adore he's my personal cyber

3
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:07,359
safety hero

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,519
and he's going to talk to us about why

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:11,200
our cyberpunk future

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,759
is here but it's not evenly distributed

7
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,519
so let's hear a little bit about him

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:16,160
okay

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,359
beau woods beau woods is from the i am

00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,680
and with different villages

14
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,080
like the aerospace village the ics

15
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:30,720
village

16
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,120
and the biohacking village he's also the

17
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:33,920
co-author

18
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,360

he participates many years in defcon and

22
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,000
b-sides in

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,399
fact beau brought me to my very first

24
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,039
besides

25
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,760
las vegas now one more fun fact about

26
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,640
our speaker

27
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,440
as i see he's ready backstage he was a

28
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,640
volunteer

29
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,680
at the very first b-sides tel aviv

30
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,359
2021 bo are you ready

31

a very warm besides tel aviv welcome

34
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,840
because bo woods is going to show us

35
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,479
how our cyberpunk future is becoming a

36
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:13,520
reality

37
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,360
let's give him a warm round of applause

38
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,560
bo the stage is yours

39
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,119
thank you so much thank you and remember

40
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:21,840
masks on

41
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,360
until you are on stage

42
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,360
thank you very much this is uh i think

43
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,360
it's my my third time to israel i think

44
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,200
it's my third b-sides although my first

45
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,040
one speaking so i'm very very excited to

46
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,920
be here

47
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,640
uh to be able to talk to everybody um as

48
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,159
i was putting this together

49
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,000
i really had to kind of come to grips

50
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,079
with what does it mean to be cyberpunk

51
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,920
uh and what does it mean to evenly

52
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,880
distribute a cyberpunk future

53
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,159
uh so i want to take you through some

54
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,159
thoughts on that um

55
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,720
first my day so this morning my term

56
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,320
woke me up at 6 30 way too early

57
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,719
and then i i got my pre-measured stems

58
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,840
you know coffee

59
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,680
in the form of caffeine in the form of

60
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,439
coffee

61
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,399
then i i hailed a ride with my term as

62
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,720
we do these days checked my crypto

63
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,160
credits while i was waiting

64
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,520
turns out they're down sorry uh and then

65
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,959
you know i wasn't the first one the car

66
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,640
it was a shared ride so i

67
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,360
turned my phones to blocking mode so

68
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,440
that i could silence all the noise

69
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,959
but it was okay i'm sure they didn't

70
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,200
want to talk they were already too busy

71
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,280
jacked into the net and watching movies

72
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,160
and then when i came here into the event

73
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,560
my

74
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,840
vaxcode passed i wore my mask so my mask

75
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,720
checked out

76
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,920
and here i am and so this is the the

77
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,920
cyberpunk reality that i think

78
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,920
is evenly distributed today this is what

79
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,760
we're all living through right now

80
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,599
uh looking around at so many masked

81
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,160
faces and realizing that this is what we

82
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,519
thought the future was going to be like

83
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:52,400
20 years ago

84
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,640
because of pollution and smog little did

85
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,000
we know that it would be

86
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,599
uh because of a global pandemic

87
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,640
um what does the future of cyberpunk

88
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,360
look like

89
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,560
and how is it already here well

90
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,920
most of us probably recognize this video

91
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,680
from what yesterday two days ago uh

92
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,800
this is the um

93
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,239
jeff bezos space rocket that he launched

94
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:20,879
off into

95
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,840
low earth orbit uh i think he got uh

96
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,680
somewhere around a minute worth of of

97
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,599
zero g

98
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,920
and he followed richard branson into

99
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,640
space

100
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,239
uh richard branson of course another

101
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,799
billionaire who has his eyes set on

102
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,480
going to space and spending more time

103
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,159
there and then of course

104
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,280
elon musk famously wants to to

105
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,720
spend his last days on mars but

106
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,560
this is more than just a bunch of

107
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,560
billionaires trying to one-up each other

108
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,159
trying to get into space to prove that

109
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,519
they can

110
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,120
there's much more beyond that

111
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,280
and if you recognize this video this is

112
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,120
the speech from 1961

113
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,720
where john f kennedy inspired us

114
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,239
to go to the moon not just as a nation

115
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,439
but as humanity itself bringing

116
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,239
all the world to the moon he said we

117
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,000
choose to go to the moon

118
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,840
not because it's easy but because it is

119
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,639
hard and he inspired a lot of cyberpunk

120
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,120
authors now the moonshot the original

121
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,880
moonshot it built on

122
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,960
well-known physics so we already knew

123
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,040
the physics of orbital dynamics and

124
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,199
motion but we needed new materials

125
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,240
engineering

126
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,320
we needed to have new ways of channeling

127
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,880
all of the creativity that we had within

128
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,479
the scientific community within the

129
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:39,840
engineering community

130
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,840
into this major endeavor

131
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,000
and beyond just the moon

132
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,040
we also have to look at space

133
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,240
deeper space someday

134
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,280
maybe in the not too distant future

135
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,720
we will be uh conducting space mining

136
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,320
operations

137
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,440
now there's a scale of

138
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,479
civilization maturity

139
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,600
um that posits different levels of

140
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,000
civilization will have different energy

141
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,039
capture and use capabilities

142
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,440
type one is planetary civilization these

143
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,440
are civilizations that use the entire

144
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,479
planet's

145
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,080
energy sources all at once then stellar

146
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,479
civilizations use an entire star's

147
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,000
energy source with something like a

148
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,840
dyson sphere to capture all of the

149
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,000
energy coming out of their star

150
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
type three galactic civilizations are

151
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,080
even bigger they tap into black holes in

152
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,199
the center of the universe

153
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,479
or at the center of the the the galaxy

154
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,160
now we're on about 0.72

155
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,919
i was reading on the internet so we know

156
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,479
it must be true about a 0.72

157
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,440
on this scale so we are almost to the

158
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,360
scale where we're going to go beyond our

159
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,759
planet and start using the rest of our

160
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,800
stellar resources but there's something

161
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,280
else

162
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,160
in that rocket ship that took off

163
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,520
yesterday

164
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,560
and it's the idea of rapid global

165
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,759
transport

166
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,960
by going out of the atmosphere i know in

167
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,960
a lot of the cyberpunk books

168
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,560
they have to get a character from one

169
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,400
place to another really rapidly

170
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,080
and they use this type of technology to

171
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,160
do that and it's amazing

172
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,199
to read about what we have today uh in

173
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:25,919
some of the

174
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,199
the space um uh space flights that we're

175
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,160
doing

176
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,319
and see that this might become a reality

177
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,080
you know within our lifetimes

178
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,840
it might be possible to go new york to

179
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,919
tel aviv in two hours

180
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,039
that's absolutely amazing and you might

181
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,800
be saying oh that's too far off it'll

182
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,520
never happen

183
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,360
well uh if we go back in time and look

184
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,639
at

185
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,599
flight you know just regular ordinary

186
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,280
plain old flight

187
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,120
from the 1940s to now it's changed

188
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,240
massively

189
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,360
it is massively democratized the ability

190
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,560
for us to travel around the world boston

191
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,479
to los angeles in the 40s

192
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,680
was a multi-hour in endurance race

193
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,120
12 stops 15 hours that sounds

194
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,560
grueling i don't know that i would want

195
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,840
to be on that flight and it cost the

196
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,800
equivalent of 4 500 us dollars

197
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,160
today it's a third of the time non-stop

198
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,400
and you can have it for a tenth of the

199
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,360
price

200
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,840
this is an amazing transition and again

201
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,440
this is within a single

202
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,319
lifespan but let's switch it up a little

203
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,039
bit

204
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,400
let's go from space travel to something

205
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,919
closer to us

206
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,080
medicine we're in the midst of multiple

207
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,400
concurrent revolutions in healthcare

208
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,800
there's so much going on in healthcare

209
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,720
it's absolutely astounding

210
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,160
i don't want to go into all of this i

211
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,919
have about an hour-long talk where i go

212
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,199
into all of the cool things that are

213
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,280
going on in healthcare and biohacking

214
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,840
but i just want to touch on a few of

215
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,120
them

216
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,800
there are experiments right now they're

217
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,639
actual working machines we're at the

218
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,319
engineering stage

219
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,680
where you can regrow human tissue

220
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,759
people are talking about replacing

221
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,360
things like your ear

222
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,319
or internal organs even through

223
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,759
bioreactors

224
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,800
this is absolutely phenomenal technology

225
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,919
it's it's crazy to think about

226
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,240
that this is within our reach today and

227
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,039
in fact

228
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,319
there are some biohackers who are

229
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,520
playing with this and they're doing

230
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,160
things like

231
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,800
producing insulin in a couple of jars

232
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,000
that they have set up

233
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,760
that they built for you know less than

234
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,080
50

235
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,080
we have automated surgical robots

236
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,559
now this whole video you can see that

237
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,360
the robot

238
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,200
slices off the skin of the grape and

239
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,640
then sews it back up

240
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,560
and it's doing it autonomous

241
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,920
autonomously

242
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,839
and it's a robot doing it the

243
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,760
capabilities that this brings

244
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,000
to potentially get more expert care

245
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,880
to more people is phenomenal again

246
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,560
democratizing and making these things

247
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,040
available

248
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,839
but our dystopian future is also

249
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,320
on the prep precipice it is here it's

250
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,519
just not realized yet

251
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,240
again going back to this view multiple

252
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,480
concurrent revolutions

253
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,839
but they depend on ai which we're only

254
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:24,399
really

255
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,000
starting to understand fully um

256
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,080
data driven and we know the problems

257
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,120
that we have protecting the

258
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,560
confidentiality integrity and

259
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,720
availability of data today

260
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,880
code controlled hyper-connected these

261
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,720
are issues that we have today security

262
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,240
issues and challenges that we haven't

263
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,600
yet solved today

264
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,160
let alone in future technologies like

265
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,839
bioreactors

266
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,600
in future technologies like surgical

267
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,839
robots where the conditions may be very

268
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,440
different than what we find today in

269
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,839
computers laptops servers mobile devices

270
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,040
and i want to talk about a couple of

271
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,519
these so there's some amazing technology

272
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,399
out there

273
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,040
for victims of ptsd post-traumatic

274
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,320
stress disorder

275
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,880
where you can stimulate their brain stem

276
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,519
and

277
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,519
help them recover faster this can also

278
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,959
help with epilepsy

279
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,600
it can help with all kinds of things and

280
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,120
some of these devices are going through

281
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,720
clinical trials right now

282
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,120
and some of the doctors have found that

283
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,200
the patients are actually modifying the

284
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,800
devices so that they can get high from

285
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,079
them

286
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,040
now this is not a technology that anyone

287
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,000
would have imagined

288
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,880
20 years ago you would have neural

289
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,720
implants so that you can get high except

290
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,000
in cyberpunk fiction but it is a reality

291
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,560
today

292
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,399
it's just not distributed to everyone

293
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,040
um this is an actress angel jafra and

294
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,480
she was in

295
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,279
the hunger games movies uh which is a

296
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,360
dystopian film but it's not a cyberpunk

297
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,240
film

298
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,680
um she has a prosthetic hand and this is

299
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,160
actually a bionic hand she controls it

300
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,399
by moving certain muscles in her upper

301
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,640
arm

302
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,880
this hand recharges via bluetooth

303
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,440
if you can believe it or by a usb and it

304
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,360
has bluetooth connectivity

305
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,640
so when i talked to her i invited her to

306
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,480
come out to defcon

307
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,839
and talk to people and she said i'm

308
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,440
afraid i don't know if somebody's going

309
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,240
to hack my hand

310
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,560
this is the world that we're starting to

311
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,880
live in and she asked a really

312
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,160
interesting question which is

313
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,920
if i want to go to the digital

314
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,519
equivalent of a gym

315
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,600
just you know improve the strength of

316
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,720
this hand do i have the right to do that

317
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,959
if it breaks do i have the right to even

318
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,079
repair it

319
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,519
i don't know these are legal questions

320
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,480
they're challenges that we're going to

321
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,440
have to address this is our cyberpunk

322
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,680
dystopian future where we may not even

323
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,959
be control of our bodies

324
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,480
and then this one's really interesting

325
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,720
this is a woman named poppycrom

326
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,200
and she has a few talks including this

327
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,480
great ted talk

328
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,040
talking about the end of the poker face

329
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,839
and

330
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,639
when we have the ability to capture high

331
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,079
quality

332
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,638
sensory

333
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,800
emanations thermal video

334
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,800
carbon dioxide carbon monoxide

335
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,839
monitoring

336
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,600
some of these other things that we just

337
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,000
give off naturally

338
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,480
it reveals our internal state in a way

339
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,120
that

340
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,440
we've never been able to do before

341
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,200
essentially

342
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,200
you may never be able to tell another

343
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,440
lie or have somebody believe you

344
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,959
in that lie it won't be very convincing

345
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,040
and as i was talking to her i slowly

346
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,040
started to realize that

347
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,800
it's scary that we might never be able

348
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,240
to tell a lie

349
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,920
it's even scarier to realize we may not

350
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,399
ever be able to lie to ourselves

351
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,240
think about how many rationalizations we

352
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,399
make on a daily basis

353
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,760
how many fictions we have to tell

354
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,519
ourselves to get through the day what's

355
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,639
that going to do to us

356
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,920
again this is the the dystopian cyber

357
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,519
future that we're already living in

358
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,279
okay so what do we do to change that how

359
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,079
can we be

360
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,639
better how can we make the world that we

361
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:07,680
want to see

362
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,680
you know not the world that that

363
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,959
dystopian fiction tells us has to exist

364
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,680
but the world that we want to exist as

365
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,800
passionate

366
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,200
creative hackers in this room

367
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,480
well i'll again go back to this video of

368
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,480
john f kennedy

369
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,560
because it's inspirational it sets a

370
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,160
clear vision for what we want

371
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,880
where we're going what we want to do and

372
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,240
i would like to inspire

373
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,440
everyone and encourage everyone

374
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,000
to start building not just breaking

375
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,600
breaking is fun

376
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,720
there's lots of work in breaking things

377
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,240
but but breaking isn't fundamentally

378
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,399
a generative activity it doesn't create

379
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,720
the future we want to see

380
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,120
kind of like you know race cars can only

381
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,440
go fast because they have good brakes

382
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,040
a race car's top speed is actually

383
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,639
limited by its ability to brake because

384
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,120
going around corners you want to be safe

385
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,920
but you can't create a fast race car you

386
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,519
can't create a rocket ship

387
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,639
just with the things that are going to

388
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,639
make it safe you have to do it

389
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,199
with everything else including the

390
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:17,040
things that will make it safe

391
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,680
i think we can draw on the the known

392
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,839
physics of security you know

393
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,279
we might not know all the things to do

394
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,920
to protect ourselves in cyber security

395
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,000
but we at least know how to avoid what

396
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,519
we

397
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,399
can reliably say fails so let's start

398
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,040
avoiding those things

399
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,839
and let's creatively apply ourselves

400
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,560
into new engineering

401
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,800
this is a competition held last year at

402
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,079
the virtual defcon

403
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,680
the follow-up is going to be held this

404
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,920
year at defcon in a couple of weeks

405
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,199
it's the hakka sat competition um

406
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,519
with the aerospace village they're

407
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:58,560
inviting you to come

408
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,279
and hack a satellite a satellite in

409
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,279
orbit

410
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,880
what does it look like to hack a

411
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,399
satellite well what does it look like

412
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,639
to secure a satellite when you're

413
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,800
putting something up into space

414
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,199
it's going to be thousands of miles away

415
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,240
from the nearest

416
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,040
fix-it lab you can't just bring that in

417
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,639
and update it

418
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,399
change out the hardware upgrade the

419
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,880
software you have low bandwidth high

420
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,560
latency connections

421
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,600
these are totally different

422
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,120
environmental conditions you have

423
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,800
totally different technologies that are

424
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,320
up there

425
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,560
what does it mean to have something that

426
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,000
you know has to last

427
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,880
for decades in a way that you can't

428
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,240
can't engage with it can't repair it

429
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,360
like you would

430
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,920
a terrestrial system we're going to have

431
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,720
to to apply what we know about security

432
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,279
into these new domains and build it in

433
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,519
rather than trying to bolt it on

434
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,480
work with the companies go to work with

435
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,160
somebody who inspires you somebody who's

436
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:54,800
exciting

437
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,240
one of these space companies one of the

438
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,120
healthcare companies

439
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,120
where the conditions are very different

440
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,800
than what you might see in your regular

441
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,800
job

442
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,440
my first job out of college my first job

443
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,279
in security

444
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,560
was working at a hospital where

445
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,240
the conditions that i found myself in

446
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,839
were very different from the conditions

447
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:16,800
that

448
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,800
i found later when i was working for

449
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,839
financial services organizations for

450
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,839
instance

451
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,839
in healthcare if you lock someone out of

452
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:28,720
an account

453
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,199
to preserve the confidentiality of data

454
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,800
you might inadvertently

455
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,920
come come into conflict with preserving

456
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,600
the integrity and availability of human

457
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,560
life

458
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,160
so how do we secure those health care

459
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,320
systems how do we preserve the hope

460
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,880
the promise of all of this amazing

461
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,959
incredible technology

462
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,560
i believe that the future health

463
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,279
of our species is going to be dependent

464
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,680
on the trust we can place

465
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,079
in the technology in healthcare how do

466
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,839
we ensure that people trust this

467
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:00,800
technology

468
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,800
that they will adopt it so they can have

469
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,839
the best care possible

470
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,640
and then finally how do we think about

471
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,039
equity and inclusion

472
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:15,199
uh after 1969

473
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,520
when the first astronauts landed on the

474
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,640
moon

475
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,679
um gil scott herron did an amazing

476
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:22,720
spoken word

477
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,160
and i would encourage you to go check it

478
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,919
out where he's effectively highlighting

479
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,440
um the vast gap between

480
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,320
the haves and the have-nots even after

481
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,280
we went to the moon

482
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,320
the future was not well distributed

483
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,000
and so he goes through and talks about

484
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,840
challenges of the members of his

485
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,039
community

486
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,840
to pay the rent to get health care to

487
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,840
get access

488
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,000
to enough food to eat and enough water

489
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,600
to drink

490
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,880
so that they could make a live for

491
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,640
themselves and

492
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,280
live out that dream of providing for

493
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,799
your families

494
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,880
so how do we make sure that we're not

495
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,480
inadvertently

496
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,520
biasing the future we're building

497
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,559
the benefits towards the wealthy

498
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,280
or towards small groups and all the

499
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,840
hardships

500
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,480
the less wealthy or other groups the

501
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,840
majority of groups

502
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,360
and as karen mentioned um cyberpunk is a

503
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,360
lot about low lifes and high tech

504
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,400
well how do we have high tech for all

505
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,480
and so that the the people who are in

506
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,600
the lower

507
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,960
status lower strata of society can also

508
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,320
be raised and lifted

509
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,280
along with everyone else and i want to

510
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,640
leave with a couple of quotes the first

511
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,280
one is

512
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,200
sheryl sandberg said if you're offered a

513
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,720
seat on a rocket ship you don't ask what

514
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,720
seat you just get on

515
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,039
that's kind of true but what if this is

516
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,400
your seat

517
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,640
what if you're shoveling coal you know

518
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,640
wouldn't be coal on the rocket ship

519
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,080
but what if you're the thing that is

520
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,200
um the fuel for it you don't reap the

521
00:18:59,200 --> 00:18:59,919
benefits

522
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,960
you only have the hardships how do we

523
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,080
actually get towards a cyberpunk future

524
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,160
that we can all appreciate all take

525
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,840
advantage of and all benefit from

526
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,400
the second quote is a guy named stuart

527
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,440
brand

528
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,960
he's one of the early environmental

529
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,480
movement pioneers actually one of the

530
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,600
early

531
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,120
computing pioneers as well and he said

532
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,120
we are as gods we might as well get good

533
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,400
at it that was in 1968.

534
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,960
i think that's changed a little bit i

535
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,799
think we are as gods and we must get

536
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,640
good at it

537
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,039
for the future of humanity for the

538
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,120
future of our planet

539
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,520
for the future of all of our children

540
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,440
our grandchildren

541
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,440
to ensure that they can realize the

542
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,080
dreams of high tech

543
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,520
without the dystopian parts of it

544
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,840
and so i want to leave you with a

545
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,840
thought

546
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,679
this is a thought that inspired us to

547
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,440
create eye on the cavalry

548
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,679
uh in 2013. it is that

549
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,320
the cavalry isn't coming the

550
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,919
responsibility falls to us

551
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,440
to each one of us to take an active role

552
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,360
in shaping the future how we want to see

553
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,240
it not just leaving it to someone else

554
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,679
not saying you know somebody else is

555
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,679
going to take care of this or i'm sure

556
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:20,000
you know

557
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,240
top people are working on it but to

558
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,159
actually jump in to get involved to get

559
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:25,520
engaged

560
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,679
to put a little bit of our little bit of

561
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,360
ourselves out there

562
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,200
to make the future what we want to see

563
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,880
it a much better one

564
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,159
for all of us and with that i'd like to
