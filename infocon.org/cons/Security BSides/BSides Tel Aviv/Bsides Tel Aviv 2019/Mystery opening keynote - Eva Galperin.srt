00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,919
besides we have a shot sometimes they do

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,139
it after we do it before because it

5
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:12,509
helps people deal with the stress but

6
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:14,160
it's not compulsory if you don't like

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,049

8
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:34,890
things as special pink juice yes good

galperin I'm the director of cyber

13
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,440
security for the Electronic Frontier

14
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,989
Foundation and also the head of EF Epps

15
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:52,160
threat lab which concentrates on

16
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,340
producing research that protects

17
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,949
especially vulnerable populations all

18
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:01,949
over the world so I am here to talk to

19
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:05,420
you about one such project that was

20
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,250
non-consensual E foisted upon me by the

21
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,869
universe about fighting spell swear and

22
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:16,740
stalker wear so in order to to properly

23
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,920
understand the background of this

24
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,830
horrible situation we must go back in

25
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:29,280
time it's very timely why me to what I

26
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:36,270
call the beforetime or 2017 so way back

27
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:40,950
in the beforetime in 2017 I had spent

28
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,939
several years doing security research

29
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:47,790
specifically research on a PT's

30
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,860
targeting journalists and activists back

31
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:58,159
in like 2010-2011 it was still news that

32
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,619
that there were a PT's that were not

33
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:06,000
five eyes Russia China or Israel people

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,538
were very excited to learn this they it

35
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:11,550
was also news that these apt

36
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,460
you were targeting journalists and

37
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,580
activists and so there was there was a

38
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,550
lot of work to do

39
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:23,060
unfortunately I at the end of 2017 I

40
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,370
discovered that one of my research

41
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,530
partners with whom I had done many years

42
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,380
of this research and published many

43
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:39,530
papers was a serial rapist so oops and I

44
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:47,520
was mad a little bit and I I did what

45
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,880
most people do when they get mad I

46
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:56,430
tweeted and okay really just me so what

47
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,200
happened was I'm sitting there and I'm

48
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,960
reading a an interview with one of his

49
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,400
victims and the interviewer the

50
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,130
journalist asks his victim what took you

51
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,410
so long to come forward it was you know

52
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,030
it's been many years this is a really

53
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,130
horrific story it sounds like a really

54
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,050
bad guy why didn't you say anything

55
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:19,739
earlier and she said I didn't speak up

56
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:23,160
because he was a hacker and I was scared

57
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,950
he threatened to compromise my devices I

58
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:28,140
didn't know what was safe I didn't know

59
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,900
what he would be able to do to me if if

60
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,850
I spoke up and when I read this I was

61
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:40,650
furious and so I went to the Twitter's

62
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,760
and I tweeted if you're a woman who has

63
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,440
been sexually abused by a hacker who

64
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,790
threatened to compromise your devices

65
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,410
contact me and I will make sure they are

66
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:53,010
properly examined so I thought that this

67
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:55,980
was just sort of a you know random angry

68
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,600
tweet and maybe I would hear from one or

69
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,090
two people it was really no big deal I

70
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,260
was just gonna like event my spleen no

71
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:08,070
no so approximately ten thousand

72
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,530
retweets a God knows how many emails

73
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:16,250
later I had a project on my hands and

74
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:19,470
that was no fun so I was getting

75
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,810
somewhere between 0 and 12 contacts a

76
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:23,960
day

77
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,220
mostly made up of people telling me

78
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,139
about the worst thing that had ever

79
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:32,009
happened to them the victims were mostly

80
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:35,430
women the abusers were mostly men but

81
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,409
there were also cases of women abusing

82
00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:41,099
men of abusive same-sex couples

83
00:04:41,099 --> 00:04:44,669
I had one case in which a man came to me

84
00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:49,469
because his ex-boyfriend had outed him

85
00:04:49,469 --> 00:04:51,870
as gay to his extremely conservative

86
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:55,530
Korean family so there were there were

87
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:58,440
all kinds of things that I saw over the

88
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,199
over the course of my let's go with

89
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:08,370
involuntary research and it turns out as

90
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:11,610
as with most research projects that my

91
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,770
original assumptions about what it was

92
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:17,039
that people needed were wrong most

93
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,620
people that came to me were not

94
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,740
suffering from device compromise most

95
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,710
people didn't need forensics sometimes

96
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,389
it was a scam I don't know how many of

97
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:29,789
you are familiar with the emailed scam

98
00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:32,340
going around in which a stranger sends

99
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,139
an email saying I have installed a rat

100
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:36,300
on your machine and I have seen you

101
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,849
masturbating and I have recorded this

102
00:05:38,849 --> 00:05:40,349
and I'm going to send it out to all of

103
00:05:40,349 --> 00:05:43,409
your contacts to your eternal shame this

104
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:44,219
is

105
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,529
it is a scam please don't send that

106
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:50,879
person Bitcoin and so I was contacted by

107
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:52,529
a lot of people who had these things and

108
00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:54,960
just like couldn't they couldn't tell

109
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,830
whether or not this was legitimate most

110
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:01,610
often what I saw was account compromised

111
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:04,469
basically if I had a login it was

112
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:07,169
compromised email Google Drive Facebook

113
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:09,650
Twitter snapchat Instagram whatsapp

114
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:13,020
Apple IDs tik toks I had to figure out

115
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:17,460
what a tick tock was I am an old person

116
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,960
we don't have these things that's like

117
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,979
vying only slightly longer so I spent

118
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:25,830
some time thinking that the problem was

119
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,360
device compromised the problem was not

120
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,300
device compromised it was almost always

121
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,819
account compromised and the good news is

122
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:35,540
that we have advice

123
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,880
for account compromised account

124
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,420
compromise is reasonably well understood

125
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:44,120
and so if someone comes to you and and

126
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,530
says that they're concerned about

127
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,080
account compromised you tell them change

128
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,180
all your passwords use a password

129
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:54,310
manager turn on the highest level of

130
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,690
two-factor authentication that you're

131
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:59,540
comfortable using now I know that I'm

132
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,070
about to get a whole bunch of well

133
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,960
actually's from the audience about how

134
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,130
you should never use SMS 2fa and

135
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,060
everybody should be carrying you the

136
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,320
keys around at all times

137
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:14,510
listen I agree with you I do but I also

138
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,920
believe very strongly in harm reduction

139
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,910
if I am talking to a group of people who

140
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,830
are not comfortable using you the keys

141
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:25,790
or who can't spend 40 or 50 bucks on on

142
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:29,720
a you the key or who can only you know

143
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,020
sort of wrap their mind around 2fa SMS

144
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,700
it is better than nothing

145
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,880
and so following the harm reduction

146
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,340
approach you meet people where they are

147
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,260
not where you think that they should be

148
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,690
and certainly if they're not where you

149
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:45,980
think they should be you don't tell them

150
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,200
well you just don't deserve security

151
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,970
clearly your partner should be able to

152
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,410
spy on you wherever you go and whatever

153
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:57,590
you're doing so the bad news is that

154
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:01,550
sometimes it really is around a very

155
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:04,340
small fraction of the cases that I

156
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:08,660
looked at involved actual rats but they

157
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,070
were also the most disturbing

158
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,320
they were usually the ones that were

159
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:16,460
linked to a long-term harassment to

160
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,490
physical threats to physical violence to

161
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:23,600
kidnapping and all kinds of really

162
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,460
disturbing abuse including weirdly

163
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:31,070
financial abuse and it turns out also

164
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:36,740
the rats were usually not on devices

165
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,830
that hackers had threatened to

166
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,840
compromise because it turns out the

167
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,919
hackers are lazy

168
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,100
and hackers are also usually kind of

169
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,120
cowardly and so often what they would do

170
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,130
is they would threaten to compromise the

171
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,709
device in order to maintain a certain

172
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:57,180
amount of control without actually

173
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,389
having to install a rat but in the cases

174
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:02,699
where a rat was installed usually you

175
00:09:02,699 --> 00:09:04,740
didn't see that kind of threat because

176
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,279
the hacker didn't want to tip his victim

177
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:11,370
off and wants to maintain access so you

178
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,779
don't see that particular type of

179
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:17,279
control there and one thing to note is

180
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,839
that abusers lie about their

181
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:21,959
capabilities all the time it helps keep

182
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:23,670
the victims feeling confused and

183
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,470
powerless when they don't know the shape

184
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,820
and the limits of the abusers

185
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,449
surveillance so here I am looking like

186
00:09:30,449 --> 00:09:35,570
brie Larson hair flowing in the wind and

187
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:39,389
I had so many emails and so many

188
00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:42,899
messages every day from people telling

189
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:43,889
me the worst thing that had ever

190
00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:46,920
happened to them and I just plotted

191
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,610
through it like I was the universe's

192
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:55,230
helpdesk and started to help one person

193
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,420
at a time

194
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:00,959
now this is not efficient this is the

195
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,420
hero model I get to feel very good about

196
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,519
myself because every day there's

197
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,140
somebody who tells me something terrible

198
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,600
I tell them how to fix it they tell me

199
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,149
you know oh you're you're a superhero

200
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:13,110
you're a saint

201
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:17,190
you're brie Larson wired writes up an

202
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:19,740
article about me Fast Company writes up

203
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,810
an article about me I look out into the

204
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:25,170
distance like a thought leader very

205
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:29,760
dramatically lit but the hero model is

206
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:35,640
 being a hero is very satisfying

207
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:40,980
but it doesn't scale I and so I spent

208
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,589
some time thinking about what I could do

209
00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:46,019
that would help more than the people

210
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:50,690
that knew to contact me directly and

211
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:53,819
more than one at a time because helping

212
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,560
one person at a time

213
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,800
is extremely satisfying but a really

214
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,949
good way to end up burnt out I and not

215
00:11:01,949 --> 00:11:09,540
do I don't know the rest of my job so I

216
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,209
engaged in some thought leadership so I

217
00:11:12,209 --> 00:11:13,769
have advice for people who compromised

218
00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:15,329
accounts but the worst abuses that I'm

219
00:11:15,329 --> 00:11:16,800
seeing oh the result of compromised

220
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,809
devices mostly Android phones running

221
00:11:18,809 --> 00:11:21,749
spouse we're in stalker where they were

222
00:11:21,749 --> 00:11:24,720
giving away people's locations the

223
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,939
contents of their emails their text

224
00:11:26,939 --> 00:11:29,569
messages their whatsapp messages photos

225
00:11:29,569 --> 00:11:30,809
snapchats

226
00:11:30,809 --> 00:11:34,589
insta their web browsing searches the

227
00:11:34,589 --> 00:11:38,120
contents of a phone are really revealing

228
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,319
searching somebody's phone is the next

229
00:11:40,319 --> 00:11:42,420
best thing to having access to the

230
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,759
contents of their mind this is one of

231
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:48,029
the reasons why why a PT's find

232
00:11:48,029 --> 00:11:50,699
compromising phones so great for Intel

233
00:11:50,699 --> 00:11:53,249
and this is also the reason why abusers

234
00:11:53,249 --> 00:11:55,589
think that compromising the the phones

235
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:57,990
of their of their former partners or if

236
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:04,069
their victims will get them so much so

237
00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:06,329
this leads us to the next question which

238
00:12:06,329 --> 00:12:09,709
is so how do I know it's spouse where

239
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:12,689
the good news is that it's much easier

240
00:12:12,689 --> 00:12:16,259
to find spouse where then it is to find

241
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:21,540
a state actors malware you can just go

242
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,660
to google and search for it I am as I've

243
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,779
pointed out before extremely lazy and so

244
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:30,089
I was excited to discover that I could

245
00:12:30,089 --> 00:12:32,129
just search for this stuff and pull down

246
00:12:32,129 --> 00:12:34,829
sample after sample after sample so this

247
00:12:34,829 --> 00:12:39,000
is the results of a search for how do I

248
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,629
spy on my girlfriend's phone it's pretty

249
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:44,339
straightforward you just click on all

250
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:47,870
the links download a bunch of packages

251
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:51,529
so again how do I know it's spouse we're

252
00:12:51,529 --> 00:12:56,459
like they will tell you this is from

253
00:12:56,459 --> 00:13:00,509
cocoa spies advertising copy access to

254
00:13:00,509 --> 00:13:02,189
Coco spy gives you the lead on how to

255
00:13:02,189 --> 00:13:04,500
spy on your wife with ease you don't

256
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,360
have to worry about where she goes who

257
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,459
talks to or the websites that she visits

258
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:11,399
or have an actual conversation with her

259
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:15,510
about your relationship and just in case

260
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,160
you didn't think that was creepy enough

261
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,480
oh don't worry

262
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,100
the creepiness goes up to 11 so this is

263
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:28,170
a screenshot from mobile spy mobile

264
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:32,399
spies spy app for personal catch

265
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,700
cheating spouses this is a lengthy

266
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,519
paragraph about how common cheating is

267
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:42,089
in in relationships and why cheating is

268
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:45,329
very bad and this is a photo of a man

269
00:13:45,329 --> 00:13:48,630
who is beating his female partner and

270
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:52,380
there is blood on her face now let's be

271
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:56,820
clear in this photo cocoa Spy is on the

272
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,160
side of the abuser they want you to be

273
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,100
that guy doing that to this woman and

274
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,959
they're selling you a product in order

275
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:10,440
to help make that happen so that brings

276
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,730
us to this guy Jean Pierre Lister there

277
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:17,040
it's actually not a big difference

278
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:22,370
between sort of free easily available

279
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:28,250
rats and stalker where or spouse where

280
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:33,959
so Jung careless sewer was a hacker who

281
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:38,190
went by the name of like that dark comic

282
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,269
coder I

283
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:42,510
and he made dark comic rat which you may

284
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,699
or may not be familiar with it was cheap

285
00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:48,260
it was easy it was ubiquitous and I

286
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,970
spent many years tracking the use of

287
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:54,949
dark comet by a group of pro-assad

288
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:57,570
Syrian hackers who are using it to

289
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:01,649
target opponents of the of the Assad

290
00:15:01,649 --> 00:15:06,769
government now when John Kerr the sewer

291
00:15:06,769 --> 00:15:12,630
read these reports and his his work

292
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:16,589
became synonymous with tracking Syrian

293
00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:18,560
activist

294
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,459
you've shut the project down and one of

295
00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:26,240
the things that that he said was

296
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:31,640
essentially listen when I built this

297
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,649
thing I thought guys were just going to

298
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:36,170
use it to spy on their girlfriends it

299
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,029
didn't occur to me that it was going to

300
00:15:38,029 --> 00:15:41,420
be used by you know murderous hackers in

301
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,370
order to send you know innocent

302
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:47,240
dissidents to torture camps and so what

303
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,560
I'm going to be doing is I'm going to be

304
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,860
shutting this project down what is

305
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:56,480
implied here is the guys spying on their

306
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,920
girlfriends using this route is

307
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,860
perfectly fine and that is really the

308
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:05,839
the notion that we need to change that

309
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,350
is really the most important thing

310
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,880
interestingly enough the wired coverage

311
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,600
of Jean peerless sewers decision to shut

312
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,450
down dark comet was hilariously

313
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:22,149
sympathetic the title of the column the

314
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:25,040
story that Wired wrote about it was how

315
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,529
the boy next door accidentally built a

316
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:31,250
Syrian spy tool sure he accidentally

317
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,870
built a Syrian spy tool but he

318
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:35,209
deliberately built spouse we're in

319
00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:37,940
stalker where he's not the boy next door

320
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:41,360
he's not a good guy if you see this guy

321
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,740
tell him I'm looking for him so again

322
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:48,320
how do you know it spouse we're how do

323
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,510
you know the the software that you're

324
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,700
looking at is not just some sort of

325
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,339
innocent like keep track of your kids

326
00:16:55,339 --> 00:16:58,130
keep track of like everybody in your

327
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,899
family so that you know whether or not

328
00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:01,490
your partner is going to be late for

329
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:02,140
dinner

330
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:07,359
kind of situations and the key here is

331
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,429
deception spouse we're and stalker wear

332
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:14,449
is designed to run invisibly on the

333
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:19,459
victims device and so if the program

334
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:23,589
runs invisibly you can't give consent

335
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:28,069
even if in order to install the

336
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:30,650
the program you need to have the

337
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:34,940
username and password and up until

338
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:37,490
recently most of the companies that I

339
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:41,750
talked to including most most AV and and

340
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:45,020
security companies would tell me that if

341
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:48,440
you have the if you have the login

342
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,840
credentials you have legitimate access

343
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,750
to the device and my reply to them was I

344
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,210
have some news for you about how abuse

345
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,050
works

346
00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:01,810
it was extremely common to see abusers

347
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:04,970
convince their victims to hand over

348
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:07,250
their login credentials in fact this

349
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,220
sort of behavior was routine and that's

350
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:13,880
why we really need to rethink our our

351
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:19,520
definition of this stuff so I did a

352
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,450
little research I went and downloaded

353
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:25,940
all of the most common spouse wear and

354
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,370
stalker wear again very easy because all

355
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,050
you have to do is search for it on the

356
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:31,520
Internet

357
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,790
then I ran the packages through through

358
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:37,910
virustotal almost immediately I think

359
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:41,060
just same-day checking and I discovered

360
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:44,720
that the pickup was very low these are

361
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,710
my results from I think back in April

362
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,300
right here I think this is a result for

363
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:55,520
the truth spy showing a showing that

364
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,350
only seven out of sixty a V products

365
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:03,890
were accurately recognizing this product

366
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:08,990
is malicious here is another one we were

367
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:13,780
seeing 10 out of 61 again not very good

368
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:17,570
and what this means is that even if you

369
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:21,560
had a even if you had the truth spy on

370
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,910
your phone maliciously installed by a by

371
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:30,200
an abusive partner and you had AV e on

372
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,680
your phone it still wouldn't pick it up

373
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,740
so that's useless

374
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:40,400
so back in April I managed to

375
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,150
Vince Kaspersky just start taking stock

376
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,860
aware and spouse we're more seriously

377
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:50,600
and what they did was they added this

378
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,880
sort of capability to their to their

379
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,700
product if you download the Kaspersky

380
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,900
you know mobile mobile AV now if they

381
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,760
run into any of the stalker where a

382
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,380
spouse where you will get this message

383
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:06,290
right here a privacy alert letting you

384
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:09,470
know that that this stuff is malicious

385
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:13,040
and bad and offering to remove it now it

386
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,440
does not remove it automatically one of

387
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,980
the reasons for this is the way that

388
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,650
abuse works it turns out that there are

389
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:24,610
situations in which alerting your abuser

390
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:28,130
to knowing that you are being watched

391
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:30,890
or taking steps to thwart them can

392
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:33,320
sometimes lead them to escalate to

393
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,960
greater violence and I really want to

394
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,530
leave it up to the to the target to the

395
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:45,020
victim the the survivor to decide what

396
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,030
their appetite for risk is instead of

397
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:49,070
making decisions for them because if

398
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,120
there's one thing that I have learned

399
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,950
over the course of this project it is

400
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:55,550
that every assumption I made about who

401
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,410
was the victim about what they needed

402
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:59,000
about what needed to be done and about

403
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,950
what was helpful turned out to be wrong

404
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,990
so the more power that you give them to

405
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:06,160
make their own decisions the better

406
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:10,970
additionally look out put out a a blog

407
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,830
post saying essentially oh we have

408
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:16,430
always done this we have always taken

409
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:18,290
spouse born stalker we're very seriously

410
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:23,540
and you can you can download look out

411
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,310
and it will find all of this stuff for

412
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:29,680
you yay so two down

413
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:33,850
sixty something to go so there's still

414
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:36,340
some work to do but it is my

415
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,020
understanding that the AV industry has

416
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,450
really started to pay attention and the

417
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:42,760
they are looking at adding this sort of

418
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,250
capability to their products which is

419
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,650
really cool because now I will be able

420
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:49,840
to tell people just download antivirus

421
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,820
and you will know whether or not their

422
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,830
spouse where stalker where on your on

423
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:57,640
your device so again what can antivirus

424
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,580
do I antivirus can start detecting

425
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,890
spouse wear and stalker wear label it is

426
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:08,620
malicious and stay on top of it there

427
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,970
also a few things that Google can do

428
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:12,340
Google could do a better job of policing

429
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:16,450
the Google Playstore right now spouse

430
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:19,000
weren't stalker where in the manner that

431
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,620
I describe it stuff which is designed to

432
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:27,670
run invisibly to the user on your device

433
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:31,600
I is not allowed under the Google Play

434
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,870
stores

435
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:36,430
policies but sometimes this stuff sneaks

436
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:38,260
in anyway so Google should really stay

437
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:41,650
on top of it you may also ask yourself

438
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:44,170
what can developers do one of the things

439
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:45,490
that developers can do no matter what

440
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:48,520
product they're building is make it

441
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,720
easier to rule out a rat and pin down

442
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,370
actual account compromised and you could

443
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:56,830
do this by having one page or tab where

444
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,390
the user can see all of the accounts

445
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:00,670
that have access to the data and which

446
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,530
data they have access to you can have

447
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:04,930
one page or tab that allows users to see

448
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:06,580
devices and IP addresses that have

449
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,750
recently brought logged into their

450
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:12,340
account and of course support 2fa again

451
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:15,190
preferably something stronger than SMS I

452
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:17,140
would really really like to see the

453
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:21,430
normalization of not just to IFA but the

454
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:23,590
strongest level of 2fa that you can

455
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:28,840
really convince users to accept which

456
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,760
leads us to the next question what can

457
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,090
government's do so I'm a little

458
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:36,730
skeptical of authority governments I

459
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,080
know that this is going to come as a

460
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,520
terrible surprise to everybody in this

461
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,670
room

462
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:43,120
and so when faced with a problem

463
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,990
frequently people say there ought to be

464
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,480
a law and when I hear there ought to be

465
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,690
a law become very suspicious so let's

466
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:52,580
start by looking at the laws that

467
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:57,260
already exist the following is a US

468
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:00,320
legal analysis because I have a floor of

469
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:05,210
angry us barred attack lawyers in my

470
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,520
office and I do not have a floor of

471
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,910
angry Israeli barred lawyers this is a

472
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:16,910
sort of project for anybody who is who

473
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:19,130
is listening to this talk if you are an

474
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:23,120
attorney a analysis of the laws that

475
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,270
these that these programs are breaking

476
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,830
in your country would be extremely

477
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:31,640
welcome recently citizen lab put out a

478
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,880
put out their own legal analysis of the

479
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,120
laws which are being broken in Canada by

480
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,740
these companies so there's room for

481
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,020
everybody let a thousand angry lawyers

482
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:47,600
bloom and write analyses so US law and

483
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,300
we will go through this fairly quickly

484
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,560
because I imagine US law is not terribly

485
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:55,430
interesting to you there are some

486
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,570
federal laws that are being broken

487
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:58,490
including the federal wiretap Act the

488
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:01,550
stored Communications Act and the

489
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:04,010
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act

490
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:10,070
I am extremely hesitant to use the

491
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:12,770
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act because

492
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:14,180
frequently the Computer Fraud and Abuse

493
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:18,050
Act is the law under which most hackers

494
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:21,700
are prosecuted and it's extremely broad

495
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,530
but there are definitely cases in the

496
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:26,900
use of spyware and stalker where where

497
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,730
it's not a broad reading of the law to

498
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:35,750
go after them so the federal wiretap Act

499
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,670
prohibits the manufacture distribution

500
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,860
possession and advertising of certain

501
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:43,190
intercepting devices it's not limited to

502
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:47,540
the developers of spyware the FWA s

503
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:50,120
prohibitions are quite broad generally

504
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,890
covering the devices that are primarily

505
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:53,590
useful for the purpose of syrup

506
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:56,320
just interception uh not just illegal

507
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,900
surreptitious interception and as a

508
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,000
result even the surreptitious monitoring

509
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,559
of children which may be legal

510
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:09,039
advertising it may may still be illegal

511
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:13,360
and as you can see we've had the

512
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,490
government go after a company called

513
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,039
stealth of Jeannie for this very reason

514
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:20,830
and they were violating the FWA the

515
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:25,270
federal wiretapping Act you can also

516
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:28,480
call in the FTC the Federal Trade

517
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,710
Commission in 2012 the FTC charged

518
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:34,809
designer where LLC a company that

519
00:26:34,809 --> 00:26:36,970
provided spyware to rent-to-own computer

520
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,890
owners and entered into a consent decree

521
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:41,260
with the company agreeing not to collect

522
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,240
data from computers without giving clear

523
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,549
and prominent notice and obtaining

524
00:26:45,549 --> 00:26:50,919
affirmative consent we also have state

525
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:55,539
laws so one of the most annoying things

526
00:26:55,539 --> 00:26:59,080
about US law is that we have laws for we

527
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,610
have federal laws and then we have state

528
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:06,370
laws and we have 50 states with 50

529
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:09,490
different laws for greater confusion I

530
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:13,270
and almost every state I believe has its

531
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:18,070
own wiretapping statute some of the

532
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,779
states have what we call two-party

533
00:27:19,779 --> 00:27:23,440
consent wiretapping laws which is to say

534
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,990
that in states such as California and

535
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:28,840
Maryland you cannot record a

536
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,549
conversation which is happening between

537
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:32,380
two people without the consent of both

538
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:35,350
people which makes spyware and stalker

539
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:38,350
where that records your conversations de

540
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:43,450
facto illegal because the person who who

541
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:45,190
has the stuff installed on their on

542
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:47,440
their phone was not able to consent they

543
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,750
don't know it's on there but also the

544
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,190
person that they're talking to is not

545
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:52,600
able to consent because they're not able

546
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:58,330
to ask them for consent there's also the

547
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:01,240
consumer protection against consumer

548
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:05,590
spyware act a awkwardly named California

549
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:06,640
law

550
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,480
that is specifically designed for for

551
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,600
the purpose of going after spyware so

552
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,390
again the tools exist this is not a

553
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:19,210
situation where we need new laws what we

554
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:22,480
need is for the Department of Justice

555
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,480
and for state attorneys general to start

556
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,700
enforcing the laws that already exist

557
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:31,540
and we need to see greater analysis all

558
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:34,720
over the world of the laws that are

559
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,600
being broken in other countries because

560
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,000
the Internet is global and spouse where

561
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,890
and stalker where and abuse are global

562
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:44,410
and it's not just limited to to the

563
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:46,810
United States so the more lawyers that I

564
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:49,350
can throw at this problem the better and

565
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:53,290
finally I just want to remind everybody

566
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:57,910
that I didn't invent the terms stalker

567
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:01,510
wear or spouse wear I don't do this work

568
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:05,170
in a vacuum I it is only possible for me

569
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:07,870
to do this work because so many people

570
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:12,150
did research before me that includes the

571
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,920
journalists at motherboard who have a

572
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:19,080
series called when when spies come home

573
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,120
who did a lot of the research that that

574
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:25,330
my work is based on Thomas Brewster at

575
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:28,930
Forbes did a lot of this work Chris Cox

576
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:31,150
has done an enormous amount of work

577
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:35,980
Harlow Holmes who works for the freedom

578
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,320
of press foundation has been doing a lot

579
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,530
of the sort of one-on-one hero work that

580
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,660
I was talking about earlier helping

581
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:47,410
women individually and without them I

582
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,330
would have essentially had to reinvent

583
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:51,700
the wheel I'd also like to give a shout

584
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:55,120
out to citizen lab for their for their

585
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,460
Canadian analysis of the laws that are

586
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,500
already being broken I think that that

587
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:03,100
stuff is extremely important and I would

588
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,770
like to give a shout out to Dave Moss

589
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:08,230
and Cooper Quinton who are my co-workers

590
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:11,980
at ya FF the right lab who supported me

591
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:14,890
all through my research and last of all

592
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:16,720
I want to give a shout out to you guys

593
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,040
because

594
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,130
somebody has to build on this research

595
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:22,060
somebody's gonna have to do with legal

596
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,160
analysis somebody's gonna have to go and

597
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,170
make the cases at the AV companies

598
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:28,240
somebody's gonna have to show up when

599
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,040
somebody makes a new product and say

600
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,650
well let's talk about the domestic abuse

601
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:36,100
case and what I'm hoping is that it's

602
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,990
going to be you thank you very much

603
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:50,839
[Applause]
