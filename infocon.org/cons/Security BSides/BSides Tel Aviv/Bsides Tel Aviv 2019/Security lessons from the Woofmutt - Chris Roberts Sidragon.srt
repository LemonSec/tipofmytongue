1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,149
assuming you want those oh hell yes what

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:04,620
is it do I ask I don't know

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,639
sell it Cheers mmm I'm not I'm just this

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,050
is getting drunker too civilized right

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,429
oh this is good

6
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:18,810
all right no don't do that I've got

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,490
little weapons that I can have fun with

8
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,439
I better shut up I'm gonna wait Kelly no

9
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,050
do not drink all the damn whiskey all

10
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:25,890
right I'll keep talking all right we're

11
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,970
gonna little bit of fun this is a

12
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,009
completely different talk I've I've

13
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:35,430
showed me down for here and it's

14
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,930
something that's non-technical and we'll

15
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,550
go through some second in a minute so

16
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,770
how many of you don't know who the heck

17
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,350
I am on this one a couple so yeah put

18
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,680
your bloody hand down so some general

19
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,989
talking notes I do come with a warning

20
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:51,960
label mostly on certain airlines

21
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,370
I am always distracted by shiny things

22
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:57,719
there's a logical reason why the

23
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,100
squirrel is on the screen for the most

24
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,350
of the time as is noted with always I

25
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,579
can normally be bribed with a good

26
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:05,670
scotch no it is not bloody Australian

27
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,760
accent and every now again people make

28
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,900
Welsh jokes and it involves sheep and

29
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,900
stuff

30
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,630
so here is what the talk is about this

31
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:23,759
year recently about a year ago ended up

32
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,360
rescuing a couple of dogs this is Daisy

33
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,380
when we rescued her she's a four year

34
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,780
old she's now five this is Milo the

35
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,810
complete doofus he was four months old

36
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,460
when we rescued him he's just turned a

37
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,600
year Rob the reason I have these

38
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,250
bracelets on is not to look cool

39
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:42,600
I am the chew toy I am the only chew toy

40
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,799
that's allowed and we'll go through the

41
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,750
other stuff this is the snack size dog

42
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,880
that's a hundred and fifty pound now

43
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,610
that's 12 pound like a little chew toys

44
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,159
like uncle and then that was the one

45
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,329
that kicked it all off that was a

46
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:56,579
friend's one that we looked at now why

47
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:57,840
the hell are we talking about dogs at a

48
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,840
hacker conference here's the logic this

49
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,909
the world around us arguably is broken

50
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:05,009
let's be perfectly honest there is

51
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:07,020
nothing that we can't break into there's

52
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,970
nothing that we can't hack and there's

53
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,619
very little that keeps us out of

54
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:13,079
absolutely anything so what do we tend

55
00:02:13,079 --> 00:02:14,579
to do well we talk about this all

56
00:02:14,579 --> 00:02:16,860
the damn time and it's great and we

57
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,599
stand up and go hey look I broke shedded

58
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,549
sky like all know actually how about we

59
00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:22,859
fix it for a problem but this isn't

60
00:02:22,859 --> 00:02:25,350
about the technology and isn't about the

61
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:28,889
industry today well this is and I'll put

62
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:30,660
a disclaimer in here if you're looking

63
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,980
for me to stand up and talk about

64
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,079
basically turning ships over and talk to

65
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,970
me afterwards about that we'll talk

66
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,620
about how to go to SATCOM to navigation

67
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,720
to the ballast control system of

68
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,920
shipping if anybody feels like having

69
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,079
some fun with that but this isn't that

70
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:46,859
talk this is a human talk and it's kind

71
00:02:46,859 --> 00:02:49,859
of started off with me in the last 12

72
00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:51,420
months taking a bit of an introspective

73
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,850
look at myself partly because of the

74
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:56,609
dogs and partly because I'm just some

75
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:58,079
other stuff that's going on in life and

76
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:00,269
what I'm up to and quite honestly I sat

77
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:02,970
down and I came up with these I'm broken

78
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:07,380
I ually he had a lot of ugly arguably

79
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,299
quite honestly a lot of us are probably

80
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:11,430
feeling this way a lot of us in the

81
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,280
industry are feeling this way especially

82
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,720
those of us who have maybe got the extra

83
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,660
odd bit of gray hair or two and the

84
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,430
challenge on it his most of us don't

85
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,290
like the idea of somebody analyzing us

86
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,209
most of us don't like the fact that

87
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:25,680
somebody's going to come and ask us all

88
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,849
sorts of interesting questions that

89
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:27,620
maybe

90
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,290
we don't necessarily want to answer so

91
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,390
then the challenges is what do we want

92
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:35,000
what do we need and how do we actually

93
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,440
take that from an internal conversation

94
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,690
to something else for me

95
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:43,069
this is what I came up with now there's

96
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:46,040
a caveat that gums with this getting a

97
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,769
dog the reason to get a dog is just a

98
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:50,780
cuddle bunny is not a very good reason

99
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,700
to get a dog especially if you end up

100
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,640
getting Great Danes they poo the size of

101
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,019
mountains and they do it regularly and

102
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:01,519
you have to get a service to clean it up

103
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,810
and they eat more than we do all the

104
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,780
time and maybe boom or the other thing

105
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,970
as well I've got a family I've got a

106
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:14,060
daughter my fight with my inner demons

107
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,190
is not her thing that she has to worry

108
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,370
about I don't need her to be concerned

109
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,988
about that only the rest of the tribe to

110
00:04:20,988 --> 00:04:22,789
be concerned about this is stuff I need

111
00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:25,520
to figure out and the same thing if I go

112
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,650
woof mutts I travel a lot I put people

113
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:29,270
in place to help out with this etcetera

114
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:33,349
etcetera so let's take a look at the

115
00:04:33,349 --> 00:04:35,630
lessons I've learned from the dog's

116
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:38,510
perspective over the last 12 months some

117
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:43,400
interesting stuff truth be true to who

118
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,610
we really are this is something as an

119
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,050
industry we're not very good at doing

120
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,729
and it's something when we talk to

121
00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:51,500
organizations and companies that we're

122
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,270
not good at doing from a woof mutts

123
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:57,080
perspective there's no hiding they will

124
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,180
look straight into your soul so the

125
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,860
argument sometimes is when you look in

126
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,789
the mirror and when you project

127
00:05:01,789 --> 00:05:03,710
yourselves out to organizations and

128
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,199
companies how can you hold that truth to

129
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:09,949
who you actually are other things I

130
00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:11,240
learn this is great

131
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,669
I am off the regime that jumps off the

132
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:15,800
cliff and figures out on the way

133
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,470
down I'd argue that some of us in the

134
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:21,289
room are the same way but sometimes you

135
00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:25,270
do want to actually look before you leap

136
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:30,549
point encase don't tweet on aeroplanes

137
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,240
we all talk about human and social

138
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,740
engineering but there are some amazing

139
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,300
people out there I mean you've got

140
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,590
Nickerson you a hag Nadia there's

141
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,090
probably some fantastic people here as

142
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:45,479
well but my good grief some of the best

143
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:48,030
social engineers I now have is a hundred

144
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,060
and fifty pound slobbering puppy I'm

145
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,380
pretty sure if I took them on some more

146
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,699
of the engagements we have I can

147
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:55,320
probably get into absolutely anything I

148
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,360
want to because it's like who are that's

149
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,120
so cute as you walk into they're

150
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,770
building something else that I've

151
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,440
watched and observed this is snow I

152
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,949
don't know if you get this here no I

153
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:13,860
figured as much all you get you get

154
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,870
moisture in the air and it just stays in

155
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,669
the bloody air and then attaches to the

156
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:23,009
clothing this is the first time Milo saw

157
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:25,889
snow he came out of the back door out of

158
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:28,680
the kitchen and went at full speed into

159
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,229
the garden after the first ten yards he

160
00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:32,849
opened his mouth and he was like a snow

161
00:06:32,849 --> 00:06:35,669
plow and it was head down high through

162
00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:37,110
the snow to try and figure out what the

163
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,659
hell this stuff was and just kept on

164
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:44,039
truckin in human language it's all about

165
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:46,669
trying new and different things as

166
00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:49,260
hackers we're very good sometimes

167
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,190
they're doing that but there are other

168
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:52,620
times when we tend to take a step back

169
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,930
and we get very comfortable in who we

170
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:57,349
are what we are and we don't necessarily

171
00:06:57,349 --> 00:06:59,780
experience or we don't want to embrace

172
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,550
different experiences my challenge here

173
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,860
is challenge yourselves to do differ

174
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,729
I'll make sure these slides are

175
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:07,889
available I will however the hell I need

176
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:09,030
to get them out there I'll make sure

177
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:13,470
they're there for folks this this bugger

178
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,840
has decided that my Vibrams make a good

179
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,870
chew toy when they were on the ground in

180
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,120
that room I closed the door he figured

181
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,949
out how to open the thing so I put the

182
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:24,570
Vibrams up on a shelf he figured out how

183
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,370
to get up to the shelf then I put him up

184
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:28,800
to the top and then one day I heard this

185
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,750
almighty crash because he'd managed to

186
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,150
basically balance himself on one shelf

187
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,220
and then turn and try to jump up and

188
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,620
turn the entire Vibram pile on him head

189
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:43,620
this is the result again sometimes in

190
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,729
life we don't

191
00:07:44,729 --> 00:07:47,490
necessarily want the failure but there's

192
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,319
some times we have to keep trying and

193
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:51,180
keep trying and keep trying and this is

194
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,520
my way of saying I look at him and I go

195
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,999
you know not a bad way of doing it this

196
00:07:56,999 --> 00:08:01,759
is another one communications we are

197
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,460
good at communicating amongst ourselves

198
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,569
we're not necessarily good at

199
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,490
communicating to businesses and to

200
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,589
people around us and I'm not just

201
00:08:10,589 --> 00:08:12,089
talking about technical things I'm

202
00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:15,059
talking about life in general so how can

203
00:08:15,059 --> 00:08:17,430
we learn to be better at communication

204
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,009
dogs are simple wet-nosed a six o'clock

205
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:22,490
in the morning means you need to feed me

206
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:25,680
wet nose at midday means feed me again

207
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,270
wet nose at 6:00 o'clock means you

208
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:30,029
bloody well late feed me again it's

209
00:08:30,029 --> 00:08:30,719
simple

210
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,458
by the door I don't bother with the dog

211
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,110
we've got a dog door that I can fit

212
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:36,779
through they can come in and out but

213
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:39,809
simple easy communications now for those

214
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:41,490
of us that have the military background

215
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:42,899
there is another way of actually dealing

216
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:44,930
with communications which is this one

217
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,279
quite professional but always have a

218
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,490
plan to kill everybody this one is what

219
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:55,730
I love seize the moment this dumbass

220
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:58,980
decided to play fetch and fight with an

221
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,769
old cardboard tube the dog was like hey

222
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:03,630
that cardboard tube used to be inside a

223
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,160
toll I can just help myself to the

224
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,230
toilet rolls which is exactly what he

225
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,540
did dude the toilet rolls to get to the

226
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,769
car but you didn't care about the paper

227
00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:12,889
stuff wanted the cardboard out of it

228
00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:15,750
took an opportunity seize the

229
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,470
opportunity owned the opportunity and

230
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:21,750
then went with it in life we don't

231
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,120
always do that sometimes we are a little

232
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,050
too cautious responsibility this one's a

233
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:33,449
biggie we all screw up I am the poster

234
00:09:33,449 --> 00:09:37,170
child for screwing up I have been yelled

235
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,149
at by feds I've been yelled at by things

236
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:40,620
I've done good with companies I've

237
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,050
screwed up companies my job is to help

238
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,899
you figure out not to make the same

239
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:50,160
bloody mistakes all of us in here need

240
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,620
to do the same thing as you run into a

241
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,410
mistake as you screw it up tell people

242
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:58,240
around you it's the way we

243
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,140
learn talking about people around you be

244
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:07,060
yourself I turn up with a blue beard a

245
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,970
freakin killed and vibrance I am a hot

246
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:13,510
mess and I don't care I'm comfortable

247
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:18,089
and I'm happy be true to who you are

248
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:23,050
think about that adhere to that now this

249
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,760
is the big one because even though

250
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,140
you've explained to the dog you'd rather

251
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,970
they didn't you up all the time

252
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:31,300
occasionally they still do it from our

253
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,310
standpoint in our industry this whole

254
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,660
get a plan is something that

255
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,950
unfortunately we're not used to and

256
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:38,290
we're not good at communicating what

257
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:41,320
happens when something goes wrong we

258
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,029
know it from the incident response plan

259
00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:44,440
how many of you are an incident response

260
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,570
where you walk in here ie show me all

261
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,160
your logs and they're like you know we

262
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:55,930
wish we had some of those so that's from

263
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,490
the dogs perspective let's take a look

264
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,709
at it from the human's perspective this

265
00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:01,800
one is a biggie

266
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,360
we have three dogs two piggies and the

267
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,800
small snack sized one accordingly

268
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,870
they'll think that the same size they'll

269
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,579
act the same way when people come into

270
00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:11,829
the house they very quickly size them up

271
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:13,270
and they're either happy or they sit

272
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,649
there and they will not take their eyes

273
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:17,730
off of them but for me the big thing is

274
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:20,620
we all need to be better accepting

275
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:24,940
everybody for who they are look past the

276
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:29,589
color the face and everything else this

277
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:30,850
is a biggie we're at a security

278
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,079
conference we know that there are

279
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,640
challenges freaking respect boundaries

280
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:40,649
it's all I'm going to say about that one

281
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:46,990
this my dog doesn't care I have a

282
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,370
whiskey tasting of the house like every

283
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:49,630
six to eight weeks and I got people over

284
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:52,779
all shapes sizes colors orientations I

285
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:53,680
don't give a

286
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,110
none of you should none of us in this

287
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:59,500
industry should dogs don't whine oh hell

288
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,550
don't we learn from them more

289
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:07,500
effectively this one's the biggie for me

290
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,760
non-verbal communication this doesn't

291
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,649
just go to social engineering

292
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:14,529
goes to reading people around you this

293
00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:17,439
one has helped me a lot when I'm talking

294
00:12:17,439 --> 00:12:18,939
to industry and I'm talking to people

295
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:20,399
around me and I'm trying to explain

296
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,139
what's going on what's happening how are

297
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:25,930
we doing the whole concept of nonverbal

298
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:29,439
communication came home to me Daisy she

299
00:12:29,439 --> 00:12:30,759
was about four years old when we got her

300
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:33,519
I can't explain to her that she's in a

301
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,910
safe place now she has I have to listen

302
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,439
to her cues that she doesn't give me

303
00:12:38,439 --> 00:12:40,540
after watch the ears the nose the tail

304
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,179
the fur everything I had to learn an

305
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:46,720
entire different language each one of

306
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,600
you in business and in industry should

307
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,149
learn these nonverbal communication cues

308
00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:57,730
it will help you immeasurably get a dog

309
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:00,249
and learn from them as well how many of

310
00:13:00,249 --> 00:13:02,350
you've got dogs or kids it's kind of the

311
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:04,269
same thing really at some point

312
00:13:04,269 --> 00:13:06,100
awesome you although you can't cage kids

313
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,939
all the time not all the time sometimes

314
00:13:09,939 --> 00:13:13,929
this one I am useless at and I'm trying

315
00:13:13,929 --> 00:13:16,839
to get better and all of us probably

316
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:18,370
need to improve a little bit more on

317
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:22,240
this one I can be ruled by emotion my

318
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,980
emotions on a regular basis but

319
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,319
sometimes we do need to sit down and

320
00:13:26,319 --> 00:13:29,679
figure out why take that moment take

321
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:32,920
that pause and actually respect those

322
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,860
thoughts so and down to a minute so

323
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,759
we're running through these we're

324
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:39,490
running through them good the heart of

325
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:42,730
the matter what do we care about this

326
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:49,569
for me holy crap never underestimate the

327
00:13:49,569 --> 00:13:52,209
need for a bloody good hug that twenty

328
00:13:52,209 --> 00:13:57,569
seconds of being smothered basically I

329
00:13:57,569 --> 00:14:01,029
can't explain it I come back from a trip

330
00:14:01,029 --> 00:14:03,249
I come back from a crappy system I get

331
00:14:03,249 --> 00:14:06,069
to hug the wolf mud we each need to find

332
00:14:06,069 --> 00:14:08,920
what it takes for us to take a step away

333
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,290
from the world sometimes it's music

334
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,029
sometimes in my case it's the wolf mud

335
00:14:13,029 --> 00:14:15,279
each of you needs to find something

336
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,790
where you can take that step away I do a

337
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:21,160
lot of diving and I go there's a lake I

338
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,559
go to in the US where we got a house and

339
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:24,980
I'll just hang out on the

340
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,870
water for a couple of hours that's

341
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:30,050
another quiet place for me so each of

342
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:32,029
you I urge you especially given the

343
00:14:32,029 --> 00:14:33,829
complexities of this world that we have

344
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:35,779
in the craziness that most of us are in

345
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:39,380
find that happy time running low on time

346
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,660
alright this how many of you actually

347
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:48,430
think you get enough sleep yeah alright

348
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,360
I'm in the same boat

349
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:56,180
I suck at it this I I mean a he doesn't

350
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,860
fit in the chair but he manages to fit

351
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,980
in the chair we have to get better at

352
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,889
looking after ourselves we suck at it

353
00:15:03,889 --> 00:15:05,930
but we've got to get away if we can't

354
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,600
look after ourselves how the hell are we

355
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,449
meant to look after those around us our

356
00:15:11,449 --> 00:15:14,959
job as security people is to look after

357
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,899
the charges that we are responsible for

358
00:15:17,899 --> 00:15:20,300
inside organizations that mill aside the

359
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,389
dog off site it's our job we have to do

360
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:25,339
a better job of it because you know what

361
00:15:25,339 --> 00:15:27,410
this is how I learn the lesson that is

362
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:30,079
actually a six plus foot beanbag the

363
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,490
daisy's just hanging out on another

364
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:42,440
biggie never ever I mean I can't explain

365
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,089
this one as easy as opposed to begun I

366
00:15:44,089 --> 00:15:46,040
don't know we all need to treat each

367
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,540
other with a little bit more respect and

368
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,360
a hell of a lot more compassion I can't

369
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,040
explain this one more this one's the

370
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,510
interesting when nothing's forever live

371
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:56,750
every single moment we in this industry

372
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,329
have a hell of an attrition rate it's

373
00:15:59,329 --> 00:16:01,730
not good it's not helping us and we need

374
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,649
to get better at figuring out how we can

375
00:16:03,649 --> 00:16:04,910
actually help each other more

376
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:07,430
effectively and from my standpoint I

377
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:08,750
look at the dogs

378
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,819
Daisy has maybe a seven to eight year

379
00:16:10,819 --> 00:16:13,069
life expectancy I chose awesome big dogs

380
00:16:13,069 --> 00:16:14,839
because I can wrestle with them but it

381
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:16,550
freaking sucks because their life span

382
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:19,880
is so short my job and my responsibility

383
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,680
is to give that animal the best life it

384
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,870
possibly can for as long as you possibly

385
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:24,470
can

386
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:28,250
our roles is to look after each other

387
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,529
and help each other and make sure that

388
00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:33,110
all of those around us have the same

389
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:35,410
attitude

390
00:16:36,699 --> 00:16:40,059
turn the electronics off

391
00:16:40,059 --> 00:16:46,969
sometimes step away and enjoy life says

392
00:16:46,969 --> 00:16:48,139
the people sitting there with their

393
00:16:48,139 --> 00:16:54,909
electronics on yeah working on it

394
00:16:54,909 --> 00:16:56,659
reality check

395
00:16:56,659 --> 00:16:59,719
I'm almost there they're worse things in

396
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:02,329
life the muddy paws I learned this one

397
00:17:02,329 --> 00:17:03,799
first time that the dogs came racing

398
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:05,419
through a muddy paws oh my god Mike oh

399
00:17:05,419 --> 00:17:07,609
 now I just don't care I put the

400
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,169
rumbles on I tell the girl fetch the

401
00:17:09,169 --> 00:17:13,429
muddy paws stuff during uncertainty I'll

402
00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:15,289
run through this one this one is a big

403
00:17:15,289 --> 00:17:17,929
one appreciate life sometimes we all

404
00:17:17,929 --> 00:17:19,759
have to stop and basically smell the

405
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:21,319
roses or in the dogs case smell the fire

406
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:26,269
hydrant again a six and a half foot sofa

407
00:17:26,269 --> 00:17:28,159
so let's wrap it all up very quickly

408
00:17:28,159 --> 00:17:32,779
this has to be our future it's gonna

409
00:17:32,779 --> 00:17:35,330
take all of us it isn't just a security

410
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:37,730
problem a safety problem it isn't it's

411
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,320
going to take all of us to solve the

412
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,179
issues and challenges we have therefore

413
00:17:41,179 --> 00:17:43,399
we all have to work more effectively

414
00:17:43,399 --> 00:17:46,730
together communicate more effectively

415
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:49,100
work more effectively you get the idea

416
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,100
why because this is the one breaking the

417
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,539
 is easy figure out how to fix it so

418
00:17:55,539 --> 00:18:00,350
I like this one we're all in this

419
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,690
together we don't have an option we

420
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:04,220
don't have a choice get over it

421
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,529
figure out how to work more effectively

422
00:18:06,529 --> 00:18:09,259
together and figure out how to look

423
00:18:09,259 --> 00:18:11,419
after each other please it's gonna take

424
00:18:11,419 --> 00:18:16,820
all of us because this is how it is we

425
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:20,029
can't do this as individuals we can do

426
00:18:20,029 --> 00:18:24,139
this if we work together so I managed to

427
00:18:24,139 --> 00:18:25,580
do it in a little bit more than 15

428
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,369
minutes as always to Douglas Adams quote

429
00:18:28,369 --> 00:18:30,649
as I said not a technical conversation

430
00:18:30,649 --> 00:18:33,139
but very much one we need to think about

431
00:18:33,139 --> 00:18:34,970
as humans there's a whole set of

432
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:37,070
discussions at Def Con that are talking

433
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:39,919
about mental health please pay attention

434
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,830
to them look after yourself please look

435
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,809
after those around you look after the

436
00:18:44,809 --> 00:18:46,669
family that we are we're little

437
00:18:46,669 --> 00:18:48,980
dysfunctional as a family but this is a

438
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:49,880
family

439
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,710
look after each other and with that

440
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:53,650
thank you very very much

441
00:18:53,650 --> 00:19:01,859
[Applause]
