1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,570
okay everyone please take a seat I want

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,120
to take this time an opportunity to tell

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,799
you a bit about our capture the flag

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:10,530
event which was concluded this last

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,950
Friday

6
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:16,859
okay so unlike many other city of events

7
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:18,990
our CTF are besides Tel Aviv CTF is a

8
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:19,680
bit different

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,699
we aim to host the CTF that is a full

10
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:25,949
community wide in scale but we would

11
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:28,380
like to give an opportunity to everybody

12
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,410
to take part and participate in the game

13
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,050
so when we plan the game when we planed

14
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,120
the CTF we try to have a variety of

15
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,309
challenges that are be fitting many

16
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:40,350
different skill levels we know that we

17
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,910
expect that only the best of the best

18
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,040
would reach the end the final stages of

19
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,430
the CTF however our greatest metric to

20
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,809
understand the success success of our

21
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:50,989
CTF is how many people actually

22
00:00:50,989 --> 00:00:53,340
succeeded in solving the easier parts of

23
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,930
our CTF so we designed about not about

24
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,359
this specifically 29 different

25
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:02,489
challenges and some of these chances

26
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:03,930
were pretty different and unique this

27
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,710
year and I'll mention them in a bit

28
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,090
first I would like to say thank you and

29
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,250

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,490
long night into developing the most

34
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,659
vicious the most hateful the most

35
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:32,880
unbearably unimaginable challenges to

36
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,009
make the life of everybody as bitter as

37
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:37,470
they can and from the experience of

38
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,060
people who shared it as you can go into

39
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,770
the center of the screen so everybody

40
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,060
can take a picture of you and you'll be

41
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,729
as embarrassed as possible pleased

42
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:48,570
embarrassment this way okay a big round

43
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,990
of applause

44
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:57,789
so these are the guys and girls actually

45
00:01:57,789 --> 00:02:00,039
made everything happen they invested

46
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:01,810
their time their effort their energy

47
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,030
their tears the blood into making those

48
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,310
challenges that great changes that you

49
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,288
had the chance to play so thank you

50
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:22,510
again and now continue so we had an

51
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:25,150
amazing CTF this year and I well I'm a

52
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,130
bit biased but I still think it was an

53
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,549
amazing city of this year we had over

54
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:32,530
300 different teams participating in the

55
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,209
game and we did something a bit

56
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:35,500
differently this year which I would like

57
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,510
to explain yeah we didn't limit the

58
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,790
number of players on each team but we

59
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,890
wanted to encourage people to play as a

60
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:44,590
team in order to share knowledge share

61
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,209
information and create a more cohesive

62
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:48,700
group of players among themselves so we

63
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,280
had teams as large as 12 or 14 different

64
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,200
people on the same team but we also had

65
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,260
team of one person so all of them are

66
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,880
considered teams and all of them played

67
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:04,480
and they played very very well we had 29

68
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,489
challenges and we structured it in a way

69
00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:09,850
that the city have lasted 10 days and in

70
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,980
those 10 days 19 challenges were

71
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,079
released and they were all open to play

72
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:16,120
at the same time so the logic behind

73
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,700
that was that you get nine days not ten

74
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,560
nine days to play all of the different

75
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,019
there 19 challenges so when you get to

76
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:25,030
the final day the top three teams the

77
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,340
top three teams scored the most will get

78
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,200
access to a very special challenge that

79
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,940
we designed called Magic Kingdom and

80
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,950
Magic Kingdom was a bit different in the

81
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,380
world of CTFs usually in the city f you

82
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,850
get a challenge which is kind of like a

83
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,489
riddle there is a specific thing to

84
00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:41,380
answer a specific rhythm to answer to

85
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,950
and the solution to that riddle will get

86
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,260
you the points so in Magic Kingdom we

87
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,209
did something a bit different we hosted

88
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:50,950
three different live as your

89
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,900
environments including Active Directory

90
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,569
and many other servers with a jump box

91
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:58,269
for with credentials for specific three

92
00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:01,150
teams so that could go inside that live

93
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,500
environment and

94
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,600
Kawai at that light with Marmon using

95
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,670
whatever tools whatever they deem

96
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:09,250
necessary narrator in order to make that

97
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,930
happen and this is a bit different

98
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,900
because we didn't give them any

99
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,490
preconditions or any ideas where the

100
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,738
flags are going to be hidden they had to

101
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:19,660
explore the network to find the servers

102
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,730
to find the boys necessities on those

103
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,500
servers kind of like in a Red Team

104
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,500
exercise and then exploit them as best

105
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,240
they can in order to reach those flags

106
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,180
so 19's were ordinary well kind of like

107
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:37,240
ordinary CTF events but the Magic

108
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,340
Kingdom had ten different flags in a

109
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,160
hugely weird environment that most

110
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,200
serious players are not used to we

111
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,370
really took them out of their comfort

112
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,640
zone we had a couple of unique

113
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,380
challenges and when I say unique I mean

114
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,060
that in most city F that you will

115
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,340
participate in or read about you will

116
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:58,290
not find this kind of managed challenges

117
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:01,780
so before we and I'll give you some more

118
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:04,510
information about that our ratio we had

119
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,940
a lot of discussions into how many

120
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,740
points to give into what kind of

121
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,210
challenges how to differentiate between

122
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,070
the challenges how to make sure that the

123
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,660
easy ones are easy and the hard ones are

124
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,460
hard and in the end we came up with this

125
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:20,470
ratio if we hear that they cried and

126
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:23,020
they cried a lot that means it deserves

127
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,360
a lot of points and if it was easy and

128
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,640
no tears were involved well it's only a

129
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,040
hundred points nobody cares so most of

130
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,740
our challenges and a high score pal a

131
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,470
high score point because of this because

132
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,970
it caused a lot of Tears a lot of

133
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:40,800
sleepless nights and we're not sorry

134
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,450
the first unique challenge that I want

135
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:46,840
to mention here is blockchain so we had

136
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,970
the challenge that is focused on hacking

137
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,460
blockchain hacking etherium in order to

138
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,729
find a race condition just like the

139
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:56,620
hacks that were in the news relatively

140
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,870
recently so that was quite a unique

141
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,760
change you don't see that very common

142
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,500
thank you very much Nimrod for this

143
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,100
awesome challenge

144
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,800
we also had an amazing challenge made by

145
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:17,169
Rory here that in order to get the flag

146
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:18,940
you had to capture a file you had to

147
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:22,810
dismantle it decode it into whatever it

148
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:24,610
was encoded with and in the end you get

149
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,770
a file and then he had to 3d print the

150
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,810
file in order to get the object and on

151
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:30,700
the object you would find the flag so it

152
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:37,960
was absolutely awesome and crazy also

153
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,910
special thanks to guy who could not be

154
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:41,410
here with us today not me

155
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:45,340
guy be and a different guy be and here

156
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,139
we actually had a challenge that was

157
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:49,690
based on a zero-day that he found which

158
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:51,639
was always awesome to give people change

159
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:53,800
on something nobody ever heard of or

160
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,729
nobody ever found

161
00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:56,800
so this Lua challenge in Lua bass

162
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,050
challenge was about issues in the Lua

163
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,900
parser that you had to exploit and I

164
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,850
believe that a lot of people let's call

165
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,889
it had a lot of fun with a Bowser set of

166
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:07,660
challenges so a round of applause for

167
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,190
guy he will see it on the recording

168
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:17,350
later ok so here's a brief review of our

169
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,600
challenges I'm not going to go over them

170
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,850
one by one but we had a very large

171
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:24,490
variety we had a specific challenge

172
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:29,220
around the hacking dose 3.1 was a tonal

173
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,780
three-point-three environment which you

174
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:34,840
don't really see quite often today we

175
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:39,940
had a translation it was called a secret

176
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,919
service a necessary issue in a

177
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:42,850
translation service

178
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:46,000
where's Daniel Daniel over there an

179
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,680
awesome challenge that really got a lot

180
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,320
of groups hung up for a while until they

181
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,810
understood what the point was and and

182
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,550
this is a specific challenge as was

183
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,320
challenged I want to say something a bit

184
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,289
about that so the some stuff is

185
00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:01,630
important challenge was conceived to be

186
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,550
relatively easy challenge and in the

187
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,590
initial discussions we wanted to give it

188
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:08,919
a hundred points however when people

189
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:10,419
actually attempted to solve the

190
00:08:10,419 --> 00:08:13,300
challenge we found that no one was able

191
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,880
to solve it and then only one or two

192
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,770
will are able to solve it and that we'd

193
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,840
like five solve six source of

194
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,880
so the idea behind this challenge was

195
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,440
that you need to enumerate all of the

196
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,980
different cipher suites in the SSL

197
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,020
server that was part of the challenge

198
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,420
however if you use the wrong tool or if

199
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,820
you actually didn't enumerate all of the

200
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:34,809
possibilities

201
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:36,640
you only get part of the flags which

202
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,380
cause a lot of frustration to many many

203
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,870
teams so Thank You Ezra for an awesome

204
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:48,280
challenge and we had a very nice

205
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,110
challenge by the mode called Buchman I'm

206
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,030
going to refer to it later please keep

207
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,880
that in mind I want to say something

208
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,380
about my challenge

209
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,560
Faiza there at the top that was an

210
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,390
interesting challenge it came up for an

211
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,680
idea from a different conference called

212
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,390
blue hat that was earlier this year and

213
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:07,360
one of the talks there the tanta battle

214
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,580
how would you go and break something

215
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,500
we'll all you have in the API is the way

216
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,540
to read hash pieces of memory you can't

217
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:16,420
really read access the mirror itself so

218
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,040
the vulnerability that they discuss was

219
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,750
that there you could read memory with an

220
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,730
arbitrary length so once you understood

221
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,830
that you can build a lookup table and

222
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,620
solve the entire challenge so I really

223
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,940
loved the idea I really loved the

224
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,500
concept I love the work that they've

225
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,480
done so I built a challenge around that

226
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,790
and that was a lot of fun and everybody

227
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,140
that didn't attend blue hadn't ever

228
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,030
heard of this found this challenge to be

229
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:42,040
a bit formidable so my apologies ok the

230
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,470
challenge of themselves this very nice

231
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,510
screen was one of the captures that some

232
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:48,160
of the team sent us where they found a

233
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,140
vulnerability in our server that's

234
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,370
always nice to know when you're running

235
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:53,440
a live competition that your servers are

236
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,550
vulnerable but also we had a lot of

237
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,960
communication with different teams where

238
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,350
they had issues with connecting issues

239
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:06,040
with understanding issues with actually

240
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,170
conceiving who should they contact and

241
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:10,480
where they should do this but also where

242
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,190
they only solved part of the challenge

243
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,300
and they weren't sure if they solved

244
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,120
everything or just part of it but also

245
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,460
we had some repeated messages with

246
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,020
different groups which I will not name

247
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:24,100
we're six I think different members of

248
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,870
the CTF team got the same kind of

249
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:28,330
messages asking something might be wrong

250
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,040
please check again what you're doing are

251
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,450
you sure something is wrong and isn't

252
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,680
wrong please check again what you're

253
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,100
doing

254
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,770
so in the end it was still solvable the

255
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:38,350
way it is but there and we did find an

256
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:41,110
issue with that challenge and we issued

257
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,510
the fix with dust attack we issued the

258
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:46,270
fix for to clarify some issue around

259
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,630
which emulator we use I'll skip ahead

260
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,130
because I'm running a bit out of time

261
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:53,350
though there are a lot of funny things

262
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:56,860
happening in the background so here you

263
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,490
can see one of the teams that use the

264
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,660
emulation software in order to

265
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,360
understand the 3d printed flag so the

266
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,860
resolution that they got was not high

267
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,780
enough in order to read the flag so they

268
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,220
asked for a recommendation on an

269
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,540
emulation software to solve the

270
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,670
challenge so that was actually pretty

271
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:16,960
funny this is a different story

272
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,640
which was pretty funny around the

273
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,800
challenge called Buckman so in pac-man

274
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,140
we actually had a game called Buckman

275
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,880
live on the server and we got a message

276
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,680
from one of the teams that he was

277
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,600
playing for over in an hour and he can't

278
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,580
reach the level up challenge he can't

279
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,040
reach that level on the game can and I

280
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,170
will freely translate for you I'm inside

281
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,700
the game it's been over an hour I've

282
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,530
been trying to reach level up I don't

283
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,030
understand what I'm missing can I get

284
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:42,760
like the e the smallest hint possible so

285
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,260
as you can see we're pretty laughing

286
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,360
hard and said no you're not supposed to

287
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,770
play the game solve the challenge that

288
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:55,410
was funny ok and now for the winners

289
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:58,060
first of all before we begin again this

290
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,820
year an honorable mention adam donenfeld

291
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,220
and here i would like to move over for a

292
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:06,720
small message that he prepared for us

293
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,920
everyone sorry for not turning up this

294
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,310
year currently in Korea I'm kind of

295
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:19,900
disappointed about myself for not being

296
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,000
a little bit more prepared for the Magic

297
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,810
Kingdom series it wasn't really easy to

298
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:33,850
do that everyone sorry for not turning

299
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:37,450
up this year currently in Korea I'm kind

300
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,279
of disappointed about myself for being a

301
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,170
little bit more prepared for the Magic

302
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:44,980
Kingdom series it wasn't really easy to

303
00:12:44,980 --> 00:13:02,320
do and now for the winners third place

304
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,370
earnest and young please send a

305
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:08,320
representative to stage so we can mock

306
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,380
him all together

307
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,380
ey

308
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:17,520
[Applause]

309
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,620
so you I had a very large team and they

310
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,290
ruled the game up to I think the eighth

311
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:26,560
day and then other teams passing by on

312
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,510
the other hand they did awesome

313
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,760
challenges and it's almost everything on

314
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:40,290
the first day so hurry to them thank you

315
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:42,260
second place JCPS

316
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,590
[Music]

317
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:47,879
[Applause]

318
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:50,940
so JC TF is one of the most awesome

319
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,730
teams also many intel representatives

320
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:56,640
there are also hiring thank you to the

321
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,760
JCPS team also a very very strong group

322
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:18,690
thank you okay first place done okay

323
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:21,149
done here won first place which means

324
00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:22,920
that he gets a very special portion of

325
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,709
embarrassment for him first of all thank

326
00:14:25,709 --> 00:14:27,899
you very much done for single-handedly

327
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:38,820
beating everybody else so first of all

328
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,279
first place you win a switch but the

329
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:46,560
most important thing you win the besides

330
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,859
Cup

331
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:57,080
