00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,689
[Applause]

2
00:00:02,689 --> 00:00:05,689
Cheers

3
00:00:12,469 --> 00:00:14,610
okay let's get started

4
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,680
my name is amica Schumann this is you

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,869
Val Ron and we're here to talk about

6
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:21,300
Alexa and Cortana in Windows length so

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,000
it's a great opportunity to show how we

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,189
take a partnership between two companies

9
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:30,260
and then use it to hack into computers

10
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:35,190
Wow and we'll use this opportunity to

11
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,469
show you some more cool tricks on how to

12
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:41,280
take over locked Windows machine using

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,340
just your voice at system so as I said

14
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,110
my name is Amica Schumann eval Ron is

15
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,320
with me the homework was done with

16
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,270
Professor LED m from the Technion and

17
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:56,250
what we'll do today would give a quick

18
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,829
introduction into Cortana give you some

19
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:00,660
context about the research work that

20
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,570
we've been doing for the past two years

21
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,860
talk a little bit about the previous

22
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,689
results from this research and then

23
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:08,939
concentrate on the new result which is

24
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:11,010
mostly about the partnership between

25
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,280
voice assistant and then some more nice

26
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,400
cool tricks with Cortana even Cortana on

27
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,380
Android because this is not confined to

28
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,880
just Windows machines I will have to

29
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,409
talk a little bit about the whole

30
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:27,060
responsible disclosure and the

31
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,360
engagement with Microsoft around

32
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,030
publishing vulnerabilities and hopefully

33
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,130
we have some useful conclusions for

34
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,290
everyone who thinking of building new

35
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,079
systems so without further ado let's

36
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,610
talk about voice assistance those are

37
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,619
Cortana and Alexa and Siri and Google

38
00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:49,409
assistant and we call them voice

39
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:54,060
assistant but the reality is that these

40
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,649
are intent resolution systems their

41
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:02,340
whole purpose is to take human intent

42
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,149
expressed in natural language or some

43
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:09,929
type of human interaction and translate

44
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,540
it into computer actions like browsing

45
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,350
the web

46
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,290
or launching program or getting some

47
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,770
data for you now the thing with this

48
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:23,040
assistant is they emphasize the

49
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,100
hands-free operation okay so you can do

50
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,700
that without going and interacting

51
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,130
directly with your computer and that

52
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,100
implies that they have to operate over

53
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:42,570
what we call the locked screen so just

54
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,730
to give you some context about the work

55
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,830
we've done here we started two years ago

56
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:50,190
and we wanted to evaluate the effect of

57
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:53,150
that hands-free that above locked screen

58
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:57,920
operation of Cortana were able to

59
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,350
disclose 17 vulnerabilities and report

60
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:04,590
them to Microsoft but we only got two

61
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:09,150
CVEs yes itself why is that okay now

62
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,920
this is troubling actually this is

63
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,560
troubling because it turns out that

64
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,810
software vendors only register cv if

65
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:21,420
they have if they are forced to deliver

66
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,440
a customer patch if they can fix the

67
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,320
vulnerability in their own servers in

68
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,430
the cloud they never register cv they

69
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:36,630
never report the vulnerability and it

70
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:40,650
just fades away which means that as a

71
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,290
customer as an organization you can't

72
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:47,700
even ask the question was I affected by

73
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,660
this vulnerability I think this has to

74
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,590
be changed in the future and we got some

75
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:59,850
nice bug bounty Thank You Microsoft so

76
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,190
here is Cortana we all know that we have

77
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:07,290
a Cortana client on our machine it's a

78
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,920
fat client I'll talk about it but most

79
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,080
of the heavy lifting is done in the

80
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,900
Cortana service in the cloud actually

81
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,890
the client takes the digital audio sends

82
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:22,169
it to the Cortana service were sent to a

83
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:25,620
speech-to-text engine text goes back to

84
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,740
the client just

85
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,440
for display purposes and the client says

86
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,050
okay I get the text now resolve that for

87
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,810
me and it goes back to the cloud goes to

88
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,509
a text to intent engine and it's being

89
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:40,210
transformed into a command with

90
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:43,120
parameters now based on the specific

91
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,240
command this Cortana service looks for

92
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,280
the proper plugin the plot the proper

93
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,979
skill to execute that specific command

94
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:56,169
execution is usually through some

95
00:04:56,169 --> 00:04:59,680
third-party web services search engine

96
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,550
other applications and the response is

97
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,520
then packed into a JSON structure which

98
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,280
is called the card data which is then

99
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,009
translated by the Cortana Service to

100
00:05:12,009 --> 00:05:15,580
HTML and JavaScript that goes up until

101
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,900
the client for merely rendering a quick

102
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:26,710
example I'll be asking who is George

103
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:29,860
Washington for example voice goes the

104
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,919
speech text text is going back just for

105
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:37,240
display purposes and then resolve that

106
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,639
for me text goes to the text to intent

107
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:43,080
engine and the command is search

108
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:48,340
parameter is George Washington now there

109
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,650
is a plugin there's a skill within

110
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,229
Cortana service that goes to the Bing

111
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:56,500
search engine okay it takes the query

112
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,830
George Washington goes to the web finds

113
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:00,610
the answer

114
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:04,000
packs it as a JavaScript and HTML page

115
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,610
and then it goes for rendering if we

116
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,919
take a deeper look into how this looks

117
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:14,050
wouldn't ii as you can see most of the

118
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:17,050
processing is done on the cloud there's

119
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:21,159
no decision made by the Cortana client

120
00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:24,780
on your computer there are two phases of

121
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,190
processing in the cloud one is audio

122
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,710
processing the other is semantic

123
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,740
processing that's the more important

124
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,800
there's a lot of machine learning

125
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,020
involved in in this process of Cortana

126
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:38,860
it's

127
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,419
being used for improving the speech

128
00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:42,759
recognition which I don't really care

129
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:46,060
about more importantly it is being used

130
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:49,599
to extend the intent resolution

131
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,479
capabilities and we'll see how that

132
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,900
affects security okay this is how the

133
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,840
JavaScript looks like this is a specific

134
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,319
use for launching a browser that goes to

135
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,009
a specific song this is how it looks we

136
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,229
talked about the plugins the skills most

137
00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:10,840
of them are written by Microsoft but

138
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,139
this framework or third parties to add

139
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:15,430
their own skills

140
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:18,699
it's basically an azure boat that you

141
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:22,509
write you deploy it in the cloud you

142
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:24,969
connect it to a Cortana channel and it

143
00:07:24,969 --> 00:07:26,889
works there is of course a validation

144
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:31,629
process with Microsoft it's very easy to

145
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:34,779
bypass or you can actually put anything

146
00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:38,740
you want into a skill interaction of the

147
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:42,279
skill with the actual machine is limited

148
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:46,210
to card data okay it's very limited not

149
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:47,800
to say that we couldn't hack our way

150
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,210
through it so our journey into this

151
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:54,460
starts with the announcement in 2016

152
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,039
that Cortana will now work on your

153
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,240
lockscreen and because it sounds kind of

154
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,940
dangerous right

155
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,940
Microsoft says well for sensitive tasks

156
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,800
or those that launch applications

157
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,469
Cortana will prompt you to unlock your

158
00:08:11,469 --> 00:08:14,020
device so they thought about security

159
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:19,210
and because it's now dead secure we can

160
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:24,599
have it run by default on lock screen

161
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:30,849
okay ah mmm that's interesting

162
00:08:30,849 --> 00:08:33,429
we have a Fed client on your machine

163
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:36,940
that can basically do anything through a

164
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,659
very powerful JavaScript API it has no

165
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:41,409
brains

166
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:44,620
it makes no decision but itself and it's

167
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,620
available on lock screen once you say

168
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:52,260
hey Cortana what could possibly go

169
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:57,120
wrong with that so very soon after we

170
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,620
started the research we found the first

171
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,970
of all nur ability we called the divorce

172
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:03,510
of Esau and and these are all attacks

173
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:07,260
that are classified as evil made they

174
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,320
require some temporary physical access

175
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,110
of an attacker to a locked windows

176
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:16,110
machine first month allows the attacker

177
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:20,690
to launch over locked screen and

178
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:24,690
Explorer browser into an unsafe server

179
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,090
which means that you can quickly

180
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,560
translate this into a man-in-the-middle

181
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,170
attack and then download the exploits

182
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,660
and compromise the browser in the entire

183
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,930
machine it's a bit complicated

184
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:39,450
okay so we have denied the second one

185
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,600
which is Open Sesame

186
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,030
that allows you to actually open the

187
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:49,320
equivalent of a command line on locked

188
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,320
screen with just a few words and

189
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,340
keystrokes

190
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:58,890
I'll show similar examples soon scale of

191
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,840
death I talked about third party skills

192
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,380
we showed how someone can deploy a skill

193
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:07,860
to the Cortana service the third party

194
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,380
skill and use that skill over locked

195
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:14,820
screen to take over a machine and there

196
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,430
were a couple of others found McAfee as

197
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:21,180
well we talked about being able to

198
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,520
execute arbitrary code over lock screen

199
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,950
so here's another example of a

200
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,780
vulnerability that we found out over

201
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:33,570
time and interesting in enough the same

202
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:36,090
day that they announced Cortana over

203
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:38,490
locked screen they announced a cool

204
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:41,790
skill called the reminder skill so you

205
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,800
can actually go to your machine and say

206
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,090
hey Cortana set up a reminder of course

207
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:51,180
do it over lock screen and insert a new

208
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:55,650
reminder into your library for some

209
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,710
reason for some reason when you create a

210
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:02,100
reminder you can add a photo to it not

211
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,740
only text

212
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:08,400
so here here's how it goes I invoke

213
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:13,460
Cortana and I ask to set up a reminder

214
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:16,650
so far so good you see the ad the photo

215
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:25,380
button out there now when I try this

216
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,360
functionality I can pick up from a

217
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,420
library which is a different name to say

218
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:36,390
it's my D so yeah this family is not

219
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:41,010
that happy anymore so I can go over

220
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,530
there photos which is cool and nice at

221
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:46,860
the same time I'm inserting a drive with

222
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,370
USB stick into computer I don't but it's

223
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:52,110
convenient because I can now take all

224
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:56,010
the photos and download into the drive

225
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:58,380
and you're probably asking yourself why

226
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:02,280
just photos you know it just clearly no

227
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,190
reason why I should go for just photos I

228
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:08,450
just look for any file on the computer

229
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:10,800
yeah they have their passwords there

230
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,870
Shane ah but it's not only data access

231
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:23,190
it turns out that this winder this is an

232
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:26,250
actual command line okay so I can

233
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:30,450
execute stuff from the USB stick I just

234
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,430
plugged into the machine I can go and

235
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:35,430
download load file in it and execute it

236
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:39,920
and you know by now it's game over okay

237
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,770
it's a length demo okay it could happen

238
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:46,050
in 20 seconds

239
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:51,540
okay so again complete takeover over

240
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:54,810
lock machine by using a proton scale and

241
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:57,360
the fact that I can open this Explorer

242
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,650
window over lock screen Microsoft were

243
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:04,800
very fast to fix that in the cloud

244
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,830
they had a patch in no less than two

245
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:12,970
months and what they did they remove

246
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:16,810
and photo button over locked screen so

247
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:20,589
if you do this when computer is not

248
00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:24,310
locked you get that button if you're

249
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:26,019
doing it on a locked screen you don't

250
00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:28,870
get that button functionality of having

251
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:31,660
a command line executed from comment

252
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,240
from Cortana is still there okay

253
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,759
remember so that was cool but here is

254
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:54,790
something cooler that can interact with

255
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:57,279
each other so we can stop imagining

256
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:04,839
because this already happened and we

257
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:06,490
found a very cool vulnerability that we

258
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:11,170
call Alex and personally I really like

259
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:13,240
this slide but we will have to move to

260
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,660
the next one

261
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,810
it's Lee

262
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:26,570
it just did

263
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:29,729
[Music]

264
00:14:34,319 --> 00:14:39,970
show me one way okay cool

265
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:44,920
so lesson one and what is this

266
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,279
partnership all about well it's a

267
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:53,050
collaboration between and Microsoft that

268
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:57,160
allows a Cortana users to open Alexa on

269
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,910
Windows 10 Alexa to open Cortana on

270
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:03,910
their echo devices they simply say hey

271
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:06,879
Cortana open Alexa and then the Alexa

272
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:09,759
skill is running on a Windows 10 and

273
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:13,149
Alexa users can say Alexa open Cortana

274
00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:17,589
so the idea behind this partnership is

275
00:15:17,589 --> 00:15:21,310
that now users can get the best of both

276
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:24,819
worlds it means that Cortana users can

277
00:15:24,819 --> 00:15:26,740
now have access to more than 50 thousand

278
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:30,930
skills of Alexa and Alexa users can now

279
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,879
use some of Cortana skills that interact

280
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:36,610
with the out Lucas other office products

281
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:40,389
but in terms of security they get the

282
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:43,209
worst of both worlds because if we know

283
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:46,600
already that Cortana is not perfect then

284
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,519
also Alexa is vulnerable to for example

285
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:53,709
little shells for my chat mods I've

286
00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:56,230
shown last year that they are able to

287
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:59,589
develop a malicious skill with unlimited

288
00:15:59,589 --> 00:16:02,350
recording time session which can play

289
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:05,559
like an eavesdropper in your home so if

290
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:10,209
we have to assistant very unique very

291
00:16:10,209 --> 00:16:12,550
powerful that are working together what

292
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,939
could possibly go wrong

293
00:16:14,939 --> 00:16:22,149
and apparently a lot the first problem

294
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:26,050
that we found is when you are not signed

295
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:29,680
in into Alexa then it will require you

296
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,040
to login into your Amazon account which

297
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,430
is very illogical but the way that they

298
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:39,730
implemented this login mechanism is by

299
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:42,939
opening a browser and Internet Explorer

300
00:16:42,939 --> 00:16:47,339
browser on your lock screen which

301
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:51,380
the meaning of such a thing is that the

302
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,360
attacker can now navigate to his own

303
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,370
website maybe download is exploit and

304
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:01,460
also it can login into the Facebook

305
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,260
account or other social accounts using

306
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:07,099
the cash for themselves so let's see the

307
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:13,790
demo here we are asking katana to open

308
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:20,869
Alexa and we get this window which asked

309
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:24,560
us to sign in to Amazon but if we do not

310
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,640
log in whether clicking on this link we

311
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,790
see that this is simply a browser on

312
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,800
your lock screen a customized Internet

313
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,800
Explorer and well in the Amazon website

314
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,940
we can search for items and our goal now

315
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:44,990
is to escape from the Amazon website you

316
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:48,290
see that we do not have a URL bar and

317
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:52,700
above so we need adult weeks here we get

318
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,970
into the facebook login and we can see

319
00:17:55,970 --> 00:18:00,860
that if the browser has saved the cached

320
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:03,110
credentials of the user then we will be

321
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:13,400
able to hack it just a second here we

322
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,370
see that in this button if we click then

323
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:18,620
it's already saved the credentials from

324
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:22,100
the previous session and here we are on

325
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:29,720
the Facebook of the victim device so now

326
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,220
I want to ask you something

327
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:34,250
until now we saw how you can steal data

328
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:38,090
how you can open a browser but what a

329
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:41,980
kid what heckles love the most

330
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:45,570
what money

331
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:50,160
okay so how can we abuse this

332
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,230
partnership in order to steal money from

333
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:57,520
the lock device well known without

334
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:02,020
Bitcoin so here we see Alex on the lock

335
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:06,010
screen and there is a very unique skill

336
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:11,670
of Alexa which is called donation skill

337
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:16,360
and it is really really simple you

338
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,690
simply say hey Cortana open Alexa donate

339
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:23,620
money to a name of a charity and you can

340
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,080
donate up to five thousand dollars in

341
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,310
one donation and what is really amazing

342
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:34,600
is that by default this ability to buy

343
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,770
stuff and donate something is turned on

344
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:41,800
but the setting of having a voice code

345
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:50,370
to accept this donation is turned off so

346
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:55,630
yes and although everyone can open his

347
00:19:55,630 --> 00:20:00,790
own fake charity it requires some some

348
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:03,910
effort but it is possible so we cannot

349
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:06,280
just donate to a specific charity can

350
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,650
donate to your own so I want you to

351
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,660
imagine that you are very responsible

352
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:15,130
and you left your device locked in your

353
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,980
locked room before you left or eating

354
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:21,160
something but still someone an attacker

355
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,250
can simply cross the hallway shall take

356
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,680
odana open Alexa donate money to my

357
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:33,730
charity and it will work here is a quick

358
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:38,440
timeline this integration was released

359
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,980
on a 15 August a couple of weeks later

360
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,930
we already reported this to Microsoft

361
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:47,350
and they were really quick with the six

362
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,720
actually I have to say that in all

363
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,820
vulnerabilities that they were very fast

364
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:55,120
and they simply removed Alexa from the

365
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,360
lock screen and let's think for

366
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:02,140
second why this happened then I thought

367
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,990
of two main reasons the first one is

368
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:09,310
that Alexa is mainly designed to

369
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:14,260
increase Amazon online sales so this is

370
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:17,350
why the ability to buy stuff and also

371
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:20,590
donate stuff is turned on by default and

372
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:24,790
the second reason is that Alexa which is

373
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:28,060
usually running on smart speakers is not

374
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:31,690
aware of the term locked screen they

375
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,240
simply do not have they do not have

376
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,020
locked mode and it doesn't have a screen

377
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:40,030
so when adding this together we get this

378
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:45,580
vulnerability and now we are done with

379
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,570
Alexa and we are moving on to another

380
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:52,090
interesting integration between Cortana

381
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:58,330
and Spotify and maybe you think that in

382
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:01,090
the previous SEC integration with Alexa

383
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:03,670
the ability to open a lecture on your

384
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:06,220
lock screen was simply a mistake they

385
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,150
didn't mean to do it

386
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:10,630
but here we can see in the integration

387
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:13,990
between Cortana and Spotify that on the

388
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:16,600
official website of Spotify that will be

389
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,910
proud of the fact that it works above

390
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:22,480
the lock screen as well as below so this

391
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,250
is a design flow okay and you can

392
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,800
already think what will happen if you

393
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,470
are not already signed in into Spotify

394
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:38,350
right we'll get this screen shot asking

395
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:41,020
you to link to Spotify okay then link to

396
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:44,260
Spotify and we'll get exam again the

397
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:48,190
same window that is called connecting to

398
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:51,310
a service and from here we can again

399
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:53,500
click on other links for example the

400
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,050
login to Facebook with Facebook and from

401
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:59,980
there to other websites and to download

402
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:06,610
your own malicious exploits so and we

403
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:09,040
found many vulnerabilities in Cortana

404
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,260
some of them disclose private

405
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,120
information

406
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,720
like Skype contacts your calendar events

407
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,020
and many more things and we won't have

408
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,809
time to see all of them but we wanted to

409
00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:24,169
share another vulnerability which is a

410
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:29,820
very funny also so mm here we are on the

411
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:34,140
lockscreen and we ask Cortana what is

412
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,419
the phone number of Microsoft customer

413
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:39,570
service okay maybe we want some help for

414
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:42,570
Microsoft and then we will get this

415
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:45,059
phone number okay of Microsoft which is

416
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:47,909
actually converted into a link and when

417
00:23:47,909 --> 00:23:50,940
placing on this link we get the people

418
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,870
application running on your lock screen

419
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:56,549
here again there is a button named at

420
00:23:56,549 --> 00:24:02,340
the photo and you already know where it

421
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:07,049
goes from here it was doing the World

422
00:24:07,049 --> 00:24:08,399
Cup this is because of the football

423
00:24:08,399 --> 00:24:15,179
pixels of all the you and we can see all

424
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:17,429
the contacts all the people and here

425
00:24:17,429 --> 00:24:20,789
again we search for a Open File dialog

426
00:24:20,789 --> 00:24:23,909
and we found it and for me again we can

427
00:24:23,909 --> 00:24:28,590
run executables and that can be

428
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:32,460
everything we can we seem to take over

429
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:36,750
on your log device and what we can learn

430
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:39,899
from here is that you need to solve the

431
00:24:39,899 --> 00:24:43,260
root cause of your of the vulnerability

432
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:47,880
it's not enough to cut the the path to

433
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,669
this dialog it's not simply to remove

434
00:24:50,669 --> 00:24:53,760
this link or an other button you need to

435
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,220
solve the root cause which is the

436
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,860
opening of a file dialog on your lock

437
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:05,820
screen so we talked a lot about Cortana

438
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:10,289
on Windows 10 but we didn't stop there

439
00:25:10,289 --> 00:25:13,830
we also wanted to check what will happen

440
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:16,409
on other log devices for example and

441
00:25:16,409 --> 00:25:22,320
though it forms Mac devices also and

442
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,460
even Windows Phone

443
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:28,120
and we found in all of the categories we

444
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,280
found vulnerabilities and we want to

445
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:34,770
share something on Contin on Android and

446
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:39,520
if we think about it then having a voice

447
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,890
assistant on your mobile device

448
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:42,580
lockscreen

449
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:45,730
is even more logical than on your locked

450
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:50,410
PC because we are instantly using our

451
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:53,550
phone and it is not very convenient to

452
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:57,550
say to insert a pin code every time so

453
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:59,560
if you can simply talk to Cortana on

454
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,170
your lock device it is very convenient

455
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:06,670
this is how it looked like okay we have

456
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:07,240
Cortana

457
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:12,130
this is taken from a commercial

458
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:15,670
advertisement of Cortana here we have a

459
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:19,030
button that we can simply swipe and get

460
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:24,600
a menu of what of the calendar of the

461
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:31,210
weather and something else so they have

462
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:35,770
an ability that we found here and you

463
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:38,710
again Microsoft thought about the

464
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:43,780
security issue of this of this device

465
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:47,080
when you want to ask Cortana something

466
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,690
it will ask you to open the device first

467
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:54,550
but if you return to Cortana and ask you

468
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:57,370
to do it again then it will accept it

469
00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:02,770
let's see how it looks like now we lock

470
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:07,570
the phone and you can see that there is

471
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:10,420
a pin code and well opening Cortana

472
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:14,470
while pressing on this button and we are

473
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:16,780
simply type we can also type to Cortana

474
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:19,150
you don't need also you do not need just

475
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:22,120
to say something and we typed something

476
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,340
and here is written please unlock your

477
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,590
device to continue but if we open

478
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:29,699
Cortana again

479
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:38,770
if we open Cortana again then we will

480
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:44,170
see that it it stinks what to do with

481
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:46,210
what we've written and then if we click

482
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:49,570
on the search button we again have a

483
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:52,570
browser on your log device on your

484
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:55,180
Android device and from ill we're also

485
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:58,150
already signing into a user account and

486
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:02,260
from here we can access your emails your

487
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:07,120
contact list your calendar and simply

488
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,640
all your information on your sensitive

489
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,030
phone

490
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:21,160
we access the email we can see all the

491
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,500
old conversation everything from your

492
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,860
look to a device and as I said before we

493
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:29,559
found also stuff on Windows Phone and a

494
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:32,080
Mac and other stuff but we won't have

495
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,350
time for this and I mean I will continue

496
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:54,490
from here I want to hack in maybe need

497
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:56,350
to say twice or three times and then it

498
00:28:56,350 --> 00:29:02,410
works let's talk a little bit about the

499
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:04,630
whole process of finding the

500
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:06,610
vulnerabilities and and then working

501
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:08,200
with Microsoft to fix them

502
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,020
and that kind of will lead us to the

503
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:15,340
conclusion at the end we're responsible

504
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:17,440
researchers so we do responsible

505
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,669
disclosure and there were a couple of

506
00:29:21,669 --> 00:29:27,429
cases or it was very clear there is no

507
00:29:27,429 --> 00:29:32,340
other way to fix the problem other than

508
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:35,799
send the customer patch and register a

509
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:41,470
CV and and I have to say Microsoft was

510
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:46,900
very efficient in doing that you know I

511
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,610
remember reporting vulnerabilities to

512
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:52,270
companies Microsoft others 10 years ago

513
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:56,260
15 years ago that would think sometime

514
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,929
between 6 months to 18 months for a

515
00:29:58,929 --> 00:30:01,660
company to fix vulnerabilities no they

516
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,700
were very fast in fixing even those that

517
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:07,780
required patches but then for most of

518
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:12,309
them they said hey we have this very

519
00:30:12,309 --> 00:30:19,240
easy fix in our cloud like okay there's

520
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,860
a choose a photo button in some skill

521
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:26,950
let's change that skill to not have a

522
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:30,940
photo button there is still a

523
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,570
functionality for open

524
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:35,809
that command-line over locked screen in

525
00:30:35,809 --> 00:30:39,710
decline but presumably it cannot be

526
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:44,240
accessed anymore oh we have this

527
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,389
connected to a service thing that

528
00:30:47,389 --> 00:30:51,320
sometimes pop up when you try to execute

529
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,259
a skill but did not register first you

530
00:30:54,259 --> 00:30:59,389
know and it kind of gives you trouble so

531
00:30:59,389 --> 00:31:05,230
we go one skill after another and kill

532
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:10,279
that functionality it still exists in

533
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:14,480
the client okay but but hopefully we cut

534
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,950
all connections to it probably the worst

535
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:23,059
we had it's the first one voice of eso

536
00:31:23,059 --> 00:31:26,450
there were certain phrases that you

537
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:29,269
would say to Cortana that would invoke

538
00:31:29,269 --> 00:31:34,809
and explore over locked screen going to

539
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:38,330
unsafe servers would say something like

540
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:41,539
at the beginning hey Cortana go to

541
00:31:41,539 --> 00:31:45,139
bbc.com and for some reason while maybe

542
00:31:45,139 --> 00:31:47,539
see that tom was still not a safe server

543
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:51,009
at that time it would just do that so

544
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:55,399
Microsoft went and fixed their cloud

545
00:31:55,399 --> 00:32:02,929
engine to wire these phrases into safe

546
00:32:02,929 --> 00:32:07,460
searches but do you remember machine

547
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:12,370
learning cortana actually taught itself

548
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:16,429
around this fix because we constantly

549
00:32:16,429 --> 00:32:21,529
found out more and more phrases that

550
00:32:21,529 --> 00:32:23,809
would actually do the same and it's not

551
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:26,830
that they existed before it's that

552
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:31,519
people were teaching cortana that go to

553
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:35,179
BBC is just the same as go to bbc.com

554
00:32:35,179 --> 00:32:39,279
but it's not to a safe search or

555
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:42,620
something like can you tell me something

556
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:45,720
about BBC yeah i can tell you about me

557
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,280
see I can take you to their side and

558
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,460
it's not safe okay

559
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:52,080
so we kept finding this thing and

560
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,290
reporting these things and they would

561
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:58,640
keep making all those small fixes

562
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,580
instead of changing the state of mind

563
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:07,170
and and really fixing it in the client

564
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:09,600
which required of course if he is

565
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,020
sending a page of the client and so on

566
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:16,530
at some point your vial became so good

567
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:17,720
at that

568
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:21,390
that Microsoft said you know what that's

569
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:24,300
enough that's enough we don't want to

570
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,080
admit defeat

571
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,570
okay so Cortana would still work on

572
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:30,960
locked screen but the reality is that

573
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,370
whatever you would ask Cortana to do it

574
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:37,950
will say I'd be happy to do that for you

575
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:41,400
please unlock your device first so it

576
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,340
would actually write on your lock screen

577
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:47,160
you can ask Cortana this and that but

578
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,770
you go and ask Cortana dances I'll be

579
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:51,810
happy to do that for you but you need to

580
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:56,720
unlock your PC first and that was like a

581
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,940
really nasty change especially for a

582
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:03,540
research but also for users because it

583
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:06,300
was not announced it was not published

584
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:09,030
it just happened overnight because it

585
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:14,010
was fixed in the cloud and at that point

586
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:18,090
say okay so security problems are gone

587
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:21,120
right and if you unlock your device

588
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:26,880
first and here I can really say the hand

589
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:30,780
is quicker than the I really need nimble

590
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:34,620
fingers for that we're invoking Cortana

591
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:38,550
over lock screen we're asking for a

592
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:41,520
reminders skill and again we're being

593
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,170
persistent because we're doing that

594
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:46,139
twice while we're clicking on the

595
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:50,409
password field and

596
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:53,380
see who turns back it's the same

597
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:56,139
reminder skill with the same and a photo

598
00:34:56,139 --> 00:35:02,050
button okay so here's my conclusion from

599
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:07,900
that you say you know what's the moral

600
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,150
here and and many of you would say well

601
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,770
the moral here is that you have

602
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:13,780
convenience and you have security and

603
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:18,490
you have to balance them that's not the

604
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:21,820
case that's not the case Microsoft did

605
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:27,520
not disregard security Microsoft did not

606
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,920
choose convenience over security they

607
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:35,770
they had security in mind okay they they

608
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:38,650
invested in it okay they did code

609
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:43,330
reviews they why there SDLC so what

610
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:46,960
happened and I think this is the whole

611
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,440
purpose of this research teach us a

612
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,480
little bit little something about how to

613
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,450
create security system you need to ask

614
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:57,190
the right questions at design-time

615
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:59,920
okay because people were taking the code

616
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,130
piece by piece and say well is this code

617
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:06,810
secure reality is the code is secure

618
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:10,450
problem is with the interfaces problem

619
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:13,390
is with taking one system like Cortana

620
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:15,550
that has some security assumptions

621
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,040
taking a different system

622
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,810
Alexa would have very different security

623
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,760
assumptions okay we tied them together

624
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,920
and we maintain the same security

625
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,300
assumptions now you ask the right

626
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:32,800
questions per the new concept that you

627
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,020
are going to invent the right question

628
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:40,780
here would be for example can I create a

629
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:45,070
voice malware now that's a very stupid

630
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:47,950
question can I create can I create a

631
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:49,780
voice ransomware can I come to a

632
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:52,690
computer and say hey Cortana please

633
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:56,290
encrypt all my files it's a stupid

634
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:58,990
question right but when you start asking

635
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:01,540
that question which is what led to this

636
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:03,820
home research when you start asking

637
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:06,850
question you understand that in the

638
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:11,020
context of having voice assistant this

639
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,780
is the right question to ask and we

640
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,490
start asking this question you start

641
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:18,040
uncovering the issues and the problems

642
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:21,460
and and you can start finding where you

643
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:24,250
got it wrong now the next is of course

644
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:27,370
you have to solve the root cause okay if

645
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:30,340
you have the Cortana agent that can make

646
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:34,840
no decisions and allows you to link to

647
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:40,210
insecure URLs at some point someone is

648
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:43,000
going to tell that engine go to an

649
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,530
unsecured server if you have a client

650
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:52,570
that has the functionality of displaying

651
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:58,060
a browser arbitrary browser with

652
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:01,630
arbitrary partner pages on your lock

653
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:05,770
screen at some point someone is going to

654
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:10,750
tell that client do just that okay you

655
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:12,490
need to realize what the root cause is

656
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:14,260
and then you need to solve it in the

657
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:19,770
right place did that find files window

658
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:22,540
that you've seen in a number of the

659
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:25,110
vulnerabilities it will strike again

660
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:28,000
there is no doubt about it it will

661
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,740
strike again because again there is a

662
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,080
client there that can make no decisions

663
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:36,570
that is able to display that

664
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:40,360
functionality now what should have been

665
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,030
done that client should have made the

666
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:45,330
simple decision I'm saying I'm not

667
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:49,180
displaying that Explorer window on

668
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:53,500
locked screen very simple decision that

669
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,150
would eliminate all these

670
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,740
vulnerabilities and the one that will

671
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,210
find that there is no doubt about it

672
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:02,200
okay but needs to be patched and solved

673
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:07,780
in the right place so that's our small

674
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:10,870
contribution to building secure systems

675
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:16,380
and to 45 minutes of fun thank you

676
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:44,820
question well few cases we try to ask

677
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,550
them why don't you do that like this one

678
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,990
[Music]

679
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:50,910
it's a big machine it's a big machine

680
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:53,520
they have a very efficient front-end

681
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,940
that communicates with you they don't

682
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:02,750
have the full picture always they try to

683
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:05,880
escalate a few of the issues back as

684
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:10,800
they can so that's that's a bit tough I

685
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:15,089
have to say telling them how to fix it

686
00:40:15,089 --> 00:40:22,880
was was was not working anyone it yeah

687
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:27,799
[Music]

688
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:37,380
[Applause]

689
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:42,550
yes and no no because if you look

690
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:45,280
carefully at what Cortana says about

691
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:50,380
identification it says you can only

692
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:53,619
apply that for the hey Cortana thing ok

693
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:55,450
which is not always necessary for

694
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:59,130
invoking Cortana and they say we will

695
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:02,680
try to do it as best as we can

696
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,860
reality is that in this case they prefer

697
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:08,920
convenience to security it's very easy

698
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,230
we've done a different project with the

699
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:14,170
Google assistant where you need to do OK

700
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:16,770
Google in order to open your phone and

701
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:20,680
we and and you do need to be identified

702
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:24,430
with your own voice there that was a fun

703
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:26,860
project we did it again in the Technion

704
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:32,110
with graduate students and it was not

705
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:34,540
very difficult to have enough

706
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:37,060
combinations of people saying OK Google

707
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:39,280
that that would open that for you even

708
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,790
if it's not your own voice it's not an

709
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:46,210
extremely strong measure especially with

710
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:52,740
with you know short phrases anyone else

711
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:54,860
thank you

712
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:57,860
[Applause]
