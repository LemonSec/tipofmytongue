95
00:04:00,669 --> 00:04:02,859
actually the core team this is the team

96
00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:05,169
that has been working since last year to

97
00:04:05,169 --> 00:04:07,420

98
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:12,380

100
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,220
them later on today on this very stage

101
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,070
we want to remind you for my very first

102
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,110
piece I'd still Aviv we focused on the

103
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,330
fact that with great power comes great

104
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,500
responsibility

105
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,270
and this year that is more true than

106
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,580
ever before what do we mean by that we

107
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,550
focus here at V sides on principles of

108
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:34,010
ethical hacking of responsible

109
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,080
disclosure we believe that the knowledge

110
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,760
and ideas that we are going to share and

111
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,310
learn today are very powerful and could

112
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,410
actually lead into the wrong path if

113
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,750
they are done with the wrong or the

114
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,970
malicious motivations so what we really

115
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:49,760
want to focus this year and today is on

116
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,740
learning the skills we need so that we

117
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,690
can help organizations and help people

118
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:56,210
not for any malicious intent and once

119
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:58,070
you start on that dark path it's very

120
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,470
hard to get back into the right side so

121
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,870
please stay with us and invar can tell

122

and they all want to hire you we also

168
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,630
have an awesome after-party with

169
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:55,020
sponsors and have faced and half the box

170
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,690
for silver sponsors for our after party

171
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,010
and our chill-out zone we have

172
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:00,690
checkpoint and clear sky you can meet

173
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,940
them as well actually this is an

174
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,470
important opportunity to tell you where

175
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,420
to find our chill-out zone and are

176
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,670
hiring around so the chill-out zone is

177
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:11,910
generally over there the hiring ground

178
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:15,000
is generally over there and it should be

179
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,010
signs outside helping you find your way

180
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,900
higher ground is where you get hired

181
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,570
chill-out zone is where you relax you

182
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,820
can confuse the boat but I think it will

183
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,680
have more fun if you stay in your

184
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,750
designated areas what else

185
