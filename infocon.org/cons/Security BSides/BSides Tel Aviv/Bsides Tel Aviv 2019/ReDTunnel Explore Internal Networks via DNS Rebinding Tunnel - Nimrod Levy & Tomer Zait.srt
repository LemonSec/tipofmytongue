1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,939
so Tomer Nimrod will be talking about

2
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:07,259
red tunnel exploring internal networks

3
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:10,099
by a DNS rebinding tunnel and this is a

4
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:13,259
really interesting talk that we really

5
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:15,480
wanted to be in this conference so this

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:27,779
is for you guys thank you okay my name

7
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,359
is Tom ersite I'm a security researcher

8
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,860
at f5 networks I'm also a CTF competitor

9
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,149
and creator and I'm an open source

10
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:46,890
developer and that's it Nimrod so my

11
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:47,969
name is Nemo Devi

12
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:49,950
I am the CTO and co-founder at

13
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:55,230
scorpianas I'm a play playing with CTF 2

14
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,539
and giving back the community with

15
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:08,340
developing open source tools so today we

16
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,500
will talk about the red tunnel first of

17
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,600
all we will explain you how the DNS

18
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,140
rebinding is works and note that this

19
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,500
presentation was in black at last year

20
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,340
and will be in United States also

21
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,070
so before we will explain what is the

22
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,229
DNS rebinding we will talk about a

23
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:30,180
little bit about the the browser

24
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:35,970
destructions so we will talk a little

25
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,220
bit about the same origin policy

26
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,829
what is the same origin policy same

27
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:45,500
origin policy is a security level that

28
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:50,640
validate validate your hostname scheme

29
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,070
and port and if something on this day on

30
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,100
the this part is not correct is veiled

31
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,610
you will block due to same origin policy

32
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:07,409
and then if you have for example if you

33
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:10,649
have a your domain appears in crusader

34
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:11,480
you

35
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,780
not will be blocked so this example to a

36
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,319
domain that you don't appear in the

37
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:20,080
cross header and you will be blocked and

38
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,920
if you have the same domain you will

39
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,659
approved and you can get you will get

40
00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:29,569
the response on the same origin by the

41
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:31,489
same origin you will get a response on

42
00:02:31,489 --> 00:02:37,129
the site so we need to talk a little bit

43
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:40,819
about the DNS if you can see that you

44
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:44,180
have a DNS response packet that contain

45
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,920
the the direction to the host DNS

46
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,280
translate names to host in order to

47
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,379
direct you the specificall that you need

48
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:57,680
and you can see that in the here in the

49
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,049
DNS response you directed to the local

50
00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:07,030
host and you have a 150 to a TTL time so

51
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:11,690
how the DNS caching is walks when you

52
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:15,799
send a request the TTL say to your DNS

53
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:18,799
cache server and to how long time you

54
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:21,950
need to store the information that you

55
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:26,620
cached so you can see that we start

56
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,470
initial go to the DNS record and achieve

57
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,299
the information and after that you can

58
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:36,669
see that in our DNS cache server we have

59
00:03:36,669 --> 00:03:44,359
140 seconds to be in life back then you

60
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:48,049
can see that we change the IP value to

61
00:03:48,049 --> 00:03:53,959
another IP and make a DNS cache request

62
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:58,280
again and you can see that we have more

63
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,389
time for the DNS a time to the TT a time

64
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:08,530
to live is still remain 24 hour seconds

65
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:12,970
time to live it's the time that your

66
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:16,160
information will be stored in the DNS

67
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,579
cache we will have a time for questions

68
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:23,480
so we will explain it and later well

69
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,860
the the the TTL will be gone you will

70
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:35,810
you can see that it's okay you can see

71
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:39,140
that the DNS cast is empty and we when

72
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:43,070
we recall the same domain we will update

73
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:47,330
the DNS information about our record and

74
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:50,060
the IP address will be changed to one

75
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,030
three three seven

76
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:55,430
so let's illustrate the process and we

77
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:59,210
will explain how it smoke so first of

78
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:02,330
all we send a request to evil.com domain

79
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:06,380
and get our server IP when we get the

80
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09,860
server IP we will send a get request

81
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:14,120
that achieve our a malicious JavaScript

82
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,490
code and you can see that this code is

83
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:20,750
just call itself every one second until

84
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,420
the title has been changed when the

85
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:27,170
title has been changed the DNS rebinding

86
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:32,720
process will will work because when the

87
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,690
DNS will change the IP again and they

88
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:39,290
and the DNS cache will gone if the

89
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:44,630
others will be changed to 192 168 1 1

90
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,030
and you will get access to this internal

91
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:53,300
host ok so now we'll talk about what

92
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,900
happened before retinal so before

93
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,860
retinal we had a DNS Tools process all

94
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,630
DNS tools works almost the same you

95
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,700
needed to gain information about your

96
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,890
victim because if you don't know your

97
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:12,140
victim you won't know that those

98
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,830
automatic scripts will work then you

99
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,990
need it to scan the internal network you

100
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:21,020
need to find hosts and ports and without

101
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,080
it you have nothing you have just the

102
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,180
local host now you need to choose a

103
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:33,470
specific payload a JavaScript file that

104
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,870
will attack the web application but it's

105
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:36,770
specific

106
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:39,139
javascript file data.txt specific web

107
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:41,389
application you can change it you have

108
00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:45,770
only one way to to win just with this

109
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:48,020
javascript file and just these feet

110
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:53,479
worked correctly so what is the

111
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:57,669
disadvantage it disadvantages

112
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:05,889
disadvantages thank you thank you yeah

113
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:09,830
so we need the information about the

114
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:14,409
victim assets it's hard to get we need

115
00:07:14,409 --> 00:07:17,419
to configure the application DNS

116
00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:22,000
rebinding tool but it's hard or it's

117
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,120
it's not available yes there is no

118
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,349
configuration you can configure it now

119
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:33,740
we have the scanners so the scanners are

120
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,979
mostly slows because they use only time

121
00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:41,479
out attacks and they inaccurate because

122
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:43,759
they use oddly time out the text because

123
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,259
time out is inaccurate and there is no

124
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:51,080
victim management you need to management

125
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,750
the victims we need to know where the

126
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:57,259
victims are and their assets we need to

127
00:07:57,259 --> 00:08:00,650
use those the victims web applications

128
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:03,909
and you just can't

129
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:06,979
so the payloads are limited as I said

130
00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:09,199
the payloads use only one web

131
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,099
application and web application is not

132
00:08:13,099 --> 00:08:20,779
what we want quantity we okay okay I

133
00:08:20,779 --> 00:08:26,449
thought something going to blow okay so

134
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:32,659
after a panel I will say what retinol do

135
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:35,539
the process of retinol so retinol will

136
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:37,700
get the internal IP adjust for you Oh

137
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:43,578
romantic okay and it will scan for the

138
00:08:43,578 --> 00:08:47,630
internal hosts it will scan for open

139
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:50,720
HTTP ports so if you have internal hosts

140
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,079
it's not enough you want to know that

141
00:08:53,079 --> 00:08:58,100
the hosts behind it has HTTP ports with

142
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,160
HTTP applications so it will scan for it

143
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,490
automatically it will by a bypass

144
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,920
browser limitations because we had so

145
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,699
many problems with browsers and chrome

146
00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:15,500
is the best with problems and it will

147
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,630
bypass those limitations for you because

148
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:20,600
we done the work for you it will

149
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,680
automate the DNS rebinding process and

150
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,670
that's what you want

151
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:29,810
it's a DNS rebinding tool now it will

152
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,730
tunnel through the victims to Denny

153
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:34,430
internal network but not automatically

154
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:37,730
you will be able to just surf the web

155
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:41,270
like you serve any other web application

156
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:45,230
you're just google.com or any other web

157
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:48,050
application and you will be able to

158
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:50,000
manage all the victims in one single

159
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,630
page you will see the GUI it's great

160
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:59,360
thanks Dima so a retinal architecture

161
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,800
and this is how retinal looks like we

162
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,449
have the core application the core

163
00:10:05,449 --> 00:10:07,850
application is actually the management

164
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:10,850
and the victim side and the client side

165
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:13,579
that protect the victim so we have the

166
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:15,500
client browser behind the client browser

167
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,670
we have a network with many servers and

168
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:23,870
desktops and we know that the client

169
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,390
browser the client actually click the

170
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:29,120
link and this link contains the retinal

171
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,079
exploit it's not a real exploit it just

172
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:36,940
uses the browser capabilities but

173
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:42,319
exploit them and he served the web with

174
00:10:42,319 --> 00:10:45,529
the our Stoli terre game and he likes to

175
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:47,660
play solitaire he have fun playing

176
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,270
solitaire but now retinal is chatting to

177
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:53,180
get internal IP address scanning the

178
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,360
host can in the ports and rebinding all

179
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,010
the ports and the hosts do

180
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:04,800
different domains and actually how it

181
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,090
works when it started scanning when we

182
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,820
found the ports we create an iframe and

183
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,520
this iframe tells the DNS server Oh

184
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:20,100
someone opened this this URL and we have

185
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,790
specific URLs that will tell the DNS to

186
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:26,550
change the IP address and our JavaScript

187
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:29,640
code will do the same as you saw in the

188
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,690
DNS rebinding

189
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:36,120
process and but the difference is now

190
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,030
the victim

191
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,940
he's the server by itself

192
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,970
the attacker can send commands to the

193
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,400
victim it's not a real commands just

194
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,390
surfing URLs from the management and he

195
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:55,560
can get all the information and actually

196
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,880
surf the web applications from its own

197
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,180
computer in home it's like you had an

198
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,970
internal network but you just put it in

199
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,020
DMZ

200
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:11,760
without asking anybody you'll see it

201
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,780
it's nice so of course it's an open

202
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,520
source software because we are

203
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,560
open-source developers so we can

204
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:26,070
download the source and now I will play

205
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,680
a pray for the Democrats and I will try

206
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:37,310
to make this demo works I will just open

207
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:48,600
ok so now we will see the web

208
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,870
application this is the attacker the

209
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,760
attacker has an admin controller

210
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,840
commander Kushan

211
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:59,760
ok you can see it so I will just set it

212
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,569
to duplicate

213
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:10,490
do it one sec I know okay don't worry

214
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:16,190
now we can say it okay you could see it

215
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:21,200
okay great so this is the admin panel

216
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,410
you can manage all the victims here

217
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:27,870
here's the targets and here's their

218
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,880
configuration it's a really simple

219
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,250
configuration you can just set the

220
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:37,320
timeout set the pool size said the if it

221
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,839
you want it to be a loopback only or you

222
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,209
want it to shuffle the IP addresses do

223
00:13:42,209 --> 00:13:44,790
as you want you can add ports to the

224
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:48,290
scanner just have fun with it

225
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:53,700
now when we saw the panel let's see the

226
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,330
tool so here is the web application I

227
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:12,140
will just okay what what happened

228
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:24,949
okay I need a killers of it

229
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:33,939
kids I can see the processor

230
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:39,330
okay let's see if work somehow I will

231
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:42,300
just start thing okay it works

232
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:47,940
so I open Soul Eater and now the client

233
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,580
think he playing Soul Eater now why I

234
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,500
choose Soul Eater I will tell you while

235
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,380
it's scanning I chose solitaire because

236
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,380
I can't lose with solitaire if I chose

237
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,530
Backman I could lose here and everyone

238
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:05,270
made fun of me by losing the game so

239
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:08,550
that way I can't lose it's too slow to

240
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:15,810
lose and you can see their logs but I am

241
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:21,090
scanning the ports and will see it here

242
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:30,000
on the retinal so we see someone

243
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,370
connected to the retina I see have other

244
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:35,040
peoples trying to connect to a panel

245
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,350
it's not a good idea guys like if you

246
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:44,070
want me to see your assets just ask so

247
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:46,530
now we scan for the ports we have all

248
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,660
ports here and we have logging and it's

249
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,530
dark so you can see it and now we

250
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:56,850
automated the the process of the scanner

251
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:05,990
so now it's rebinding all the so now we

252
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:13,620
automated the binding process and we

253
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:18,150
should see it in a few seconds DNS

254
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:24,650
rebinding could take time it's not me

255
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:30,970
let's see if there is something no just

256
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:37,030
one webpage sound let's look it could

257
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:40,510
take time so between the time that we're

258
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:44,200
waiting that it will work it will get us

259
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,800
all the hosts and now we get it so it's

260
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:53,500
okay so now when we got the hosts we can

261
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,290
just solve explore those hosts you can

262
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:59,380
just serve the webpages so I will click

263
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,870
on one host and you can see every host

264
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:05,079
contains the IP address with dishes not

265
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:08,859
dots and we have the port I hope you can

266
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:17,589
see it okay you can see it and the diid

267
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:22,119
of the victim so now when we want to

268
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:27,250
just explore the applications some more

269
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,040
we can just click on authentications

270
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,020
with basic identification ID already

271
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,330
clicked it so i will need to do it from

272
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:36,910
another browser I should think about it

273
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:45,000
before so let's go to a tunnel

274
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:50,490
we have the login

275
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:57,100
and we have the hosts now we'll choose

276
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:02,420
this host with Tomcat and we can click

277
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,880
the management app you can see the basic

278
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,200
authentication popped up we can just

279
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:13,880
know the dark mood

280
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,600
what time why do I dark Vador where I

281
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:24,410
find dark one now let's see nightlight

282
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:31,550
now okay where's the video ok the video

283
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:34,810
won't work also it's the same thing so

284
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:43,990
we can just use the web application and

285
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:49,760
get your spot back please help me what

286
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,150
happened

287
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:09,730
let's see if you can see the the demo

288
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:16,210
video maybe so the video works like the

289
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:22,710
video works okay you can see the video

290
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:30,370
fu demo gods no now we've done this

291
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:35,470
sound so the victim surf the web

292
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:38,620
application you can see it scanned for

293
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:41,500
the hosts and now it will scan for the

294
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,390
ports and you can see the ports right

295
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:46,090
there and now after it scan for the

296
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:49,060
ports you will see that it started the

297
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,950
rebinding process I will just get it

298
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:53,020
forward and you see the rebinding

299
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:56,970
process finished and we have an internal

300
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:01,450
DNS the domain service domain names for

301
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,480
every ton of their application and now

302
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,240
we just go to the application and we can

303
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,860
surf the application we can download

304
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:11,710
binary files if you have binary files in

305
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,110
this web application and you can see the

306
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:18,130
IP address as I mentioned earlier now

307
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:21,120
we'll go to another web application

308
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,950
actually a vulnerable web application

309
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:26,410
because if it's not vulnerable what show

310
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:32,530
it and now I we serve to Apache we have

311
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:36,460
popped up basic authentication we can

312
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,070
just insert the credentials and get into

313
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:41,320
the web application with the basic

314
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:45,340
authentication but it's not enough we'll

315
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:48,460
show you how you can exploit web

316
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,920
application using other methods other

317
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:55,150
than put a post or get we will use put

318
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:57,970
so you can send every method tedious of

319
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:00,550
web applications even though all the

320
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:04,510
other tools are limited we'll just do

321
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:08,040
Who am I because Who am I to undo it so

322
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:13,840
you'll see it work now Who am I and it's

323
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,670
magic without hands so we send Who am I

324
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:22,480
and now we'll go again to the web

325
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,150
application to the retinal will choose

326
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:28,570
another victim so or another host it's

327
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:31,030
the same victim but other hosts in the

328
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:33,310
internal networks we can explore this

329
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:37,240
web application and the nicest thing in

330
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,270
red tunnel is that you can use your own

331
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:42,730
tools your own automatic tools like SQL

332
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:46,210
map or other tools with retinal all you

333
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:49,540
need to do is just saving the session so

334
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:52,060
you have retinal session and without

335
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,880
this session you will you will not be

336
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,640
able to serve those web pages because

337
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,120
there were security people so it will be

338
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,200
security so now we copy the the request

339
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,780
file we'll save it because we want the

340
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:10,420
session and it's the easiest thing to do

341
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:15,960
in SQL mob we'll choose a PowerShell

342
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,910
because it's the default and I did it

343
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:25,450
had time to click on CMD and now we use

344
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:33,270
SQL map to search for the users so we

345
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:36,250
injection with doing the SQL injection

346
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:39,040
attack through SQL map through the

347
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,280
victim to its internal network to a

348
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,610
specific host in the internal network so

349
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:47,980
it sounds hard but everything is easy

350
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:51,490
with the redundant so now it's just

351
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:53,860
asking questions and we say no no no no

352
00:22:53,860 --> 00:23:03,149
no hell no I'm running forward

353
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:10,130
almost yes and now we have the users and

354
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:16,280
password hash see no directory and

355
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:26,930
that's it and I want to thank - Dima

356
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:31,410
Belski for the awesome UI and to max

357
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:35,760
rank for the perfect logo and now for

358
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,110
your questions we have 10 minutes maybe

359
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:43,020
a little bit less but you can ask

360
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:54,120
questions we know that it happened in

361
00:23:54,120 --> 00:24:03,870
the wild with I think the servers of the

362
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:07,380
World of Warcraft company Blizzard so

363
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:11,100
the blizzard servers there was some DNS

364
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:14,480
rebinding attacks in the world

365
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,859
yes

366
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:29,630
yes you have you the best ones is just

367
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:35,600
to create HTTPS certificates and not

368
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,760
allow HTTP you can also check for the

369
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,680
hostname and if you check for the

370
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,830
hostname we can just manipulate it in

371
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:49,460
the browser so it will work and there's

372
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:53,440
a few ways to protect yourself by

373
00:24:53,440 --> 00:25:06,770
disallowing the DNS server to but still

374
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:08,900
I think the best solution is just to use

375
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:13,820
HTTPS I have to say something when you

376
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:16,100
think about the red tunnel concept you

377
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,290
should know and understand that is the

378
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:21,320
same concept like a CDN because if you

379
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,750
for example open a Facebook in Israel

380
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:26,210
and fly to United States and just to

381
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:28,910
refresh the page the IP will be

382
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:32,390
different and change because CDN give

383
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:36,350
you the the nearest the closest IP

384
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:39,590
address that he have in order to make it

385
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:42,890
fast so the operation of DNS rebinding

386
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:48,530
it's very close to the CDN operation so

387
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:52,130
the only way to close the this

388
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:57,230
vulnerability is only to hardening your

389
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:59,780
application and not your network because

390
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:04,010
it's not a cool way to to close internal

391
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:14,090
IPs from domains another question yes

392
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:20,930
oh it's a nice question okay we have

393
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:24,500
okay so he asked how the communication

394
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,440
works between the client to the server

395
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,560
because the clients need to be a server

396
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,830
and the server returns their webpage

397
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:36,560
like anything is it like it's a regular

398
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:41,710
web application so we used WebSocket and

399
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:45,470
by using WebSocket you actually connect

400
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,120
to the server but you have a push

401
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,080
notification send push to the

402
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,260
application now the thing about nodejs

403
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:57,860
and it's really good for this example is

404
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:00,830
that you can just take the response

405
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:04,070
object store it in another dictionary

406
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:08,360
and use it later like it's an it's an

407
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,360
object that's still in the memory so we

408
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,660
can we could store it in a global object

409
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:18,920
and then use it when we call the webpage

410
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,070
so when we call the webpage we wait for

411
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:25,330
the response but the response will be

412
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:29,900
achieved by getting the information we

413
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:32,830
needed from the WebSocket connection and

414
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:35,990
the WebSocket connection will just send

415
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:39,190
a response will all the headers and the

416
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:42,230
information we need we created some

417
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:45,230
techniques to make the browser

418
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:49,990
understand that a redirection occurred

419
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:55,070
using javascript but without it it's

420
00:27:55,070 --> 00:28:01,070
just how it works it was good enough for

421
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:03,830
a desert I know it's hard to understand

422
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:12,770
it but okay another question so thank

423
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:14,889
you
