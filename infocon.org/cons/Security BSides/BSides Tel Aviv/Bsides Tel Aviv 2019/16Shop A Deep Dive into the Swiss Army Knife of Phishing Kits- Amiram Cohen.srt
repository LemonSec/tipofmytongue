1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,589
at home so hello everybody my name is

2
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:07,109
Amira and I'm going to present you the

3
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:10,050
sixteen shop is a unique fishing kit

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,790
that I actually did a reverse

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,340
engineering it's quite interesting

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,529
because we don't hear things like that

7
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:19,380
on fishing and in this case I did the

8
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,970
reverse engineering I'll explain it

9
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,869
about it later so first of all nice to

10
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:26,189
meet you I'm very passionate about

11
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:29,699
computer since very early age I learned

12
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:32,189
what develop I've learned web

13
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:34,530
development and since then I'm trying to

14
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,980
tackle several websites and I succeed I

15
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,190
was in the cyber security center at 800

16
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:46,649
unit I lately finished my walk in Akamai

17
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:49,739
as security data analyst and today I'm

18
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:52,199
in exile Ventress we see which is

19
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:55,350
enterpreneurship program I'm trying to

20
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,640
start my own venture

21
00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:01,890
so today the clicker doesn't walk

22
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,640
alright yeah today we are going to talk

23
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,100
about phishing and I have some questions

24
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,770
for you how many of you did sea fishing

25
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,420
lately raise your hand

26
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,420
fishing page simply great how many of

27
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,930
you click view source when they did see

28
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,360
the fishing plans right and how many of

29
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,200
you actually see the PHP code behind the

30
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,979
fishing page so great it just few what

31
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:33,119
in general great so today I want to talk

32
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,650
about fishing sometimes I'll explain

33
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,119
basic words but don't let it fool you

34
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:42,060
I'll go into deeper things but the

35
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,340
latter is the aiming to towards all the

36
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,470
audience also the part I didn't handle

37
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,500
the fishing so be patient about basic

38
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,799
things that I'll explain so what we are

39
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,390
going to do we'll start with

40
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,549
understanding what is fishing kids how

41
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:00,990
we get it how can we explore it we will

42
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,390
go to the features of the 16 shop

43
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,210
fishing kit which is very fascinating

44
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,750
and eventually we are going to do a demo

45
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,630
kind of go through and then

46
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:14,330
how we explore fishing kids when we get

47
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:16,790
one and we together will reveal a hidden

48
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:20,570
feature so most of us think about

49
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,880
fishing kids as something as a simple

50
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,160
HTML page with maybe a little bit

51
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,500
JavaScript but nothing behind them but

52
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,370
today were more aware of complex fishing

53
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:34,160
kids they look like that they have a

54
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,460
good is defined structure then you were

55
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:41,150
organized and probably they have some

56
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,720
organization behind them I'm not sure

57
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,140
about it but can be so what is the

58
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,840
fishing kit let's explain it basically

59
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,970
it's a convenient way for the attacker

60
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:56,960
to deploy a phishing pages on a server

61
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,450
it means that is it's a zip file that

62
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,850
contains all the server all the server

63
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:04,790
information or the server-side code

64
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,490
behind the phishing page and once it's

65
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:10,430
extracted on the dedicated Ocampo server

66
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:13,190
the fishing is started starting to one

67
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:17,780
so if we have a attacker and he gets

68
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,750
some sort of communication or attached

69
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:24,050
to some server he puts a zip file this

70
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:27,860
zip file is been extracted to the on the

71
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,530
server and afterwards we're getting a

72
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:33,290
live fishing page now most of the

73
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:35,830
researcher so as I think and very

74
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,090
investigate the fishing gate from this

75
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,070
side from the front end that's what we

76
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:43,610
usually see but sometimes when you are

77
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,620
standard the code is being changing them

78
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,360
the frozen is been changing all the time

79
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,460
and somehow sometimes you won't be able

80
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,790
to see this this page as it is so I'm

81
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:55,100
suggesting to explore this fishing kit

82
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,800
from the fishing from this side from the

83
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:04,610
zip file on so try to understand why the

84
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,740
explain this basic technique to

85
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,910
understand how can we get a fishing kit

86
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:13,400
basically fishing fishing hiding in

87
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,430
nested directory within the website it's

88
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,950
me that if we have a long URL and

89
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:22,370
mastered path the fishing kids here

90
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,120
sometimes

91
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,610
the attacker that put the fishing period

92
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:30,630
on the on the server is forget to delete

93
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:34,350
the zip file and yeah it's pretty much

94
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,690
embarrassing and the server enables

95
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:39,150
directory listing because if it's a hack

96
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,220
server from the first place the server

97
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,520
wasn't that good in configuration right

98
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,050
so if you know bells enables the

99
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,730
director I think we're actually able to

100
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:50,460
see the the fishing kit a lot at the zip

101
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,830
file alongside the fishing itself and we

102
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,770
actually can download it simple very

103
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,500
simple well just we can apply it so

104
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,740
thick can shop this deficiency do are

105
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,470
going to talk about is very interesting

106
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,729
basically it's a new one it has been

107
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:08,430
published one months ago within Akamai

108
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:13,200
blog and it target Apple users it apply

109
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,020
it's a post also mobile and desktops

110
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,350
together and it's probably written by

111
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:23,790
this guy we'll get into it and we'll see

112
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,950
and by the way this is the appearance of

113
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:33,979
this fishing so when I rich and when I

114
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:37,289
started to get this fishing kit I have

115
00:05:37,289 --> 00:05:41,640
more than 500 files in one zip and there

116
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,650
was a big challenge to understand which

117
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,810
in which way in which direction the

118
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,450
election should like go so basically

119
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,400
I've looked forward entry point most of

120
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,930
the time entry point will be the index

121
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:55,410
dot HTML or main dot PHP things like

122
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:58,169
that afterwards we will try to

123
00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:00,419
understand the flow figure out how

124
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:03,570
things go it means that we usually we're

125
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:06,660
going to do it using the form tag the

126
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,120
form HTML tag it means that if we have

127
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,150
for example if we have an HTML tag with

128
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:17,700
an action and the methyl and maybe some

129
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,100
hidden input we try to work off all that

130
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,360
on the server side in this case this is

131
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,729
the PHP code with the get and the view

132
00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:31,139
equals yahoo login and this form sends

133
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:33,390
the information to this server in this

134
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,180
way which we are actually trying to do

135
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,289
the reverse engineer in

136
00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:39,960
generic process so in this case the 16

137
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,879
shop flow is like that the user or the

138
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:47,759
victim gets an email link

139
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,180
afterwards he need to fill his login

140
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,830
information his apple credentials and

141
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,199
after he's filling his appearances

142
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,629
information if he if he's using Yahoo

143
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:04,259
Japan for example he will need to you

144
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:07,020
will get a Yahoo Japan phishing page

145
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,619
yeah and those two things on the same

146
00:07:10,619 --> 00:07:15,240
fishing kit afterwards he will require

147
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,270
to fill out more more detail about

148
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,119
himself like an address I did and even

149
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:24,709
his mother's names pretty impressive so

150
00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:28,009
after what is getting a verified by Visa

151
00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:30,839
it's kind of two-step authentication for

152
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:34,649
visit and that mainly apply in the Asia

153
00:07:34,649 --> 00:07:38,550
we're not familiar here in Israel and

154
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,849
also in eventually he requests for

155
00:07:41,849 --> 00:07:44,879
uploading a photo here of him holding a

156
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,419
credit card holding his credit card I'm

157
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:50,159
not sure who is going who is going to do

158
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:52,439
it but that's what a child the dog and

159
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:58,439
probably succeed in some way so this

160
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:00,300
fishing kit is highly configurable this

161
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,459
he has three different dance as you can

162
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:04,649
see over here that the attacker can

163
00:08:04,649 --> 00:08:07,050
config for this for this fishing

164
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:10,860
campaign he okay

165
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,800
he also can configure many things as the

166
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,629
evasion techniques and all the flow that

167
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:19,159
we can see before that is actually

168
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:21,449
configurable the attacker can choose

169
00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:23,399
which place we will be able to we will

170
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:26,219
be able to see and which page we won't

171
00:08:26,219 --> 00:08:29,369
be able to see within the process so as

172
00:08:29,369 --> 00:08:32,130
I'm not zooming that you see all the

173
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,049
chart and the words but they can I

174
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:36,389
assume that you can see the colors so

175
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:39,328
the blue and the blue squares are the

176
00:08:39,328 --> 00:08:40,708
decision points the points that the

177
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:43,679
attacker can actually get the

178
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,930
information this is the flow of the old

179
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:51,860
efficient gate so the blue points there

180
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:56,120
there are eight blue points and eleven

181
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,550
eight blue points that the attacker can

182
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:02,190
decide what to do and what not there are

183
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:06,000
11 phishing pages and five points that

184
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,250
mainly is being sent to the attacker in

185
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:13,380
this way he's he's he's getting the

186
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,880
information about his victims

187
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,980
let's go on so now we have a video okay

188
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:22,340
wait a moment

189
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:37,440
yeah yeah so actually this is the this

190
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,300
is the configuration file of the of this

191
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,420
fishing kit you see there are three dams

192
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,440
three different dams the user actually

193
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,020
fill up fill out these details in this

194
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:53,160
case it's Yahoo Japan male and this

195
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,650
password and afterwards we can see that

196
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:59,490
he will be redirected from a format from

197
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:03,750
an applet into UTA off into your logon

198
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:07,890
page let's see that's it and this is

199
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,360
still in the phishing page right with

200
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:16,820
his is mail over here yeah

201
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,600
yeah so in this vision key there are

202
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,550
several evasion techniques so let's

203
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,890
first of all try to understand what is

204
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,260
efficient technique it is ethically it's

205
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,780
basically access control mechanism for

206
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,700
the fishing kit he decides who will be

207
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,800
able to see it and we won't be able to

208
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,250
see the fishing page the fishing he

209
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,230
trying to do to defend themself from

210
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:46,140
unwanted visitors who are unwanted

211
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,590
visitors the send search engines like

212
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:52,440
Google there are automatic scanners like

213
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,310
children and also like the security

214
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:59,250
researchers like us so it's pretty much

215
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,140
proven ematic to try to detect those

216
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:05,280
fishy kids it's not a new thing it's not

217
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,380
a new concept try to avoiding from

218
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,350
security researchers and good and Google

219
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,630
search but in these specific fishing

220
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,240
kids we've getting several new evasion

221
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,370
techniques and we have a lot of variety

222
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:20,040
of them that's why that's why we are

223
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:26,370
going to talk about it great so there

224
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:27,840
are several common is avenging

225
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,790
techniques maybe some of some of us

226
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,130
familiar of them I'll go through through

227
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:35,070
them anyway anyhow based on the user

228
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:38,850
agent that the phishing kid can

229
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,770
understand if the user is coming from

230
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:44,190
with a mobile or desktop it's coming or

231
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:47,730
within Windows or Mac or kind within

232
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:49,320
Chrome or Safari that's why he can

233
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,310
target his victims in a narrow stroke

234
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:55,110
very very very very carefully to

235
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,780
understand who is going to see this and

236
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:04,020
who not he can also block our using

237
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:07,040
specific IPS we can see within his list

238
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,800
brands like northen and Kaspersky

239
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:14,790
Kaspersky and more others so he did a

240
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:17,970
really good job about it and also we can

241
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:21,060
block specific IP IP in the can block

242
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:26,270
specific IP ranges not the specific IP

243
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,400
another common evasion technique it's

244
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,220
the htaccess file for one of us that

245
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,120
didn't live with apache it's the access

246
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,790
control configuration file for for the

247
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:42,130
Apache server and we think this fishing

248
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:45,340
kit I'm going to see a block request

249
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:50,080
from different sites like he can block

250
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,530
people that come in from Google search

251
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:56,820
in that way and they actually doing it

252
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:02,890
she also block a block user a block user

253
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:05,680
agent that contains specific word which

254
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,210
means that if you trying to access this

255
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,160
fishing kit using crawl you won't be

256
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:14,440
able to do it great the server has new

257
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,060
evasion techniques within this fishing

258
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:19,060
kit and the first one of the of the

259
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,010
evasion technique is quite interesting

260
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:24,100
he does this fishing kid can block

261
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,770
replay attack between the sessions

262
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:29,590
between each stage is sending is sending

263
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:34,270
a post parameter with the I will md5 of

264
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:38,140
the IP of the I victim it's mean that if

265
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,510
someone is binding this and trying to

266
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,700
sniff the traffic won't be able to

267
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:46,720
replay it to the to the same server

268
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,240
it won't see where we won't be able to

269
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:54,010
see the same things and also he's trying

270
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:56,560
to block because it doesn't have

271
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,660
specific app army he the attacker can

272
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:02,550
easily config which get Palin it will be

273
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:08,140
and he can also mark finished victims

274
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:11,770
with the session variable to understand

275
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:13,660
that they shouldn't do this

276
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:18,480
the fishing again it's quite word right

277
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,370
another new version techniques that this

278
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:25,480
fishing kit is very surprising way using

279
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,340
third parties API to understand more

280
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:30,970
about the victim is actually accessing

281
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:35,740
some is querying ISP API and check which

282
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:39,040
which is P the user came from it can be

283
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,060
basic Etienne

284
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,640
and things like that you can block it he

285
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:47,770
also using a proxy Chuck and - and he's

286
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:51,250
attaching to is going to feel about the

287
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:54,390
API to do that

288
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:58,240
and you can also allow only one visit

289
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,850
per IP it's not which is not that

290
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:03,190
complicated but I've never seen it

291
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:04,410
before

292
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:07,120
it's mean that he's logging already

293
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,880
visited ip's right and also that I can

294
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,870
identify the HTTP x-forwarded-for header

295
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:18,670
which means that when you're using the

296
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,890
proxy and we're trying to when you're

297
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:24,400
using proxy you this letter has been

298
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,280
added and you won't be able to solve

299
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:31,600
this this fishing kit great so as we

300
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,470
said he always using a ISP check and

301
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:37,570
proxy check if you need to take a photo

302
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:40,600
of the slide it's a great very easy to

303
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,620
use api's but also he uses a girl

304
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,980
location to customize to customize his

305
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:52,230
audience and he's presenting a different

306
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,760
default language for each one of the of

307
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,930
the origin countries he also checking

308
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:01,810
the six first digits of the credit card

309
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:06,460
and by data understand what is the

310
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,260
vendor of the credit card and if you are

311
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:11,080
enter a visa you will get a visa logo on

312
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,090
the screen after that if you will enter

313
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:16,180
a MasterCard you will get a MasterCard

314
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:19,750
logo on screen after that so it pretty

315
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:29,050
much impressive let's go on a this this

316
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,580
fishing kit is also available for

317
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:34,540
purchase it costs around $50 if you want

318
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:38,860
to buy and don't do it but within each

319
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,020
access he's doing a license a license

320
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,270
check to another server it's kind of

321
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:46,960
since the mechanism that the server also

322
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,570
allows the remote configuration it's

323
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,910
quite interesting until and

324
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,610
no a long time this server is still

325
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:57,700
alive so it's quite impressive if you

326
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:03,850
won't be if you won't buy this fishing

327
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,260
key than the old license will be expired

328
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:10,569
you will see this is log of 16 shop he

329
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:14,410
expired with a link for bite if she

330
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:18,880
wants up this particular also have

331
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,640
several admin panels one of them is a

332
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,190
remote configuration file basically uses

333
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,319
to configure the flow and the evasion

334
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,020
techniques and it also have local

335
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,750
configure a local admin panel which

336
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,020
seems like to be more the fishing

337
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:39,250
statics and try to delete the logs on

338
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,640
the local machine it looks like that

339
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,310
the what's in controllable here that the

340
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,650
author has left several of the leftovers

341
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,830
and we can see we can understand that he

342
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:53,110
is in donation public is using in the

343
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:56,170
Indonesian one we think this function we

344
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:58,300
can see kill him remember this function

345
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,450
carry mail it's actually sent sending

346
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:05,650
Indonesian and also women jeonggi I

347
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:08,770
I mean jeonggi a scam page which is

348
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:12,400
enter scam page this is the log function

349
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,440
for this is the log things that they log

350
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,500
so we started Lee you remember there by

351
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,320
me link so yes actually link to his

352
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,720
Facebook accounts yeah it's impressive

353
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,150
and if if you go to this Facebook

354
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,920
account we actually go get a picture of

355
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,560
him and also picture of him with his

356
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,800
mother I'm not sure if his mother will

357
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:42,190
be very proud of his son probably if you

358
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,690
are talking about social media this

359
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:46,000
person also have a Twitter account and a

360
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,670
YouTube channel YouTube channel it is on

361
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:51,910
sting say that so we published in 1900

362
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:54,670
to this to his YouTube channel now you

363
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:57,070
won't be able to do it because Akamai

364
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:01,240
has published it and and only is doing

365
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,030
is published videos for explaining

366
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,400
yourself trying to Adele advert

367
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:10,559
yourself and was actually alive several

368
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:17,220
weeks ago as I said he's highly customer

369
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,980
customized for his victims he supports

370
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,050
ten different languages quite of

371
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:25,020
impressive it changes by the victim's

372
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,570
country as we said so it looks like that

373
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:30,510
actually 10 different languages and all

374
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:34,350
the bar configured by the victim's

375
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:40,920
country also the attacker has configured

376
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:45,650
several logs withing this within this

377
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:49,710
fishing kit it mainly to understand if

378
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:52,260
he if the fishing in wok is working well

379
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:55,559
or not he has nine logs we don't go

380
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:57,570
through all the logs now but you can see

381
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:59,670
that he is trying to be as much tight

382
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:07,380
about his victims great so we finished

383
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,030
the first part now we are going to the

384
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:11,730
hidden feature and together we will feel

385
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:13,980
some very cool idea within this fishing

386
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:17,910
kit it's it's in process that if done

387
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:20,520
try to understand things in this fishing

388
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:25,350
kit so hope you enjoy as I said we try

389
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:28,860
to to understand the entry point yeah so

390
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,260
this is the index dot PHP page and we

391
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,870
think the index the within the index dot

392
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:37,290
PHP page we can see include of main dot

393
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:41,130
PHP I can see it in several places

394
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:43,140
during the code it's something that

395
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,330
developers are usually doing it nothing

396
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:47,850
nothing new but here I try to dip down

397
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:50,550
the it down into the main dot PHP so

398
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:53,910
here is the main dot PHP page and if you

399
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,790
will go enter it we will see several

400
00:20:55,790 --> 00:21:00,090
several weird lines the first one is the

401
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:02,790
dollar image that equals to something

402
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,800
like Sebastopol

403
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,290
it's a really weird way to write it also

404
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:10,700
there's a dollar value that equals g.z

405
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:14,809
try to understand what it

406
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:20,670
this inflate afterwards you read a

407
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:24,450
content of a file which called MX MX

408
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,490
Basilica Siletz I'll help you it's in

409
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:29,670
the Indonesian it's called tiny and iMac

410
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:33,210
stands for American Express so he with

411
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:35,850
some picture in that white with very

412
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:39,210
weird and now I have this function this

413
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:42,990
is the last web function called valid

414
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:45,540
with dollar SE let's try to understand

415
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:48,300
what he is doing we are actually

416
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,760
creating we are actually creating a temp

417
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:55,590
a temp file we add a PHP tag into the

418
00:21:55,590 --> 00:22:00,540
name to this file right the source code

419
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:03,420
over here yeah you see what ouch the

420
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:07,650
source code with the PHP tag close it

421
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:10,910
include a temp file and then delete it

422
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:13,110
what this function does is actually

423
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:15,330
returns the defined variable within the

424
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:18,930
scope it's pretty much not clear why why

425
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:21,900
is doing that in that way is doing kind

426
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,050
of evil evaluation function converting

427
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:28,470
string into code and it's very weird way

428
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:31,620
to do it afterwards

429
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,330
all those things that we see here come

430
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:36,990
travel together to this line and this

431
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:39,420
line is not that that understandable but

432
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,490
if you try to understand it it is the

433
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:45,510
more readable text so it said that we're

434
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:48,810
taking the AMEX Castle this the PNG PNG

435
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:52,440
file look on the earth on the byte

436
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:58,080
number 5,000 126 and on do as gzm flight

437
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,360
than the the evaluate function that we

438
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,140
see earlier and then extract it's not

439
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,270
that understand not that understandable

440
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:08,790
how to figure out how its works and it

441
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,770
took me a while to understand why a

442
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:13,350
fishing cadet most of the time written a

443
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:18,180
very readable text put these things here

444
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:23,220
so I took the picture try to I don't

445
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,290
know print it understand what stands

446
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:28,200
inside as you see it's binary code there

447
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:28,710
was no

448
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:32,220
no special fits special things so I'll

449
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,350
try to do the Jesus inflate and actually

450
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,120
God readable text

451
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,510
what's which was very very nice we can

452
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:41,340
see here there is some comment that

453
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,960
called the validate resolved and

454
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,240
afterwards some function declarations

455
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,850
what what coming after the function

456
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:49,950
declarations it's a whole bunch of

457
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:53,190
basics before that it's unreadable so

458
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,890
and probably something very very special

459
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:57,420
he's happening here

460
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:02,160
let's try to understand it kind of tense

461
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:07,370
stenography right so let's copy it into

462
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:13,320
the running machine if you try to run

463
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:17,460
the code and bring the variables within

464
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:20,250
the code in this way and I'm not a guest

465
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,900
assuming that you see all the other

466
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,810
lines and we'll honeyton of sandbox we

467
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:26,880
will get these suitable taxes basically

468
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,930
we will get a lot of an understable and

469
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:32,160
understandable text but we'll get also

470
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:36,420
this forget content URL encode and some

471
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:40,830
message and at this point understand

472
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,630
that he's trying to do something with

473
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:45,930
maybe a file or neither URL right

474
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:50,070
there's a URL encode a code in a pitch

475
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:53,150
in the PNG that has some code that

476
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:58,020
access well let's try to print what

477
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,570
inside this file yet content I will get

478
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:04,020
this thing which white I was shocked

479
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:08,040
when I saw it it's a telegram telega

480
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:11,130
bought he's doing something with a

481
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:13,440
telegram but I tried to pick this

482
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,210
telegram part and I understand that is

483
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:18,200
actually alive it's a live telecom bot

484
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:23,640
cool and I try to understand what what

485
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,980
he sends after the text yeah the text

486
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,600
equal this is the message that is being

487
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,020
sent to the to the attacker or to

488
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:31,950
someone

489
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:33,630
yeah and

490
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:36,360
so I looked for the message and the

491
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,220
message that is being sent and

492
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:41,490
understand it's a dollar a let's try to

493
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:43,410
understand what's the dollar a dollar a

494
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:46,049
we see we seen in the Indus code that

495
00:25:46,049 --> 00:25:49,140
equals to a message variable and message

496
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,330
the variable is defined as global which

497
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:53,730
means in each place that we have message

498
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:57,270
defined it will be equals a and this

499
00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:01,230
will be sent to the attacker or to

500
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:07,260
someone see - probably so remember the

501
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,909
function from earlier the killing male

502
00:26:08,909 --> 00:26:11,610
the one of these parameters is message

503
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:14,400
dollar message and kimmel is the

504
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,870
function that sending the mail to the

505
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:18,929
attacker the original attacker so each

506
00:26:18,929 --> 00:26:23,220
time so each time we have and this is

507
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:26,070
the the message is the example of how it

508
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:28,799
looks like that the user the password

509
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,480
and other information that may be

510
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,490
crucial for the attacker like the city

511
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:36,870
region and time zone and every time that

512
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:39,030
the this dollar message is being defined

513
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,880
in the code there's also a validate

514
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,250
function it's been run you see it over

515
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:48,419
here yeah so this is the validate it's

516
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:51,770
the same validate function that runs

517
00:26:51,770 --> 00:27:00,330
from the picture cool so now understand

518
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:03,179
what what happens let's try to figure

519
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:04,919
out altogether it means that if we have

520
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:07,890
a phishing that sends a mail to an

521
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:10,799
attacker we have another direction

522
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,549
another channel that is being applied

523
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:16,110
with that is actually written in the

524
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:19,919
code and it's being sent to another

525
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:22,020
attacker within a telegram channel

526
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,080
telegram board it's quite oppressive

527
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,179
think about this person he actually buy

528
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:30,419
it probably for $50 yes and there was

529
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:32,940
another person maybe the author of the

530
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,669
fishing kit that actually still his

531
00:27:35,669 --> 00:27:37,700
still information

532
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:43,200
yes legal right so when I said I was

533
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,840
quite shocked and

534
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:48,740
very fascinating and that's it

535
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,910
so what you are what we have gone today

536
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:54,620
I've explained some of things about

537
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:58,670
fishing kids how can we get him how can

538
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:02,690
we look on them I've explained all the

539
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:04,790
feature of the 16 shop we said it's

540
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:07,370
highly configurable fishing it has

541
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:10,340
several stages and variety of evasion

542
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:13,940
techniques this this fishing kit is also

543
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:17,060
uses a third party's API and it is a

544
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:20,000
saleable one you can buy it for $50 as I

545
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,360
said the lab the author has left several

546
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,320
leftovers and also is war he has a

547
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,260
YouTube channel with nine videos for

548
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:34,670
tutorial to admin panels local remote

549
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:38,510
and also has he supports them available

550
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:42,560
just we have magnets the try to figure

551
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,900
out if especially if it's works or not

552
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:48,400
and the space he has really nice

553
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:54,980
pleasurable telegram bot so that's it

554
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:57,980
it's again the same present identically

555
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:04,670
for nothing but it's work yeah the next

556
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:06,620
slide was thank you and if you have

557
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,810
another process I were to answer it we

558
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:11,960
have an additional five minutes one

559
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:18,370
moment one moment welcome

560
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:22,130
we live in Connecticut again yeah those

561
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:30,650
guy over there now when I see when I see

562
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:33,650
the purchase option it was using crypto

563
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:35,840
currency of course I'm not sure if it

564
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,180
was Bitcoin or other snap the script the

565
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:38,870
currency

566
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:45,320
I love you are tarnishing self-aware I'm

567
00:29:45,320 --> 00:30:00,530
attacking the last class okay no one no

568
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:04,400
actually didn't do it or whether the

569
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,710
time working at Akamai so it's not

570
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:09,040
allowed

571
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:18,800
I didn't do that um someone else yes

572

this is the thank you slide and yeah

573
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:28,370
around the month round must understand

574
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:34,460
it and then nights nights yeah I figure

575
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:38,540
out the the the telegram bought in 88 10

576
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:42,310
p.m. something or other

577
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:49,360
yeah can you raise your voice please

578
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:01,820
so he asked how can how we make sure

579
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:04,370
that this person in the picture is

580
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:06,049
actually the person that stands behind

581
00:31:06,049 --> 00:31:10,070
the fishing kit so to be honest we know

582
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:13,790
I'm not 100% sure about that but the

583
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:17,000
same name is applied and it's been

584
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,510
viewed in several places and social

585
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:23,059
networks it can be also his next name

586
00:31:23,059 --> 00:31:25,340
right and they used some pictures but

587
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,049
the variety of the pictures we have a

588
00:31:27,049 --> 00:31:30,860
picture of him riding a bike yeah so the

589
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:34,760
variety of the pictures may may point on

590
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:39,650
some very point that is a real guy and

591
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:42,620
not a fake one but we're not sure about

592
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:49,030
it I think the last question maybe

593
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:53,350
anyone yeah

594
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,970
go ahead

595
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:14,960
excuse me yeah

596
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:51,730
okay so I need to cut you off

597
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:55,450
excuse me okay so that was me and this

598
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:57,010
is what the sixteen shop fishing kit I

599
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:59,760
hope you enjoy it

600
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,000
[Applause]
