1
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:24,590
everything I've seen in 20 years of

2
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:27,180
running the security team at DEFCON

3
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,570
which as you can imagine has been crazy

4
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,050
right every possible insane thing you

5
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,380
can imagine has happened and some things

6
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,770
you probably can't imagine - so I've

7
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,340
been hacking since the 80s member of the

8
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,829
British hacking group agents of a

9
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:48,690
hostile power fact I was one of the

10
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,719
founders member of the CBC's ninja

11
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,550
strike force

12
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,270
I organized hope and hope to K early I

13
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,149
was the only joint staff member between

14
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:03,199
hope and DEFCON which was challenging

15
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,439
and I'm not the head of network security

16
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,000
DEFCON because there is actually a

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,409
separate network team I'm the head of

18
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,619
security which we hit a lot more

19
00:01:15,619 --> 00:01:20,880
hey my first Def Con was the plaza which

20
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,990
was around DEFCON 6 and I walked in and

21
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,570
the elevators to the Plaza Hotel opened

22
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:30,090
and inside the elevators were the

23
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,530
satellite dishes from the roof of the

24
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,450
hotel riding up and down and I thought

25
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:42,479
these are my people I went upstairs and

26
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,170
they've been remodeling the hotel and

27
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:49,560
they had these new smoke alarms

28
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,420
installed and they'd been putting a mark

29
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,820
on the ceiling and someone pulled one

30
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,229
down and they were working out what to

31
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:57,229
do with it so they caught the elevator

32
00:01:57,229 --> 00:02:00,740
threw it in the elevator and press down

33
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,060
it goes down

34
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,760
and then pulls every single smoke alarm

35
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,940
off a ceiling all the way around the

36
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,919
hotel you can hear the Pops as they're

37
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:14,940
coming down we had to escort Jeff Moss

38
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:19,470
out of the hotel in a phalanx of people

39
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,470
around him but Jeff muscles the founder

40
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,620
of Def Con because the hotel wanted hit

41
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,810
speak to him the FBI wanted to speak to

42
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,330
him the police wanted to speak to him

43
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,489
and I'm sure quite a few other people on

44
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:37,160
the speech that was my first Def Con you

45
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,610
probably know my hacks more than you

46
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,330
know me so I hacked a ton of mobile

47
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,250
phones I used to work for Vodafone spent

48
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,080
10 years I had developed the first

49
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,500
mobile phone exploit on an old Nokia

50
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,040
feature phone and I hacked Google glass

51
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,900
not long after it came out that's

52
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,220
actually one of the ones I'm most proud

53
00:02:59,220 --> 00:02:59,489
of

54
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:02,280
I developed an image that if you looked

55
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,900
at it with Google glass at hacked glass

56
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,980
I immediately wrote to Neil Stevenson

57
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:12,200
and told him I've done snow crash

58
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:20,209
touch ID I gone into a race with

59
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:24,900
Starbuck from CCC the race was who could

60
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,430
hack touch ID first

61
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,519
he had a four or five hour lead because

62
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,640
of time zones I hacked it within 12

63
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,860
hours and bypassed it to be fair it's

64
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,590
one of those classic if I have seen far

65
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,880
it's because I've stood on the shoulders

66
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,450
of giants I leveraged research done by a

67
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:49,170
very very bright Japanese researcher who

68
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,630
had worked out how to build imitation

69
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:55,079
fingerprints using molds based out of

70
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:58,590
edged PCB boards and I essentially copy

71
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,870
the same technique the only bits I had

72
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,730
it was I lifted a fingerprint off of a

73
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:05,430
glass duplicated it used the mold

74
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:08,069
created it and owned it and then when

75
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:09,390
they brought out the updated version

76
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,880
which was I think the 6s I hacked that

77
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:18,089
after four hours improvement oh the

78
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:22,680
Tesla Model S that was fun so I hacked

79
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,020
it's actually two years for for Chris

80
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,060
and Charlie did theirs but I spent two

81
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,490
years working with Tesla trying to get

82
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:32,580
them to fix the bugs but and our game

83
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,080
faces a little bit with some other stuff

84
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,729
because all the bugs were ranked as

85
00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:38,220
medium or low they didn't see them as

86
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:43,139
important now the reality is the way we

87
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:45,090
classify bugs is bad and we have to

88
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,400
think about this because I can take a

89
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,979
bunch of low bucks and if each bug gives

90
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:52,380
me an inch and I can use enough of them

91
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,320
I can take a mile and what happened with

92
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,539
the case of the Tesla was I was able to

93
00:04:57,539 --> 00:04:59,910
leverage a bunch of very low rated bugs

94
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:03,830
and then drive alongs car with my iPhone

95
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:09,200
he wasn't impressed he fired a CIL

96
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,770
face ID almost I couldn't I can break

97
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:17,110
facial recognition on Android I can

98
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:20,770
break it on Microsoft and I'm this close

99
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:22,420
to breaking it

100
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,570
Apple is actually super friendly about

101
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,790
this they've been talking to me and and

102
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,310
they're built a really good system but I

103
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,920
know it can be broken because I believe

104
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,780
anything man makes man can break and

105
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,660
that's something that all of you hackers

106
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,590
also now and finally I've been doing a

107
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,600
lot of other car stuff and tire pressure

108
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,190
measurement systems is one of my player

109
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,580
is at the moment and did you know

110
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,710
military vehicles have a tire pressure

111
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,060
measurement system that will also

112
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,420
inflate cars we also inflate the tires

113
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,070
you can spoof the signal to tell it that

114
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:01,150
the tyre is deflated none of the signal

115
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:05,590
is encoded it has a simple 32 bit up to

116
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:08,740
a 128-bit ID sold you know the frequency

117
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,690
in you can transmit you can replay and

118
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:13,150
if you transit as I see nothing going on

119
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,980
here and and if you try to keep

120
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,390
transmitting it you can end up with a

121
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:19,590
military vehicle with really big tires

122
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:24,430
they don't like that and I'll also say

123
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:27,729
visit for another talk but everything is

124
00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:30,669
going to change from 2020 I've been

125
00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:33,430
working deep with a bunch of automotive

126
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:36,460
industry bodies and on a few other

127
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:41,289
expert areas and between everybody who's

128
00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:42,310
been working on this

129
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:45,310
the car is goods the more automotive as

130
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,629
you know it it's going to fundamentally

131
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:49,090
change which just means the game's

132
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:55,120
all-star game so yeah 20 years of

133
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,270
hacking DEFCON I've seen a lot

134
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,770
recruitment by the mob they threw a

135
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:04,659
party they hired the bellagio top floor

136
00:07:04,659 --> 00:07:08,020
of it threw a party known by Def Con

137
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,909
staffers the hookers and blow party and

138
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:12,279
they invited all of the young hackers

139
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:13,960
they could find to come to this party

140
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,029
basically so that he'd get compromised

141
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:19,599
on and unfortunately some people went we

142
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,120
tried to spread the word like don't go

143
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,639
you're an idiot but a few people went

144
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,680
that that was a thing

145
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,949
fake ATMs that's fake ATM that was found

146
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:34,779
in in Def Con it stopped working after a

147
00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:37,510
while no idea why

148
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:42,730
hacked hotel locks Oh God last year some

149
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,500
of you may know I resigned last year

150
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,390
because of this I was told I'm not

151
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:49,270
allowed to resign I was told by my

152
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,680
entire department that if I resigned

153
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,190
they would resign and but the challenge

154
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:57,010
there was not only were the security

155
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,930
people in the hotel going into rooms

156
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:02,860
which was bad but they had implemented

157
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:07,360
the most insane lock system using RFID

158
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,240
they're taken my fare cards the

159
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,340
originally using Mifare classic which is

160
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:16,060
broken and rather than bothering to just

161
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:19,900
spend the extra 20 cents per card to

162
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,900
move to the Mifare plus standard which

163
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,980
is more secure

164
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,890
they decided we'll do away with keys

165
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:30,070
completely so all the data blocks on the

166
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:32,590
car are over and instead they generate a

167
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,860
hash using the room number check out

168
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,309
information and a random nonce from the

169
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:43,330
hotels and I now have I believe enough

170
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:46,210
cards I've got about two and a half

171
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:48,750
thousand don't ask me how I go on and

172
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,640
I'm going to build a rainbow table and

173
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,800
let you have a look I don't think what

174
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,490
we can find out

175
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:57,310
but the problem it doesn't just affect

176
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:00,400
what the Caesars Hotels it affects the

177
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,740
whole vase I stayed at MGM a few months

178
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:03,220
ago

179
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:07,570
same deal and what this means is while

180
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:10,240
it's difficult to make a new card I hate

181
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,530
to get into a room that you're not part

182
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:13,240
of because you have to know how to make

183
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,720
the hash copying a card you can copy any

184
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,570
card with the proxmark in less than a

185
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:21,430
second because there's nothing stopping

186
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:24,310
you and so rooms were getting

187
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,260
burglarized because people were copying

188
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:29,770
made skis accessing rooms and

189
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,920
burglarizing so when you hear about the

190
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,990
confiscated soldering irons and things

191
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:35,560
like that

192
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,170
no that wasn't security that was the

193
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:42,360
thieves and we have to solve that so

194
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,860
more fun

195
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,870
yeah and obviously almost every kind of

196
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:50,570
hack you imagine every year I spend time

197
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:53,510
trying to stop someone from going to

198
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,120
jail because they heard some it really

199
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,710
cooler to organ decided to play it

200
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:00,820
probably the one of the saddest was

201
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,350
couple goes to the Vegas couple gets

202
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,210
married in Vegas on their honeymoon

203
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:07,580
night husband decides to show off his

204
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:10,670
skills and hacks a an ATM in the middle

205
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:11,540
of the casino floor

206
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,460
the casino floor which is the most

207
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,730
surveilled piece of land in the world

208
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:19,070
and gets picked up within minutes and he

209
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:21,710
gets taken in and they're deciding

210
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,540
whether or not prosecutors they call me

211
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,730
and I my job is to talk them down make

212
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,410
sure he doesn't get prosecuted because I

213
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:31,250
like to see hackers go to jail but then

214
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,530
they took they say well we're going to

215
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:35,900
trespass you at least and they turned to

216
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,760
his wife and say but we're not going to

217
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,320
trespass you you can stay if you want

218
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,710
and she sat there for a minute and

219
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:46,280
genuinely thought about it I don't blame

220
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:54,170
her well yeah

221
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:59,410
so slides have gone a bit weird and but

222
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:02,780
the public today is really aware of

223
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,570
cyber security right way more than they

224
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,010
ever were before part of that's because

225
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:09,350
of the stuff we see on TV part of that's

226
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,620
because the amount of breaches we have

227
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,910
but we have a really long way to go

228
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,800
because there's so much misinformation

229
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,540
floating around and there's so much

230
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,650
misconception

231
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:21,650
it doesn't necessarily help and the

232
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:25,190
reality is if we want to solve these

233
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:28,760
problems we as a community can solve

234
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,580
this problems but we need to arm the

235
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:35,420
rest of the citizens with the tools to

236
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,540
do this because we can't scale they're

237
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,430
not often enough of us to solve these

238
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:43,880
problems but if we can take people and

239
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,340
arm them with at least the basic tools

240
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,890
to solve the basic problems then we can

241
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:50,800
focus on the complicated problems and

242
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,200
the way we do that is we teach people to

243
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,730
think like hackers

244
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,379
and that doesn't mean teaching to be

245
00:11:57,379 --> 00:11:59,720
super technical it means teaching them

246
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,329
to be inquisitive I mean teaching them

247
00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:04,279
to challenge things it means teaching

248
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:06,139
them to think outside the box and I

249
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:07,730
think it's a 100 percent doable

250
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:10,549
but and I'll get to in a minute there's

251
00:12:10,549 --> 00:12:11,779
a big challenge there and that's

252
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:19,910
educational so this is just insane

253
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:24,290
right the most simple hacks are the ones

254
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:27,169
that bring everything down every breach

255
00:12:27,169 --> 00:12:31,160
you hear about right it's simple it's a

256
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,919
phishing attack it's someone left a USB

257
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,629
stick it's someone inserted something

258
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,669
into a network we're not talking about

259
00:12:37,669 --> 00:12:40,069
apts we're not talking about cyber

260
00:12:40,069 --> 00:12:42,379
weapons we're talking about stupidity

261
00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:45,889
and yet company after company fall to

262
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:52,989
this black hat three years ago fell to

263
00:12:52,989 --> 00:12:55,459
USB sticks when I say black I mean

264
00:12:55,459 --> 00:12:58,100
attendees a black cap some guy shows up

265
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,709
throws a bunch of your speed sticks down

266
00:13:00,709 --> 00:13:03,829
in black hat and you think black hat

267
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:06,410
okay this is a pretty savvy audience

268
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:10,850
right now they plugged them all into

269
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:14,029
their laptops the next day the guy shows

270
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:16,429
up and he redistributes the

271
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:19,850
more USB sticks this time containing all

272
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:22,309
the files he exfiltrated from the other

273
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:26,809
people's laptops and I'm not allowed to

274
00:13:26,809 --> 00:13:29,179
say how many federal agents got caught

275
00:13:29,179 --> 00:13:37,160
out bad this what happens in Vegas

276
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,020
doesn't necessarily stay in Vegas

277
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,270
what happens in Vegas sometimes causes

278
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,959
an international incident

279
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,149
don't don't ask me about area 51 and

280
00:13:48,149 --> 00:13:53,160
balloons you cannot really read this

281
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,649
very much but what this is is a storm of

282
00:13:55,649 --> 00:13:58,589
deals what happened last year was some

283
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:03,270
smartass decided to use DEFCON as cover

284
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:07,050
to do a heist and so what they did was

285
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,850
they got modified mobile devices I

286
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,770
believed they were Nexus 5 but in the

287
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:11,880
hundreds of the shorts I didn't get a

288
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,860
close look and they tipped off the FBI

289
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:19,050
that dethkones badge makers were issuing

290
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:22,170
badges that would do deals and then they

291
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:24,870
were dealing the backhaul for some of

292
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:27,180
the slot machines because even though

293
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,770
it's illegal for slot machines to have a

294
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:30,209
wireless backhaul they're supposed to be

295
00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:30,690
wide

296
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,220
some of them do because they have to

297
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,170
move them around and so they were

298
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,390
knocking these slot machines off the

299
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,730
network and then man in the middling

300
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:40,680
them so they could put fake vouchers or

301
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,630
replay vouchers through and just keep

302
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:45,660
running and make money meanwhile the FBI

303
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,209
and the hotel security of running around

304
00:14:48,209 --> 00:14:50,579
with these big yellow flukes and of

305
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:52,800
course every time they see a guy looking

306
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,180
like an official with a big yellow

307
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,370
detection thing they put the phone in

308
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,230
the pocket and no one catches it

309
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,440
I grabbed Kristen Padgett and we went

310
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,300
downstairs with the laptop running a bun

311
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,550
to picked up the biggest antennas we

312
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,620
could find in the vendor area and we sat

313
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,230
in the bar and drank beer and captured

314
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:13,140
this and not only did we capture all of

315
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,029
the dof packets but we also caught them

316
00:15:15,029 --> 00:15:16,829
logging into their s3 buckets and a few

317
00:15:16,829 --> 00:15:24,709
other things don't mess with my family

318
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:33,790
[Applause]

319
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:37,760
things are moving faster all the time it

320
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,880
used to be that you would see

321
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,690
vulnerabilities come out and sit around

322
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,540
for years not much happen with them but

323
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,770
criminals have worked out how to

324
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:48,320
monetize stuff and the monetization is

325
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,040
accelerating things you see in in

326
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,690
malware world like banking Trojans where

327
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,680
organizations them set themselves up

328
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,600
like enterprises and they turn money

329
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,600
back into R&D and they churn out new

330
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,580
pieces of malware all the time well it's

331
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,040
anything with hardware and the good

332
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,150
example here is the key fob relay attack

333
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:14,540
how many of you are familiar with it ok

334
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,700
so the key fob you use to gain access

335
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:20,030
your car is just a radio device it

336
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,710
doesn't really have any special security

337
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,330
other than the fact that has a rolling

338
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:26,660
code to authenticate if you put a

339
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:29,780
repeater between your key fob which can

340
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,780
be in your bedroom and your car which

341
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,220
can be in a car park a few hundred

342
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,230
meters away you can regulate the

343
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:39,170
connection and your car opens and they

344
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:43,820
drive off they're now seeing 10 20

345
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,670
percent of vehicle thefts in San

346
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:49,400
Francisco as a direct result of key fob

347
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:54,530
attacks because it's easy and here's

348
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:57,190
where it gets kept it was theorized in

349
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:01,100
2010 theorized but not even a proper

350
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,900
prototype built and then unicorn team

351
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:09,260
built their first demo I think in 2012

352
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:13,189
and then they build another demo in 2013

353
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:18,470
that cost $20 to make that's the $20

354
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:24,230
version within six months of that you

355
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:27,050
can go onto various dark websites you

356
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:29,090
can go onto google and you can buy these

357
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:33,440
devices for $100 a shot so that's

358
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,100
three years from theory to production

359
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:41,960
and use by active criminals hey we're

360
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,150
behind the curve and somehow we have to

361
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:49,910
get ahead of the curve I wanted to put

362
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:53,690
up a picture of what the media thinks of

363
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:56,420
hackers like there are just some people

364
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:01,600
here who really just aren't hackers

365
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,330
sorry I have a bit of a beef with Julian

366
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:10,640
Assange I've known him for years he's an

367
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,300


368
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:14,390
sorry anyway but this is what the media

369
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:16,520
think we are and that's a problem

370
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,670
because as long as they think we're like

371
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:23,150
this you'll never get big enterprises or

372
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:25,070
governments to really truly trust us I

373
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:28,580
work in in the US and I work with the US

374
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:31,640
government and I work with all sorts of

375
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,440
folks I even work with my own government

376
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,840
the UK government through the US

377
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,570
government because I can't work with the

378
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:40,550
UK government because I'm a hacker and

379
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:50,210
they don't trust me somehow we have to

380
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:53,060
destroy this image that we are a bunch

381
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,700
of and Rick people realize that

382
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,370
we can actually help solve problems

383
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,990
because until we do that we can't help

384
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,670
solve some of the other bigger problems

385
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:04,970
and I'm incredibly proud to be speaking

386
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:07,790
here because Israel is one of the few

387
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:10,490
countries I have seen that gets it and

388
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:14,770
that consistently turns out

389
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:17,450
jaw-droppingly good cybersecurity

390
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:20,570
professionals with the exception of

391
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:22,810
Gaddy

392
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,430
[Applause]

393
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:36,340
this is why I did mr. robot really a

394
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:39,910
cat5 from a jumbo jet into a Ferrari

395
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:51,520
into a laptop what really what parent

396
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,180
they did it

397
00:19:52,180 --> 00:20:01,480
I can't watch CSI cyber because I throw

398
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,200
things at the TV that's why I got into

399
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,810
mr. robot because I wanted to make sure

400
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:10,510
the hacks on the TV didn't make me break

401
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:13,390
things and my wife fully endorsed it

402
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:15,190
because she's tired of me breaking

403
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:18,000
things and punching all of the stuff and

404
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,580
and mr. robot I see what they do is

405
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:24,640
nothing special the issue us a script

406
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,850
and instead of saying and they do this

407
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:30,430
and this happens they leave a hole they

408
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,690
say we would like this to happen

409
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:34,990
and I'm not the only expert there are a

410
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:37,660
team of experts and we all get together

411
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,610
and talk about stuff and we theorize

412
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,500
what the best way is to deal with this

413
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,600
stuff and we come up with the best hacks

414
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,530
and they don't always like it because

415
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:50,290
that's always really complicated so for

416
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,990
example they wanted Elliott to steal a

417
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:53,530
Zipcar

418
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:55,990
at one point and you won't see it in the

419
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,190
show because they didn't make the cut

420
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:01,000
because they didn't like my idea and so

421
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,410
for those of you don't know was it guys

422
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:05,590
it's a basically a rental bike car like

423
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,720
those horrible scooters you see lying

424
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,750
around everywhere you go up with a RFID

425
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,760
card press it up against the windscreen

426
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,920
it dials back with a modem and validates

427
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,880
whether or not you're allowed to get

428
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,100
into the car that then unlocks the car

429
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,770
you get in the keys to the car chained

430
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:22,480
to the steering column so you just press

431
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,890
Start and drive off okay so they wanted

432
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:29,080
us to hack into the company and get

433
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,320
bypass the firewall and add in an

434
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,420
account and make an infinite card I

435
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,160
wanted to put a brick through the window

436
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,070
and get in the car

437
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:43,200
[Laughter]

438
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:52,480
that's hacking hacking is smart and

439
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:59,340
hacking is lazy information warfare is

440
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,750
probably the thing that scares me the

441
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:05,320
most because everything's changed

442
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,929
all these bucks that we have written off

443
00:22:07,929 --> 00:22:12,610
for decades as information are now

444
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:15,760
potentially critical whether it leaks a

445
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,260
piece of information that could be used

446
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,299
or whether it allows you to put

447
00:22:19,299 --> 00:22:21,520
information up somewhere it's

448
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,940
potentially a problem if I've gone to a

449
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:27,520
car company five years ago and said I

450
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,620
have a bug that lets me put up a smiley

451
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,840
face on your dashboard they'd laugh at

452
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:37,059
me and say won't fix well take a look at

453
00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:40,990
that it is not hard and this gentleman

454
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:43,600
can confirm that to display that kind of

455
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,669
information of an infotainment system in

456
00:22:45,669 --> 00:22:48,700
any kind of transport system including

457
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,790
airplanes then you imagine if I put that

458
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:55,150
on every airplane in the United States

459
00:22:55,150 --> 00:23:00,820
simultaneously dude haven't you been

460
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:04,470
banned from enough and boys

461
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:09,310
but just with an informational lowres

462
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:13,110
bug you could ground the entire US

463
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:17,970
commercial airline fleet that means we

464
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:20,350
that means we really need to start

465
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:24,220
thinking about what is context mean in

466
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:28,750
this stuff the other problem is the way

467
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,480
many of these companies are addressing

468
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:47,440
fake news and my eye on you the way

469
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,390
companies the way companies are

470
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:51,340
addressing this stuff though it's not

471
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,900
gonna work right

472
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,150
Twitter sort of started going in the

473
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,530
right direction with their shadow

474
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:58,920
banning which they now deny exists

475
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,090
preventing the propagation of some of

476
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:03,340
this stuff is one of the right ways to

477
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:06,100
handle it deleting it is the best way to

478
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,200
handle it but ok you know I understand

479
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,480
there are potential issues there but if

480
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,120
you have harmful misinformation you need

481
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,700
to do something about it and Facebook's

482
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,400
response to say well we believe it's

483
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,720
part of the conversation we're going to

484
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,630
leave it but put a warning on it is

485
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:24,040
absolutely the wrong thing to do because

486
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,980
putting a warning on something has never

487
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,540
stopped it from being distributed in

488
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,850
fact if you put a warning on it I'm a

489
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:34,889
hundred times more likely to look at it

490
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:40,540
education this is the really important

491
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,870
thing when I moved to America I was

492
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:45,940
stunned I live in San Francisco

493
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:48,520
I moved originally to Silicon Valley I

494
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:53,080
started a company none of the schools in

495
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,410
Silicon Valley offer computing classes

496
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:59,650
none the schools outside Google don't

497
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:04,540
have laptops what this is insane

498
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:07,270
we have children who are graduating from

499
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:10,450
schools who are not prepared for the

500
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:12,160
world they're moving into and they're

501
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,200
going to be the victims of tomorrow and

502
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,670
here's Oakland it's completely avoidable

503
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:20,780
and this is dumb like why and at the

504
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:24,800
same time these kids if we educate them

505
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,520
are the army who can take down the

506
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,300
disinformation because they're way more

507
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:35,180
connected and way more switched on to

508
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:38,000
online material than we'll ever hope to

509
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,540
be

510
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,070
I watched my 11 year old daughter

511
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:43,010
sitting on the sofa with three devices

512
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:45,560
simultaneously playing roblox on one

513
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,720
talking to a friend on another and

514
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,940
abusing other people on our and it's

515
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:53,090
like either understand the context

516
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:55,430
switching they're born with it there its

517
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:58,790
inherent we need to harness it and the

518
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:02,000
other thing is if we want to keep young

519
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,910
hacker kids out of jail we need to find

520
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:07,250
them we need to train them and when it's

521
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:09,950
harness them right now there was a 16

522
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:13,880
year old kid in America who is facing 16

523
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,370
felonies for sending phishing emails to

524
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:20,420
his school to change his grades that

525
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:25,540
cannot keep happening it's ridiculous

526
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:29,960
Owen I'm sorry I want to mention they're

527
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:35,420
not Karen I believe that children just

528
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:38,800
by caucus can be the immunity of the

529
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:45,440
internet system so conclusion our

530
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,100
democracy really has been hacked and in

531
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,710
many ways we've let it I think we've

532
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,480
seen a lot of this stuff go on and we

533
00:26:53,480 --> 00:27:04,880
haven't taken any action I mean hacking

534
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,380
back is one thing and but but the voting

535
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,600
machines are not the problem it's great

536
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,860
they bring them to DEFCON and they

537
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,450
analyze them and they find

538
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:15,770
vulnerabilities and they make them run

539
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:17,690
doom and silly stuff like that right

540
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:18,530
that's great

541
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:20,960
love to see it that we get five

542
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,730
congressmen at DEFCON every year that's

543
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:23,810
fantastic

544
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:26,600
we get all sorts of people from every

545
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,520
kind of part of the government you can

546
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,320
imagine that

547
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,590
great but those aren't the problems

548
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,100
affecting things

549
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:36,250
it's disinformation that's polarizing

550
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:38,830
people and giving them the wrong idea

551
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:42,580
about the world and politicians and

552
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:45,490
policies that's the problem and somehow

553
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:47,170
we have to suppress that and stop

554
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:49,300
foreign nations from being able to

555
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,930
inject their propaganda into our systems

556
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:55,330
and until we start focusing on that

557
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:59,910
we're not going to stop the problem and

558
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:02,860
as as I mentioned we need to rethink how

559
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:05,470
we classify threats our and as a last

560
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:08,290
thing the 90s would really like their

561
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:13,900
vulnerabilities back please thank you

562
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,989
[Music]

563
00:28:23,739 --> 00:28:27,889
thank you so much mark would you would

564
00:28:27,889 --> 00:28:29,509
you be willing to take a few questions

565
00:28:29,509 --> 00:28:30,529
from our audience

566
00:28:30,529 --> 00:28:33,440
absolutely okay just one thing questions

567
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,119
about crazy that happened to Def

568
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:38,539
Con come with a price buy me an alcohol

569
00:28:38,539 --> 00:28:41,509
alone tell you everything you don't even

570
00:28:41,509 --> 00:28:43,489
have to buy the alcohol you can join us

571
00:28:43,489 --> 00:28:45,830
at the after-party where we have beers

572
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:55,940
and as you can see so a mark let's take

573
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,739
some questions from the audience anybody

574
00:28:57,739 --> 00:29:01,539
has a question mark your choice I

575
00:29:44,499 --> 00:29:47,359
actually had this very conversation a

576
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:49,849
week ago I had a very interesting

577
00:29:49,849 --> 00:29:53,899
presentation it was me a climate change

578
00:29:53,899 --> 00:29:56,690
expert who's trying to fix New Orleans

579
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:59,539
and a professor of biology and we're

580
00:29:59,539 --> 00:30:01,580
talking about availability of

581
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,080
information and he believes firmly that

582
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,239
certain piece of information should be

583
00:30:05,239 --> 00:30:07,580
restricted and not passed out I believe

584
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,889
as a hacker that knowledge is power and

585
00:30:09,889 --> 00:30:12,440
I believe also that sunlight is the best

586
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,830
disinfectant the sheer fact that these

587
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:18,710
things can cause harm is because there

588
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:21,320
are problems that they affect bringing

589
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,029
them out into the light it's one of the

590
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:24,979
reasons why I fought with many others

591
00:30:24,979 --> 00:30:27,259
for Responsible and then coordinated

592
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:30,200
disclosure throughout the 90s it's the

593
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,119
only way you will get these things fixed

594
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:35,520
is to make them known and so I think

595
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,290
I think it's perfectly okay for that

596
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:42,560
stuff to be out there huh

597
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:46,890
because fake news is a different harm

598
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:50,910
like a vulnerability or a tool that

599
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:53,100
exploits of vulnerability is exploiting

600
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,710
a specific floor that can be fixed fake

601
00:30:55,710 --> 00:31:00,180
news the floor is an ISO layer 8 problem

602
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,800
it's a problem between the keyboard and

603
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:05,760
the seat and that's much harder to fix

604
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,090
I'm not a psychologist I only play one

605
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:14,300
on TV I'm not going to sit down and

606
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:17,580
counsel every person in the world now

607
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,980
we absolutely do have to think along

608
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,930
those lines and come up with a way to

609
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:24,600
teach people to recognise fake news and

610
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,870
to challenge what they see totally agree

611
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:31,530
but until we do that thus next safest

612
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:36,090
course is to castrate it stop it from

613
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:36,920
spreading

614
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:40,260
maybe delete it if it's bad enough if

615
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,190
it's a lie

616
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:44,250
why should it be allowed to propagate if

617
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:47,910
it's a disjointed perspective then maybe

618
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:49,230
there's a different conversation to be

619
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:53,640
had but I don't claim that it's an easy

620
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,130
solution if it was an easy solution with

621
00:31:56,130 --> 00:32:18,150
a fixer no comment and if any of you

622
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:19,440
remember the end of season 2 the

623
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:19,950
femtocell

624
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:25,140
I still have it at home it really upset

625
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:30,110
the FBI because it worked

626
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:42,120
hey Christian Padgett lives a few miles

627
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,710
away from me so we sort of get together

628
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:47,690
and try to take over the world

629
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,760
so my usual rate my usual rate for

630
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:30,240
administrative support is $15.00 an hour

631
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,650
I know the guys who wrote it if you ping

632
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:36,240
me the question I can certainly forward

633
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,910
on some I don't use colleague and the

634
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:41,670
reason I Carly is convenient it's nice

635
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:43,020
it's got a lot of tools in one place

636
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:46,590
however I build custom builds with the

637
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:49,440
right tools for the right project so for

638
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,240
example I have mobile phones with

639
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,000
partial Carly builds on them that look

640
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,920
like ordinary phones but have some of

641
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:59,040
the Carly tools they will go through any

642
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,780
security check you can take him into

643
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:03,000
secure locations and still do stuff

644
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,340
Carly on the other hand if you walk into

645
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,080
a lot of places - Carly you're gonna get

646
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:11,460
spotted so I do it slightly differently

647
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,530
and so I can't answer you immediately

648
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:19,640
but happy to help you get the answer one

649
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,339
[Music]

650
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:49,090
so that's why we developed responsible

651
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:51,400
disclosure and coordinated disclosure to

652
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,900
put pressure on the companies to fix

653
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:56,199
tough and brutally honest I didn't start

654
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:58,440
out white I started out as a black cap

655
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,060
and some of the vulnerabilities I found

656
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:03,940
I didn't want fixed my favorite

657
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:06,850
vulnerability this is going to date me

658
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:08,890
and maybe date anyone who understands it

659
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:11,530
does anyone know what hosts are equiv is

660
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:16,240
on a UNIX box Soho started quit was a

661
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,340
configuration file that says any system

662
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:20,530
in that file can login with root

663
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:23,950
privileges without a password what I

664
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:27,070
discovered and this was long before dank

665
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:29,290
Minsky was that you could modify bind

666
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:32,620
and allow it to send out whatever

667
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:35,920
address he wanted and so I spoofed my IP

668
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,820
address to always be the hash symbol

669
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:41,380
what's the first entry in any config

670
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:49,920
file I had root on the Internet

671
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,700
and it lasted for a few years but yeah

672
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,100
back then blackhat didn't bring you

673
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,560
money and all it brought you was a path

674
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:03,010
that led to prison and I got married I

675
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:07,150
got children and so I changed and but

676
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:10,480
back to your answer you have to put

677
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,370
pressure and there are organizations

678
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:14,470
that will help you put pressure be

679
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:18,220
familiar with the e FF Electronic

680
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,710
Frontier Foundation Eva from the FF was

681
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:23,140
our first opening speaker today Eva from

682
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,990
the FF is here if you find her torture

683
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:28,270
she's phenomenal the FF as an

684
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:31,600
organization I consult them before every

685
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,210
major hack I did and they helped me go

686
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:36,310
after the companies they shield me from

687
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:38,260
the company's lawyers because many times

688
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:41,230
they try to sue you and they guide me in

689
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:44,370
the path to get the best resolution I

690
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:46,330
absolutely support that recommendation

691
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:48,370
speak to the FF speak to other

692
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:50,370
organizations that can help you do

693
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:55,080
responsible disclosure coordinated

694
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,580
disclosure the difference between we

695
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,110
support the difference between

696
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:01,030
responsible disclosure and coordinators

697
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:02,860
closures responsible disclosure was

698
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:05,770
assigning a defined time line giving a

699
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:08,260
company control over when you're going

700
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:10,780
to drop the band hammer on them if they

701
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:11,620
didn't fix it

702
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:14,830
well that doesn't work because you don't

703
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:16,150
know how long it's gonna take to fix

704
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:18,100
some things you might assign a time with

705
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,460
30 days but it might take the 90

706
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:23,020
coordinated disclosure means you engage

707
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:26,350
with them and establish a process to set

708
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:28,930
a time that they can work with Katy

709
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:32,020

710
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:35,080
