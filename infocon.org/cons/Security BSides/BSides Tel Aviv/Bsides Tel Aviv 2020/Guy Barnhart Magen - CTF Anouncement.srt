1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,270
okay hi everyone both here and at home

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,120
and thank you very much for all the time

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,649
and effort you spend to stay with us

4
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:09,719
throughout the day so today I want to

5
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:12,000
talk about the city F that we've had

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,969
earlier this week we've set the CD F for

7
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:17,100
Sunday and Monday for a very specific

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,680
reason unlike previous years we've

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,910
decided to make the CD F more global and

10
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,580
more appealing in our online community

11
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,039
which we are all experiencing today due

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,520
to the co viet 19 crisis this crisis

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,469
affects everyone everybody's life is

14
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:37,260
changed my own life has changed and it

15
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,270
touches everyone he touched member of

16
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,399
the CTF team he touched members of the

17
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:43,200
family so everybody knows someone was

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,239
affected by the Covenant in one way or

19
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,430
another on the other hand a lot of

20
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,920
people are staying home which allowed

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,719
them an opportunity to participate in

22
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,730
the city F and we reached some pretty

23
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,309
amazing results this year first and

24
00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:59,520
foremost I want to thank our very

25
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,329
wonderful sponsors the hack the Box hack

26
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,309
the box company that provided us with

27
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:07,860
the city of sponsorship and while

28
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,360
they're not very well known here in this

29
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,920
world I did want to present some numbers

30
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,890
to help people get more familiar with

31
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,290
them they're a platform that help people

32
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,290
measure up their security skills play

33
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:20,939
around with different kinds of CDF's

34
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:24,030
challenges and boxes and overall a very

35
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,220
fun experience if you're into that sort

36
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,409
of thing and being the organizer of the

37
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:30,390
CTF I am and I can recommend everyone

38
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,320
else try them out so usually I start the

39
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,299
city of talk with some statistics to

40
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,140
give us a sense of how our CDF went this

41
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,950
year in previous years we had roughly

42
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,570
130 users playing the CTF with around 40

43
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:52,200
to 20 to 40 active teams we grew over

44
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,630
time but this year really blew us out

45
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,420
blow us out both by the capacity of the

46
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,040
team to create interesting challenges

47
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,750
but also by the number of users that

48
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,899
were actually there we had 20 challenges

49
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:05,670
20 interesting challenges spending

50
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,879
different kind of domains from

51
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:10,949
cryptography to forensics to web

52
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:13,500
application security to doing web

53
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,190
assembly

54
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,310
and other types of challenges we had an

55
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,820
enormous amount of users over 5000 IP

56
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:24,830
addresses translating into 1367

57
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:27,120
registered users to our web to our

58
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,380
competition obviously users competing

59
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,580
teams but even here 793 teams registered

60
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,040
to the CDF and the statistic which I

61
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,060
find most compelling is that 125 people

62
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,790
solved at least teams more specifically

63
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,400
solved at least one challenge and that

64
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,500
means that at least 125 teams were

65
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,380
engaged in our CTF trying to work

66
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,720
through our challenges they only had 48

67
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,200
hours to do so another thing that was

68
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,720
pretty amazing was the distribution of

69
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,480
people where did people connect to our

70
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,960
services to play at the CDF I ran under

71
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,670
the assumption that most people will

72
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,890
come from Israel because besides Tel

73
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,980
Aviv is obviously a local event however

74
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,200
which you can see from this nice graphic

75
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,020
that's not true we had people from all

76
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,500
over the world competing in our CPF the

77
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,330
most amazing part was that Israel wasn't

78
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,209
even number one it's number four

79
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:28,950
preceding preceded by United Kingdom

80
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,500
United States Singapore and then by

81
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,650
Netherlands Oman France Japan Italy and

82
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:40,650
South Korea and translating to over 1300

83
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:45,510
people connecting to our CTF from 5000

84
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,720
different IP addresses amazing

85
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,450
we provided the one or several of the

86
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:53,970
challenges as downloaded the local

87
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:57,810
offline challenges for you and we we've

88
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:00,540
seen two point and terabyte of data

89
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,350
downloaded from our servers exactly and

90
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:07,290
this is all ruies fault so next time

91
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,820
when were you tells you no I just said I

92
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,040
just need an s3 link to upload a couple

93
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,380
of challenges it would be fine don't

94
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:17,220
believe him more than that we had around

95
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,399
30 percent correct solves which is also

96
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,770
very interesting to me because one of

97
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,110
the most interesting thing interesting

98
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,669
things about this correct solves is

99
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:27,900
obviously

100
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,419
answers which are wrong and we'll get

101
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:33,930
back to that later unlike previous years

102
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,850
we had two challenges that remain

103
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,220
unsolved which is why we keep the city s

104
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,960
running right now and all the way

105
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,729
through Sunday to give people the

106
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:44,789
opportunity to keep trying against these

107
00:04:44,789 --> 00:04:48,870
unsolved challenges the two challenges

108
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:52,169
are jailbreak and capella and we will

109
00:04:52,169 --> 00:04:54,289
get back to them as well

110
00:04:54,289 --> 00:04:57,630
so like every CTF year a lot of funny

111
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,759
things happen throughout the CTF even

112
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,350
though it was limited only to two days

113
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,380
and not two weeks like previous years

114
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,060
the first thing that I want to share is

115
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:09,270
that I think a day before the launch of

116
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,070
the CTF which means to be somewhere on

117
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:13,260
the night between Friday and Saturday a

118
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,539
tommy'll site and a couple of other

119
00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:17,669
people decided that we want to make a

120
00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:19,770
last-minute challenge and they did

121
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,260
something hilarious which was a a an

122
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:25,740
interpreter based on emojis so in order

123
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,970
to solve the challenge you had to

124
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,650
understand how the code was written how

125
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:31,169
it was translated into emojis and to

126
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:33,360
solve the challenge itself providing an

127
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,760
online interpreter to try out your code

128
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:40,440
they finished that challenge at 5:30

129
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,960
a.m. on Saturday morning and we launched

130
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,370
on Sunday for those who are not reading

131
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,010
Hebrew I will try to translate some of

132
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:52,110
the notes and messages that we received

133
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:55,039
throughout the CTF some of them are from

134
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,010
very busy people who were somewhat fazed

135
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:01,560
by the hardness of the challenges and

136
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,510
offering their opinions about everyone's

137
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:08,669
personal hygiene Parenthood and other

138
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:12,810
issues their health has come up several

139
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:16,020
times in these messages or lack of

140
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:19,500
health from what left from trying these

141
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,659
challenges 48 hours straight

142
00:06:21,659 --> 00:06:25,169
and also we got a lot of interesting

143
00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:29,130
submissions of flags such as do you have

144
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:32,880
a heart or I cannot get / where people

145
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,010
really you could see the desperation in

146
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:37,380
their attempts trying any kind of length

147
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,260
flag to make it work I think that this

148
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,639
was the most amusing one

149
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,409
that you need to enable JavaScript

150
00:06:43,409 --> 00:06:45,719
around this app was used as a flag in

151
00:06:45,719 --> 00:06:47,909
one of our challenges obviously it was

152
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:52,379
incorrect another amusing thing at least

153
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:54,419
in my opinion was that we were reached

154
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:56,789
out because one of the overly sized

155
00:06:56,789 --> 00:06:59,580
challenges that it's a bit unfair that

156
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,080
you can't really do those challenges

157
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,110
over a mobile connection and when we try

158
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,969
to understand why well it's because it's

159
00:07:05,969 --> 00:07:08,699
over 5g the byte in size and my opinion

160
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:10,439
here is not that five gigabyte is a bit

161
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:13,139
much but who does a CTF over a mobile

162
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:15,509
connection that sounds absolutely insane

163
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:18,419
to me more than that

164
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:22,560
some people were misled by our false

165
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,159
flags and false breadcrumbs along the

166
00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:28,199
way and they found themselves spending

167
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,180
hours solving the wrong thing well they

168
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,889
already had the correct solution when

169
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:36,020
they started out again quality trolling

170
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,339
one of the challenges one of the more

171
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:39,689
interesting challenge was actually based

172
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:42,449
on a sort of zero day the emoji

173
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:45,300
challenge which I mentioned earlier had

174
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,330
an issue with the socket and once the

175
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:50,460
CTF was over Tomer were one of the

176
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,169
designers of the challenge actually

177
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:54,779
submitted the pull request to fix that

178
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:58,710
issue where he also found that beer

179
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:59,370
actually

180
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,409
is the solution to everything because it

181
00:08:01,409 --> 00:08:04,729
makes the exception handling misfire

182
00:08:04,729 --> 00:08:08,430
another thing was that we were got a lot

183
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,409
of compliments like there's a special

184
00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:12,089
place in hell for the person that made

185
00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:16,229
the target that's probably true and the

186
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:20,210
rs3 bucket also thinks the same person

187
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:23,879
also we actually had someone that was

188
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:26,909
able to solve Kjellberg past past the

189
00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:29,490
CTF deadline and that's pretty amazing

190
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:31,949
and everybody thought that was a really

191
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:35,279
good experience in jailbreak you had to

192
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,159
free a Groucho Marx out of prison the

193
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,419
interesting thing about that challenge

194
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,729
it was it based on based on a unknown

195
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:44,610
known for nobility that is if you

196
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:46,680
actually read the documentation for AWS

197
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,279
Cognito

198
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,470
you would know that these kind of

199
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,120
shenanigans were possible obviously

200
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,100
nobody really nobody really reads the

201
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,959
documentation therefore they didn't know

202
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:55,500
that such

203
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,810
bypass was possible so in the modes

204
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:00,510
levees challenge you had to break route

205
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,880
remarks out of prison by using a

206
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,930
vulnerability in AWS kognito we had

207
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,760
amazing graphics this year also an

208
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,530
upgrade for previous years I would like

209
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,270
to thank Vela for providing us with his

210
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:15,330
wonderful graphics and also a funny

211
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:18,690
story one of the CTF members had a dream

212
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:22,560
at the end of the CTF people came to his

213
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,700
and the other people who wrote that

214
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,520
challenge and burned down the houses and

215
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,500
then the guy that burned down their

216
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,300
houses was sent to prison he yelled at

217
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,910
them at the camera and says hahaha now I

218
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:35,460
will be broken out of prison cloud cloud

219
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:38,280
they tell me and scene so we thought

220
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,170
that was pretty funny thing to share and

221
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:42,060
then someone I will not name names

222
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,500
actually went ahead and created a nice

223
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,590
clip based on the very famous Hitler

224
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,980
losing his bananas about the city of

225
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,380
challenge and how unsolvable it is again

226
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,200
that was pretty funny so I would like to

227
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,120
first and foremost before anything else

228
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,550
thank the CTF team so a lot of good

229
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,560
people helped and worked on these 20

230
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,180
challenges we actually had more in the

231
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,120
pipeline but we didn't use them and that

232
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,550
is La Vie new mode Ezra

233
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:15,240

so thank all of you clapping please so

237
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,330
just to skim through a couple of the

238
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,280
people who wrote the challenges so we

239
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,710
had any more than Otto on jailbreak we

240
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:34,350
had an important Tommy on vampires and

241
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:37,140

244
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,710
proxy nightmare

245
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,660
we had Tommy on bases 32 and docker

246
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:49,080
manager Tommy and Danielle on buglar a

247

tamil and villa on certified app and

248
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,650
Vera and Yvonne back to the 90s a small

249
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,630
note this was a very funny snake game

250
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,160
that you had to disassemble the web

251
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,510
assembly behind it to solve the

252
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,880
challenge very funny

253
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,510
we had a guy writing capella myself

254
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:09,360
doing crypto stream for en la vie doing

255
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,399
ego hostel more with less check yourself

256
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:12,750
so you won't wreck yourself

257
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,870
and the target and finally my me file

258
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:18,810
with snap a stand snake face - and with

259
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:20,820
that I'd like to go ahead and announce

260
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:24,420
our winners stand by we are waiting for

261
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,300
the first place people are rushing for

262
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,620
the trophy

263
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,740
first and foremost 33rd place Houston we

264
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,990
got pond with two hundred and nine

265
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:37,589
twenty nine hundred points so I asked

266
00:11:37,589 --> 00:11:39,180
all of the team to send us some pictures

267
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:43,230
of them doing the challenges and doing

268
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:45,240
sharing some funny things that happened

269
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,010
while they were doing the challenges and

270
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,149
they told us that they had a lot of

271
00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:52,950
mishaps and all of things that they

272
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,930
missed and in their internal whatsapp

273
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:56,399
groups while they were solving this and

274
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,279
I think that's pretty speaks for itself

275
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,730
so I'll keep it moment on screen so you

276
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:06,570
can all see and observe their prize is

277
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,310
one hundred and fifty US dollars and

278
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,470
five hack the book vouchers for three

279
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:14,190
months and now second place we class a

280
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:17,399
forty one hundred and fifty points and I

281
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:19,800
asked them to share their images they

282
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,720
said it's a bit outdated but that's what

283
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,130
they use I will not disagree again they

284
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:28,890
had a lot of issues trying to solve

285
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:31,740
these challenges but they solved all of

286
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,690
the those challenges to actually get to

287
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:37,529
40 50 points they get three hundred

288
00:12:37,529 --> 00:12:39,690
dollars and five had half the box

289
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,959
voucher is valid for six months and

290
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:47,880
finally our winners everybody can see

291
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,610
our outrageously exaggerated trophy and

292
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:53,520
when I envision that trophy originally

293
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,440
my only requirement was that it would be

294
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,779
so large and ludicrous that when people

295
00:12:57,779 --> 00:12:59,760
send me images pictures from their

296
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,440
cubicle with that standing it will

297
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,510
actually overshadow their cubicle

298
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,670
however this year that probably won't

299
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,649
happen so I want to see this is a

300
00:13:07,649 --> 00:13:11,190
traveling trophy in everybody's homes so

301
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,910
we can see who actually put it where so

302
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:17,670
the JTTF team winners of the first place

303
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:21,209
with 4,500 points

304
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:24,420
and the city a CTF team actually worked

305
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,939
very very hard very diligently both on

306
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:30,869
the challenge in themselves as well as

307
00:13:30,869 --> 00:13:33,629
doing information campaigns against CTF

308
00:13:33,629 --> 00:13:37,829
writers somewhat unsuccessfully but much

309
00:13:37,829 --> 00:13:42,240
trolling ensued buglar caused a lot of

310
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,459
desperation among the teams and that was

311
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:47,040
actually pretty funny to watch and their

312
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,839
prize is four hundred and fifty US

313
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:51,149
dollars and five hectare box vouchers

314
00:13:51,149 --> 00:13:54,540
valid for 12 months and with that I want

315
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,160
to thank everyone who was involved with

316
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,230
making this a great city of event our

317
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:00,629
CTF sponsor is hacked box our CTF

318
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:03,779
writing team the infrastructure people

319
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:05,339
behind the backs actually making this

320
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:07,499
happen and scale from the expected

321
00:14:07,499 --> 00:14:10,980
amount of 300 users to almost 1500 users

322
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,220
and Amazon for providing us with so much

323
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,740
bandwidth for so much money so thank you

324
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:20,809
everyone and keep it up
