conference for getting designated to

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,359
ethical hacking that's taking place in

12

chicago

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,519

27
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,520

28
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,479
beautiful city

29
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,080

right

32
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,280
uh so my name is robert wagner i'm mr

33
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,400
minion on the twitters

34
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,000
i don't tweet a whole lot but it's a

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,759
great place to get a hold of me if you

36
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:26,880
like

37
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,400
and just a quick little introduction so

38
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,680
i need to make that active again so

39
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,640
uh i've got about 20 years of experience

40
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,920
in it

41
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,960
and infosec i started off my uh security

42
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,600
career

43
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,159
as a third shift sock analyst uh where

44
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:44,960
we were

45
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,159
running a 24x7 sock with four people

46
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,560
and one floater so i learned a heck of a

47
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,479
lot it was a great experience

48
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,560
but it was definitely a hectic time uh

49
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,079
moved my way up through security

50
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,360
engineer and architect

51
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,200
uh like karen said i'm a co-founder of

52
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,200
hack for kids where we teach kids about

53
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,920
internet safety security and ethics uh

54
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,680
and a co-organizer of verbsec and

55
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,280
burbsecond in chicago

56
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,560
we'll talk about what that is in a

57
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,120
minute uh my opinions in this deck

58
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,360
are my own or those of other researchers

59
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,760
and not necessarily those of my company

60
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,120
although they'd be really silly if they

61
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,720
disagreed with me because it should be

62
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,040
really great information

63
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,280
and of course my biggest claim to fame

64
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,440
uh is the dog i wrote uh taught to ride

65
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,560
motorcycle with me

66
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,280
uh this is rocket and uh he's fantastic

67
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,400
dog

68
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,599
uh so on to the presentations so uh i

69
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,080
i have been putting this together this

70
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,599
deck it's been a living deck for many

71
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,120
many years now

72
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,080
um and uh and i put it together because

73
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,400
i

74
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,800
saw that too many companies kept getting

75
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,800
fixated on buying technologies to fix

76
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,920
their problem right

77
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,599
buy this new technology by that

78
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,680
technology and when uh

79
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,080
when i was in the sock um oh and it

80
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,920
results in shiny object syndrome so when

81
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,120
i was in the stock the

82
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,519
we had a problem it's the same problem

83
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:00,400
every company has

84
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,680
there was never enough budget to

85
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,840
actually buy all these shiny things

86
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,599
right or to even get new head count and

87
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,879
things like that

88
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,280
even training uh sometimes there wasn't

89
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,560
enough budget to get everybody

90
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,920
the training they wanted so i started

91
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,360
noticing that i needed

92
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,159
to find out free easy or cheap ways to

93
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,519
fill our security gaps

94
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,040
so every time i was at a conference and

95
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,640
i heard somebody say well if they had

96
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,519
just done this

97
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,440
or this is easy to mitigate you just do

98
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,560
that and it was

99
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,879
it was a free or easy mitigation i would

100
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,080
write that down and i

101
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,720
just kept that all together and put this

102
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,159
into this deck

103
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,319
especially because a lot of times if you

104
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,000
missed that presentation and didn't get

105
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,599
to hear that easy mitigation

106
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,760
you might never actually hear about it

107
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,440
uh but over and over again

108
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,400
i saw that the best place to start every

109
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,000
high-performing security group that i

110
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,480
saw

111
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,239
started with the most important security

112
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,080
tool in their organization it's the one

113
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,200
everybody's got

114
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,920
and and which what tool is that yeah

115
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,560
it's you

116
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,239
now that's not to call you guys tools

117
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,319
that's not my intended all um

118
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,159
but every company that i saw that

119
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,080
focused on the people first

120
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,640
did so much better i saw a small

121
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,840
security team of

122
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,040
five outperform a larger security team

123
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,080
of 25

124
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,239
because the larger team focused on just

125
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,160
technology they always wanted the shiny

126
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,959
object right

127
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,279
whereas the smaller team challenged each

128
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,720
other they taught each other how to

129
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,160
script they taught each other how to

130
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,639
hack

131
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,199
um and they did a fabulous fabulous job

132
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,040
with just five people

133
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,040
um so the problem of course that we're

134
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,240
describing here is this

135
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,240
stupid venn diagram right who hates this

136
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,000
venn diagram i hate it

137
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,320
because every place i go we see people

138
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,320
focusing always on the technology buying

139
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,360
more technology

140
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,919
and what happens if you disregard if you

141
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:42,479
ignore

142
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,720
your people in process you get something

143
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,000
that looks like this

144
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,639
and nobody wants this for their security

145
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,000
uh group right this is not the

146
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,120
description we want

147
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,680
for our security team not at all so how

148
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,479
do we do that

149
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,160
now i don't think i have to tell most of

150
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,560
the people at b-sides tel aviv

151
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,039
that there's fantastic information to be

152
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:01,680
found

153
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,560
at hacker cons but managers if you're

154
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,280
listening

155
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,759
and please dear god be listening this is

156
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:08,560
a great

157
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,840
place to be sending your people um i

158
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,120
i've learned so much

159
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,479
and you'll see much what i've learned

160
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,280
from my mentors from mike poor ed scotus

161
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,440
mubics dave kennedy danny harris-benten

162
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,520
ryan cover dave harold and more

163
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,600
um and you can see most of the

164
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,560
conferences

165
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,680
online defcon shmukhan tour khan most of

166
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,000
the b-sides including besides tel aviv

167
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,120
uh broadcast and record their uh their

168
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,080
uh

169
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,919
sessions now especially now with govan

170
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,199
19. um

171
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,759
and they're free or very cheap hacker

172
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:40,400
cons

173
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,880
are typically very cheap they're free

174
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,120
and i'm seeing csos and security

175
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,320
managers going at them

176
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,840
the problem we had of course when when i

177
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,520
was in the sock was well

178
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,120
three people could go to really

179
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,720
extensive training this year

180
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,320
and three people could go next year when

181
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,240
we had more budget for the price of just

182
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,680
one of those classes

183
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,840
you could send your entire staff to a

184
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,680
good event like besides tel aviv

185
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,440
and if you're not if you managers are

186
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,199
not you're pissing your money away

187
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:05,840
because

188
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,680
this is great places for them to go

189
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,759
learn make sure that they go do

190
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,440
everything you can to get your people

191
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,240
to these kinds of events in addition

192
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:14,800
there are

193
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,400
great researchers sharing out in their

194
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,639
blogs so infosec taylor swift

195
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,639
hopefully most people have heard of them

196
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,199
uh the decent security blog there

197
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,000
is fantastic teaches you how to secure

198
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,160
your windows and how to log your windows

199
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,440
to look for evil

200
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,600
hacks for pancakes another fantastic

201
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,440
surger a researcher who

202
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,319
shares prolifically online um her blog

203
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,520
to syffini.net

204
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,560
has great dfir information and then

205
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,680
there's uh the concept of uh of city sac

206
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,800
um it started about the mid-2000s

207
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,960
where rather than having formal meetups

208
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,720
like issa and isaka

209
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,800
which are good organizations too how

210
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,560
about just an informal meetup

211
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,880
where people get together uh have some

212
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,000
beers uh

213
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,280
be very social but informal uh so

214
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,840
burbsec

215
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,840
because it started up in the suburbs of

216
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,440
chicago uh there's

217
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,840
five of those now uh every month in

218
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,639
chicago

219
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,680
and for the price of a beer i learn

220
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,360
what my red teaming friends and pen

221
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,919
testing friends um are doing and by the

222
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,280
way they're freaking bored

223
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,360
they're getting into organizations the

224
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,319
same way

225
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,639
every single time and i guarantee you if

226
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,000
that's how they're getting into

227
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,440
organizations on paid

228
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,280
engagement that's how the bad guys are

229
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,039
getting into your organization

230
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,440
so if you're a blue teamer sit with

231
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,039
those red team people

232
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,120
listen to their stories understand how

233
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,039
they're working their attacks if you

234
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,479
don't have the advantage of having

235
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,000
your own red team at your organization

236
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,240
to do purple team exercises learn from

237
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,120
those people

238
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,479
it's a great way to go if you're going

239
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:47,919
to set one up in your own city if you

240
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,360
don't have one going on

241
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,599
the formula is simple get three people

242
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,120
from three different organizations

243
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,919
preferably

244
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,599
because if any one of those

245
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,280
organizations is having a real security

246
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,800
incident you've got two other people

247
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,360
that can show up meet at the same same

248
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,720
day of the month like the first thursday

249
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,840
of the month whatever

250
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,720
at the same place um and the organizers

251
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,919
jobs are just to

252
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,400
show up make people feel welcome when

253
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,599
new people show up say

254
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,840
hey new person welcome come on this is

255
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,120
the group come on have a

256
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,840
have a drink uh join us um and then make

257
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,280
sure that the bar of course knows

258
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,599
that remembers that you're coming um and

259
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,520
just make it a welcoming place

260
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,319
and uh our we've grown to five here in

261
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,639
chicago and it's a fantastic method

262
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,720
um so that's how we level up our people

263
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,320
but how do we level up our users

264
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,440
themselves right

265
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,599
those uh those videos the security

266
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:36,559
awareness videos

267
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,799
they're so awful you want to rub glass

268
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,000
in your eyes right they're

269
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,760
terrible we have to do them anyway

270
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,279
because it's a compliance issue

271
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,720
but how about doing something that

272
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,360
really teaches our users about security

273
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,800
and gets them excited about it

274
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,800
so i got this idea from ben 10 you can

275
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,480
actually see this whole video from

276
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,480
derbycon like 2013 2014 just google it

277
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,279
but it's a great idea he gamified

278
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,519
security awareness in his organization

279
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,480
and it was simple all he did was say hey

280
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,000
everybody in my organization

281
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,519
um you're going to start seeing some

282
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,680
security related issues like you might

283
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,279
have seen in that security awareness

284
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,080
training you had

285
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,920
the first person that reports any single

286
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,920
one of those uh security issues

287
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,760
will get a gift certificate to dunkin

288
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,519
donuts or whatever your local coffee

289
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,320
shop is

290
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,800
um at the end of the month a week

291
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,959
whoever gets the most will get a gift

292
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:25,920
card for

293
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,399
i don't know hundred two hundred dollars

294
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,160
nothing too expensive

295
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,360
within a couple of days people were

296
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,560
trash talking

297
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,399
other people at the water quality like

298
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,560
you're going down i'm totally reporting

299
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,519
more than you are

300
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,279
people started reporting things like

301
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,040
there was a strange box on

302
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,200
outside the side door uh it turned out

303
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,959
to be just one of those rodent control

304
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:47,680
devices

305
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,600
but still people were paying attention

306
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,760
um somebody else reported the cfo

307
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,920
for not having their badge on uh as they

308
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,040
were going through the halls which was

309
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,320
against policy which is

310
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,200
great and the best one actually happened

311
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,080
about

312
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,279
uh 15 minutes into the contest he gets a

313
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,800
call from a very excited woman she's

314
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,120
like

315
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,519
hey hey i see one of your things and

316
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,399

319
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,399
and he's like um wow we haven't started

320
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:17,120

321
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,040
what is it you're seeing and she's like

322
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,800
oh this pop-up comes up every once in a

323
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,720
while and says uh you know click here to

324
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,000

325
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,880
what it i just click it and once he took

326
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,200
his face out of his palm he said

327
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,519
uh yeah how long has that been happening

328
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,079
for he said oh like six months now

329
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,480
yeah he had a real security incident 15

330
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,279
minutes in

331
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,640
uh he had turned his people into

332
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,640
carbon-based intrusion detection systems

333
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,800
and it was beautiful now i will give you

334
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,920
one word of caution

335
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,519
so as i've talked to people you know

336
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,959
around the country around the us at

337
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:47,920
least and uh

338
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,959
and and they've said yeah we did that um

339
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,040
and it worked great one place told me it

340
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,959
worked great for a while

341
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,800
and then we ran into a problem we had

342
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,680
some users that were so overzealous

343
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,760
that they started doing things like

344
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,880
downloading nessus

345
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,640
to scan for vulnerability so that they

346
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,240
could report that now

347
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,839
if your users can download and run

348
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,160
nessus you also have other problems

349
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,720
that you need to address but there are

350
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,240
some users who may get a little

351
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,120
overzealous

352
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,640
uh so just be careful about this idea um

353
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,200
so emmett yes um for those who don't

354
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:21,760
know it

355
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,240
uh do not just turn it on it will break

356
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,760
 all over your organization

357
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,160
but it can be helpful um it's designed

358
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,760
it's it's free from microsoft

359
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,000
it's designed to protect the apps uh uh

360
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,760
a memory of apps you designate

361
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,519
um you gotta test the heck out of it

362
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,279
there are bypasses for it like rock

363
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,320
chaining and yes it end of life in 2018

364
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,279
um that's if everything all your windows

365
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:43,680
at least

366
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,519
is on wind 10 by now and can you

367
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,519
honestly say that it is

368
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,560
what does every atm in north america

369
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,600
still run on to this day yeah it's

370
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,360
windows xp i mean it's embedded windows

371
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,880
xp but my point is is that

372
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,240
there's always going to be pockets of

373
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,200
stuff that may be able to leverage this

374
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,160
um and i i you know i i wonder uh

375
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,839
somebody told me that it may even be

376
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,360
built into the next version of

377
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,600
defender and i know dana spoke earlier

378
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,440
i'd love to hear if that's actually part

379
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,240
of the tool

380
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,200
uh as of now um but it reduces the

381
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,800
number of tools an attacker can use and

382
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,320
you've made it harder for an attacker to

383
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,839
win

384
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,360
ah so why are passwords still the bane

385
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,839
of security practitioners blue teamers

386
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:26,959
existence right

387
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,440
this should be solved by now and they

388
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,120
the the best answer of course

389
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,680
is two factor right two factor cures a

390
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,600
lot of sins in fact if you were gonna

391
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,160
shiny object syndrome on something get

392
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,360
two-factor it's

393
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,200
it goes beyond shiny object it actually

394
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,560
works it does stuff

395
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,480
that's really helpful right solves a lot

396
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,399
of sins but not only does not one not

397
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,839
use the same password

398
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,760
for banking and twitter but how many of

399
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,519
you think you might have a domain admin

400
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,000
who who

401
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,920
went to the trouble to create a really

402
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,360
complex password like

403
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,399
18 characters long all random memorized

404
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:58,800
it

405
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,360
and then when they had to sign up for

406
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,040
their banking account or their

407
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,760
local home depot or whatever they also

408
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,240
use

409
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,800
the same password right yeah it's it's

410
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,680
not great

411
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,000
um in fact it's so bad the password

412
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
situation who here's seen this xkcd

413
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,800
cartoon by now

414
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,800
hopefully most of you have if you hadn't

415
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,720
um that the point is is this

416
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,800
this that we've been teaching right here

417
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,720
for for 20 years now

418
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,200
teaching people to uh you know use leap

419
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:25,839
speak and

420
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,160
replace letters without this is absolute

421
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,920
crap this cartoon is about

422
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,959
nine years old now and nine years ago

423
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,279
it took three days for a password

424
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,720
cracking rig to crack the hash on

425
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,000
something like this

426
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,600
and people that are running more modern

427
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,639
ones using gpus they're telling me

428
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,279
an hour maybe minutes this is this is

429
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,240
terrible this is

430
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,240
bad we've got to get rid of this get two

431
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,000
factor when you can but it's not free

432
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,279
it's not cheap right

433
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,440
so until then what can we do well

434
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,720
password phrases

435
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,959
heck of a lot better so nine years ago

436
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,399
it took something like

437
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,120
550 years to pass correct horse battery

438
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,000
staple

439
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,480
uh to do don't obviously use that one

440
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,000
it's in every dictionary now

441
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,480
but uh password cracking dictionary but

442
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,079
add a

443
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,800
even now a password cracking rig a few

444
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,920
hours maybe a day

445
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,680
but you throw in an extra number you

446
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,360
throw in an extra special character

447
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,199
and the entropy on this still goes way

448
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,040
up and last but not least especially for

449
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,800
like your domain admins

450
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,199
keepass is free there are other password

451
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,079
vaults that are

452
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,079
free that they could be leveraging now

453
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,600
some of my red team friends go

454
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,360
yeah but if you have a password vault

455
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,040
and i fish my way on your system then i

456
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,560
have your whole list of passwords

457
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,560
to which i say yeah but if you have one

458
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,160
password and it's on a sticky note under

459
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:38,880
your keyboard

460
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,320
and i sneak in the back door with the

461
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,639
smokers i still have all your passwords

462
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,639
so a password vault is it's at least

463
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:45,839
some mitigation

464
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,320
um password phrases some mitigation get

465
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,920
the two-factor as soon as you can

466
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,959
authy is free but i haven't heard

467
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,800
anybody implementing authy

468
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,040
it's a it's a free two-factor um open

469
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,639
source tool uh

470
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,079
through an enterprise like through an

471
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,920
entire large organization so

472
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,279
your mileage may vary on that one

473
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,120
smaller organizations you may be able to

474
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,639
leverage it pretty quickly

475
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,399
um so java so who here

476
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,440
still has java 6 somewhere in your

477
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,320
organization

478
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,399
now i can't see your hands but some of

479
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,079
you are laughing right now i know

480
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,079
some of you may not realize it but i

481
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,560
guarantee you you have java 6

482
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,720
somewhere in your organization and the

483
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,680
reason is

484
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,480
always always the same there is some

485
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,839
mission critical app

486
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,000
it's like what the whole company depends

487
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,920
on it runs in the back office

488
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,959
the developer died like 10 years ago

489
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,959
and no one knows how to update it no one

490
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,160
knows how to fix it

491
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,839
so here you are stuck with this old

492
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,079
version of java which needs old java

493
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:45,199
agents

494
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,399
um java 6 to connect to it now the great

495
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:48,959
thing is

496
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,600
is you don't have to let java connect to

497
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,880
the internet right

498
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,800
that's where the problem lies is when

499
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,399
that old version of java connects the

500
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:56,880
internet

501
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,680
that's when you get owned well every uh

502
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,959
instance of java

503
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,959
installs with a its own user agent

504
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,639
string and you can actually

505
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,959
block that user agent string at the

506
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,079
outbound proxy

507
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,399
so by blocking that um you don't let it

508
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,279
out to the internet

509
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,959
laptops are a problem of course because

510
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,320
they leave the network

511
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,639
um you're going to have to do i mean you

512
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,160
could mitigate it by

513
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,639
backhauling everybody through the vpn

514
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,000
that would be a freaking nightmare

515
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,320
but it is a mitigation um probably a

516
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,360
better one would be

517
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,839
a gpo that says when the system's off

518
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,040
the corporate network

519
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,279
uh java doesn't run at all just shut

520
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:32,240
that down

521
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,680
um so uh so block those old versions

522
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,880
don't let java go outside and get rid of

523
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,600
it eventually

524
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,199
you got it you got to get someone in to

525
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:42,720
fix that old app

526
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,040
uh so this is great so um this is from

527
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,199
blueteamer.blogspot.com

528
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,079
this is every extension that is

529
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,000
executable that you should be blocking

530
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,240
at the email gateway now can uh an

531
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,320
attacker obfuscate the extension and get

532
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:56,720
into

533
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,920
some other way absolutely but still

534
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,759
block all of these it will get rid of

535
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,040
some low-hanging fruit and i mean the

536
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,280
whole list put the whole list in

537
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,839
block it all just do it be like nike

538
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,559
please

539
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:09,599
now i know what you're saying you're

540
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,359
saying robert yeah but there might be

541
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,039
some people in my organization that need

542
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:13,520
their

543
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,160
ceo and i don't know what to do yeah it

544
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:16,880
doesn't matter

545
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,880
if apple can tell us that we can live

546
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,240
without a headset check and we're just

547
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,359
gonna have to deal with it

548
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,359
you can tell your users all this is

549
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,959
getting shut down now

550
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,280
have a really robust exception policy in

551
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,319
place and i mean

552
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,000
you need to be able to act on it fast

553
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,840
there will be a few people that have a

554
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,280
legit need for

555
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,280
one or more of these extensions and you

556
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,440
can make exceptions for that tiny

557
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,200
group of people but for the rest of

558
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,039
everybody else just get rid of this

559
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,160
it needs to go away um and

560
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,760
and it's free and it's cheap and it

561
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,440
actually works it does stuff

562
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,960
um so antivirus um you've got it anyway

563
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,440
right

564
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,960
it's yeah of limited value right

565
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,039
but it's not completely useless so one

566
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,120
nice thing about every major antivirus

567
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,440
is that can be used to search for iocs

568
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,200
now you could also use your phone

569
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:03,760
scanner

570
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,440
if your phone scanner is authenticating

571
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,039
to everything and it needs to

572
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,000
authenticate to

573
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,760
every device out there to use it in that

574
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,480
fashion not everybody does that

575
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,039
so av is out there on everything though

576
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,640
again usually because of compliance

577
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,280
reasons

578
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,600
so if you if you take that list right of

579
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,640
things that are coming through and you

580
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,280
dump that

581
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,799
into cuckoo or something and extract

582
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,640
your indicators of compromise dump it in

583
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,360
your av

584
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,520
your av is now helping you uh in

585
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,679
addition heuristics

586
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,080
still finds some malicious code right

587
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,200
heuristics was this

588
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,120
one of his attempts at uh doing things

589
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,200
without it being signature based right

590
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,039
uh to to actually analyze

591
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,880
uh what's going on and figure out that

592
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,640
it's malicious uh

593
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,679
by a heuristic check it's pretty noisy

594
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,600
it can be pretty noisy so i imagine

595
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,760
that's why people have disabled it in

596
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,200
some organizations

597
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,679
have your it teams do the work to tweak

598
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,679
it get it up and running it will catch

599
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,120
some low-hanging fruit

600
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,360
and last but not least is anybody just

601
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,280
checking the av alerts it's it's free

602
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,240
and cheap to do

603
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,200
but i have so many times seen attackers

604
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,559
go through an organization

605
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,400
they're tripping off av left and right

606
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,919
but it doesn't matter because nobody's

607
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:11,600
looking and by the time they get domain

608
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,240
admin

609
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,679
you know this game over too late um

610
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,480
so i love this next section this whole

611
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,120
section is

612
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,080
some people call it honey tokens um

613
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,280
canaries landmines um whatever tripwires

614
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,720
not the product chip wire just a

615
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,880
tripwire uh in concept

616
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,440
and it's great it's the whole process of

617
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,960
tricking the attacker into doing

618
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,679
something

619
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,039
that lets you know that they're there

620
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,559
without them knowing that you know that

621
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:37,919
they're there or maybe they even know

622
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,280
that you know that they're there but by

623
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,640
that time it's too late so

624
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,640
in any event one of the easiest ones is

625
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,919
something like a honey file

626
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,400
you get together with your it team you

627
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,000
put a hidden file

628
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,240
in the golden image it goes out to all

629
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,600
your systems if you want to get really

630
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,160
tricky

631
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,679
you can even use a little bit of

632
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,200
scripting a little bit of regex

633
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,600
to make the pass through the file name

634
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,280
different on every system that it goes

635
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,480
on just a little bit different

636
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,640
a little bit different size but you call

637
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,159
it something juicy

638
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,960
credit cards password list something

639
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,880
that an attacker just wouldn't be able

640
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,919
to resist

641
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,240
and then alert on access to that one

642
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:12,960
file

643
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,880
you can monitor your entire uh user base

644
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,360
just with this right very simple very

645
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,000
easy way

646
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,440
you don't have to log the world you

647
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,200
don't have to monitor the world just

648
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,400
this one simple thing

649
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,159
to get you started free easy works great

650
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,320
prone to some false positives right if

651
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,080
someone drops down to the command prompt

652
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,600
and does a dirt slash s

653
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,120
you are going to get a false positive on

654
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,679
this i don't see users doing that

655
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,080
a whole lot anymore right um make sure

656
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,120
you uh

657
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,360
don't uh you know whitelist it out from

658
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,880
your things like

659
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,799
your av scanners and stuff like that so

660
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,320
that they don't touch the file

661
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,640
but just this one simple thing can catch

662
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,600
so much evil

663
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,440
you want a little bit better fidelity

664
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,960
let's do something even trickier

665
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,080
let's create a fake domain admin account

666
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,240
you call it domain admin whatever

667
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,400
put the password actually in the

668
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,840
description of this account

669
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,440
literally say and the password is

670
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,120
the attacker will think you are the

671
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,640
dumbest window admin

672
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,320
that must have ever existed right

673
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,360
they're going to see that when they're

674
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,039
enumerating active directory

675
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,840
they're gonna go i have you now and uh

676
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,200
all they're really gonna get

677
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,039
is uh is nothing right there you put

678
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,480
this in the admins group you make it log

679
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,360
on hour zero

680
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,840
it can't actually be used but then again

681
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,880
you alert

682
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,440
if the actual uh account is used in

683
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,640
active directory

684
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,159
and now you've caught someone creeping

685
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,240
through your networks right trying to

686
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,679
gain access with this fake account um

687
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,960
so some even some more landmines so um

688
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,000
who here is is anybody actually a dva

689
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,080
um i i hope not if you are put your

690
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,600
fingers in yours because they are such

691
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,880
prima donnas right

692
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,679
we can't put anything on their databases

693
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,440
to monitor for security

694
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,760
so instead of putting something on let's

695
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,000
collude with the dbas and be clever

696
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,159
let's make a honey database or a honey

697
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,760
table

698
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,919
don't publish a schema only have a few

699
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,600
people that even know about it

700
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,480
hide it somewhere and then alert just on

701
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,440
simple access

702
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,280
of this table or this database call it

703
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,559
something juicy again

704
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,400
call it credit cards call it something

705
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,000
someone will want to steal from your

706
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,039
organization

707
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,000
and alert simply on access to that table

708
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,039
or database

709
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,240
it works beautifully and and it's not

710
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,480
prone to false positives if you do get

711
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,280
one

712
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,960
obviously your dba needs to go back to

713
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,400
remedial dba school

714
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,760
because they just did something like

715
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,240
select star from everything right

716
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,200
uh so great way to just monitor people

717
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,799
trying to access your data

718
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,039
and then this last one so this is great

719
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,039
so you can download this from github

720
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,080
it's called invoke run as uh all it does

721
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,919
is you deploy it with sccm or whatever

722
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,840
to all your windows machines it loads a

723
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,400
fake

724
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,919
admin account and a fake set of

725
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,640
credentials into memory um and then

726
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,120
again

727
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,880
just like the other one you alert on use

728
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,880
but this is great so this is going to

729
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,840
catch people

730
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,400
trying to scrape creds from memory

731
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,760
something like nemicats or something

732
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,480
like that

733
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,559
it's not likely to hit a false positive

734
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,640
because your users shouldn't be able to

735
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,960
do something like that if they are again

736
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,280
you have bigger problems um but a great

737
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,320
way to catch

738
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,320
a potentially more advanced attacker

739
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,840
within your organization or at least an

740
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,280
attacker that knows how to run the right

741
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:19,760
tools

742
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,280
and scrape creds and then just recently

743
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,320
i ran into this one

744
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,120
um the concept of honey people um even a

745
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,320
honey org

746
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,799
uh but basically instead of taking those

747
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,000
uh those phishing

748
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,320
emails that usually go into the report

749
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,240
phishing email address

750
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,559
pass those phishing email on to a honey

751
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:39,280
person

752
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,760
who you've created an entire dossier for

753
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,200
they should have a linkedin account

754
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,880
social media all this stuff

755
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,080
and that honey person can then interact

756
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,240
with your fisher with your attacker and

757
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,760
get you more information

758
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,760
than you would have if you would just

759
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,679
run virustotal or something against the

760
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:56,480
link so

761
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,520
very clever idea i like this a lot um

762
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,400
and uh and starting to explore more and

763
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:02,720
in

764
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,640
scripting that and delivering a whole

765
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,320
honey org um

766
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,039
within an organization very clever idea

767
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:09,440
uh

768
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,960
other quick ways to stop attackers in

769
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,279
the tracks so using a web form

770
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:15,440
to authenticate to the proxy is a great

771
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,799
way to stop a

772
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,120
a lot of attacks i even heard it

773
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,720
suggested i think mubic said

774
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,720
uh that you can go so far as to ask

775
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,320
users to allow a site

776
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,000
once per day so the first person that

777
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,760
goes to google they get a little pop-up

778
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,360
and say is it okay to go to google and

779
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,080
they say yes

780
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,200
or no uh but um obviously you don't want

781
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,320
them saying no to google

782
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,559
uh the the idea really isn't that they

783
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,240
should know whether or not the site is

784
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,200
okay or not

785
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,600
it's just that automated stuff won't

786
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,520
know what to do with something like that

787
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,360
right so it's a little stopping block

788
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,880
for a script there's a a w-pad

789
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,559
vulnerability a man-in-the-middle uh

790
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:51,520
vulnerability

791
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,000
these two null routes take that volume

792
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,919
mitigate that vulnerability um so

793
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,760
just by deploying those two null routes

794
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,200
you can mitigate that uh

795
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,600
that wpad vulnerability in addition

796
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,400
i want you to get rid of that bios i

797
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,000
know you can't get rid of it

798
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,279
this week or this year even but

799
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,320
have it in your plan five year plan i

800
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,360
don't care what it is

801
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,799
get rid of net bios it just allows

802
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,000
so much evil there's the llm and our um

803
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,320
attacks that it allows for and if

804
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,240
anybody's heard of the tool responder

805
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,240
it's one of the first things most pen

806
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,240
testers and red teamers download

807
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,080
i'm sure it's most what most attackers

808
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,279
will download as well

809
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,919
and with netbios it will wait for

810
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,120
netbios broadcast

811
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,120
and then lie it'll say hi yeah that's

812
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,039
that's me i i'm the server you're

813
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,559
looking for go ahead give me your hash

814
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:43,760
give me your creds whatever

815
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,760
i'll take care of everything for you net

816
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,799
bios needs to be gotten rid of

817
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,840
so make a plan do it logically but get

818
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,200
rid of it

819
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,080
uh also disabling dns for internal

820
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:56,880
namespace

821
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,480
so again making it harder for your

822
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,159
attacker to get outside to get to their

823
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,159
tools to exfiltrate data

824
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,480
your internal name servers do not need

825
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,919
to do forward lookups

826
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,640
for outbound um ip addresses right

827
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,080
that's the proxy's job

828
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,000
let the proxy do it and if you're using

829
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
a web form to authenticate to the proxy

830
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,679
now you've doubled down you know you're

831
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,039
mitigating lots

832
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,600
more uh just by uh leveraging those two

833
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,279
together

834
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,720
um what roadblocks so lapse is free

835
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,240
it's free from windows or if it's not

836
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,000
free you can negotiate it in with your

837
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,200
contract anyway

838
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,279
make them give it to you for free it

839
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,279
does a good job

840
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,200
if you have local admin still within

841
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,200
your organization

842
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,360
uh and it's going to allow somebody you

843
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,720
know if it's the same

844
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,360
local admin uh and password on every

845
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,000
system

846
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,400
it's gonna allow an attacker to jump

847
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,760
from machine to machine to machine

848
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,120
lateral moving

849
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,200
laps takes care of that it randomizes

850
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,640
local admin password

851
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,400
there are some bypasses for it but for

852
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,400
the most part it works

853
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,640
really well now get rid of local admin

854
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,520
as soon as you can

855
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,480
but just like netbios i understand there

856
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:02,880
are

857
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,799
business reasons some of these things

858
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,799
hang around get rid of them

859
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:10,000
as you can make a plan and then the last

860
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,320
one

861
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,080
got this from dave kennedy this is great

862
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,679
so this is nothing more

863
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,799
than a simple gpo deny access to this

864
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:17,600
computer to

865
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,840
you to your workstations and laptops

866
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,120
from the network

867
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,600
um yeah i.t people still need to connect

868
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,320
to systems

869
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,039
but they're i.t they can flip that gpo

870
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:27,440
you

871
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,520
put this on and deny access and there's

872
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,559
no reason

873
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,559
anybody other than it should ever need

874
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,320
to connect to your users

875
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,760
systems so just block that you do this

876
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,600
and all of a sudden an attacker needs to

877
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,679
either hope for vulnerability that will

878
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,200
allow them to laterally move

879
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,240
or they need to start fishing each and

880
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:46,799
every

881
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,200
individual target in your organization

882
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,480
to get to their goal

883
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,840
you're going to make their lives

884
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,399
freaking miserable you do this

885
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,559
so what about the logs robert so some of

886
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:57,919
you know i work for splunk

887
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:59,919
so how about some uh tricky stuff with

888
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:01,200
logs doesn't mean you have to have

889
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,720
splunk to do this this is all stuff you

890
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,080
can do with whatever

891
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,279
um any logs uh so pass a hash yeah it's

892
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:08,960
on to the decline right now it's

893
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,840
typically not the go-to um but this uh

894
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,279
still pretty good fidelity

895
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,200
you could even run this against your

896
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,960
backlog of logs

897
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,760
see if pasta hash was in use before

898
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,840
especially maybe by an insider

899
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,279
is a great way to see if you haven't had

900
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:27,760
any insider threat problems in the past

901
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,039
and your mileage may vary but uh

902
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,410
it's worth a go on this one um

903
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:34,720
[Music]

904
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,440
so dns uh and dns logs are another

905
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,600
fantastic place to go looking for evil

906
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,960
it's very hard for attackers not to

907
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,600
leave their fingerprint on dns

908
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,080
um so you can look for unauthorized dns

909
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:46,880
and this is just

910
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,960
three different ways to do it um they

911
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,399
all get you the same results it just

912
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:51,039
depends on

913
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,399
what the source of your dns log is um

914
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,159
your dns spoofing activity similar

915
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,159
concept and then this uh this third one

916
00:28:58,159 --> 00:28:58,720
here

917
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,480
finding clients connecting to multiple

918
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,480
dns servers one of my peers came up with

919
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:02,960
this

920
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,559
and i thought it was brilliant because

921
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,200
by default how many dns servers does any

922
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,960
particular host know about

923
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,440
two right so if it's connecting to more

924
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,279
than two dns servers unless you've got

925
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,559
some sort of round-robin

926
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:17,679
going on and you can again mitigate that

927
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,880
um but uh you find host connecting to

928
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,320
multiple dns servers

929
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,159
that's pretty freaking weird you want to

930
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,880
go hunting that down

931
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,120
extremely long dns queries so this would

932
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,320
be used for

933
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,799
things like data exfiltration right so

934
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,000
quick and easy ways

935
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,720
to to look for extremely long you can do

936
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,720
over two standard deviations

937
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,200
this uh url toolkit by the way that's

938
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,720
another free tool from splunk you can

939
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,279
use this

940
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:44,640
but again you don't need to use splunk

941
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,320
to get to standard deviations you can do

942
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,679
your own math against it

943
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:50,159
um or 200 characters long now these

944
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:51,520
aren't magic numbers right they're a

945
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,480
place to start

946
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,720
you're gonna have to tweak up and down

947
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,600
based on

948
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,240
uh your environment to to get the right

949
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,279
amount of deviation it could be 2.1 2.4

950
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,760
maybe under whatever 200 characters long

951
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,399
maybe not

952
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,159
quite long enough maybe too long just

953
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:07,760
tweak it a bit and you should start

954
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,279
finding very suspicious

955
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,960
dns traffic if it's within your

956
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,360
organization um entropy is another great

957
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:13,840
way

958
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,200
to look for unusual dns so uh by

959
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,799
applying shannon entropy

960
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:21,520
um to something like google.com you get

961
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,279
an entropy score of 2.6

962
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,919
whereas this long string right here

963
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:27,760
that's going to get you an entropy score

964
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,799
of 4.28 which is really high uh in a

965
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:31,600
trivia math

966
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,600
that's it doesn't seem like a widespread

967
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,520
but that is a huge

968
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,760
difference in entropy between those two

969
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,760
things and then you just apply that to

970
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,960
your dns queries

971
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,559
and you can start pulling out some very

972
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,640
unusual stuff so domains with high

973
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,880
entropy subdomains with the entropy

974
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,279
you will have to filter out for cdns

975
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:50,159
right so

976
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,039
the alexa 1 million two minutes

977
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,000
something like that

978
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,039
filter out the alexa um

979
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:00,799
for cdns and what remains

980
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,399
depending on how you tweak that should

981
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,320
again be pretty evil so

982
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,360
uh to give you an example um things like

983
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,039
these long strings here you can see

984
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,840
everything ended up with a a score of

985
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,240
over

986
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,519
4.4 all of it really high entropy all of

987
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,360
it if it's not a cdn would be pretty

988
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,240
suspicious

989
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,679
and something your hunters might want to

990
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,840
track down ah

991
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,120
so algorithms right uh so ai and

992
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,399
algorithms it's all the hot

993
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,480
everybody wants to sell you some fancy

994
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,679
shiny ai

995
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,559
you can do it for free um so to get you

996
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:33,120
started

997
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,519
um you can download something like r or

998
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,840
scipy scientific uh

999
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,679
the python kit for scientific computing

1000
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:41,440
um you can even download some free tools

1001
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,240
from splunk

1002
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,200
uh it all works the same way um so what

1003
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:45,519
uh

1004
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:46,720
to give an example of how you can

1005
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,880
leverage it uh we downloaded an

1006
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,840
interesting data set

1007
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,799
so in the us um uh the government um

1008
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,000
healthcare is called medicare and

1009
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,720
medicaid

1010
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,120
and you can go here to the research tab

1011
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,240
and download

1012
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,039
tons of data so we downloaded a year's

1013
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,880
worth of prescriptions

1014
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,480
uh you don't of course hipaa and

1015
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,279
everything you don't know who the

1016
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:06,320
prescription was

1017
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,200
for but you get everything else what it

1018
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:09,760
was for

1019
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,200
who wrote it when they wrote it where

1020
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,279
they wrote it all that great stuff

1021
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,600
um we said let's go see what we can just

1022
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,960
mine out of this data

1023
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,840
so we reduced it down to just the opioid

1024
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,240
uh

1025
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,919
prescriptions right figuring there might

1026
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:23,600
be something that we could find that

1027
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,440
would be interesting there

1028
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,360
and this is all we did so we ran it

1029
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,720
through two

1030
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,880
algorithms the first algorithm is called

1031
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,840
pca

1032
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,240
and pca basically is an algorithm to

1033
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,000
take a huge data set

1034
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,279
and reduce it down to x number of data

1035
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,120
points so we chose three and you can see

1036
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,640
the results that pc

1037
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,799
one two and three right there um those

1038
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:47,039
are whatever the algorithm figured out

1039
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,720
is the most relevant things

1040
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,039
about this data set and then we ran it

1041
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,799
through just one other algorithm

1042
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,120
uh it's called k-means and k-means is a

1043
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,399
clustering algorithm

1044
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,240
and you can see here that it created

1045
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,519
this lovely cluster

1046
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,159
and then this tale of outliers at this

1047
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:02,720
point

1048
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,880
it's sesame street math which of these

1049
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,399
things are not like the other

1050
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,880
we don't know why these are outliers

1051
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,240
after just running it through the

1052
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,120
algorithm

1053
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,279
but with some simple googling you come

1054
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,200
down here to the list of providers these

1055
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,320
are the doctors

1056
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,880
you'll find that john couch here is in

1057
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,519
jail

1058
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,559
for 240 months for prescription fraud

1059
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:23,679
we didn't know what was going to come

1060
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:26,080
out of it but that was an interesting

1061
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:26,640
outlier

1062
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,000
if we were to scroll further down

1063
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,760
there's another doctor

1064
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,080
and by the way he was an outlier because

1065
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,919
of the number of prescriptions he was

1066
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:35,200
writing he was writing

1067
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,200
way more than other doctors who are

1068
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,120
writing if we scroll further down

1069
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,919
we'll find another doctor who um the

1070
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,679
reason that doctor was an outlier

1071
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,320
is that he was a pediatrician and

1072
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,919
remember these are opioids and i don't

1073
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:49,279
know too many two-year-olds

1074
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,360
that need oxycontin on a regular basis

1075
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,200
although every time i fly there always

1076
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,960
seems to be one that i really wish had

1077
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,559
but i digress so um so just by simply

1078
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:01,360
uh using some very simple algorithms

1079
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,640
against a data set

1080
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,120
you can start looking for weird stuff

1081
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,039
this could be very helpful for hunters

1082
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:09,199
you could leverage this against you know

1083
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,440
weird traffic sessions weird protocols

1084
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,599
all sorts of stuff with the organization

1085
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,520
um i've seen it used all the time to

1086
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:15,918
catch

1087
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,960
fraud actually so things like

1088
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,879
online fraud or uh loyalty fraud like

1089
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:23,918
with

1090
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:25,839
loyalty points and things like that we

1091
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:28,000
can we can apply something as simple as

1092
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,480
this

1093
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,119
and then look for the outliers in those

1094
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:31,839
uh

1095
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,079
web transactions and start finding fraud

1096
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:34,879
that way too

1097
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:36,639
very clever and if you can start finding

1098
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,560
fraud for your organization

1099
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,280
you might get them to give you some more

1100
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,800
budget

1101
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,520
uh so hopefully this was a great set of

1102
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,280
tips and tricks i hope everybody found

1103
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,639
at least one gemma

1104
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,159
out of it that they can leverage back at

1105
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,239
their own organization uh

1106
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,159
so go out there and use it because only

1107
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,359
you

1108
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,240
can prevent infosec dumpster fires um i

1109
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,599
hope you guys have a lot of fun with

1110
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:00,480
this if you do

1111
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,480
if something works for you let me know

1112
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,160
or if you come up with a great idea let

1113
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:04,800
me know

1114
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,960
because i love sharing this with

1115
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,720
organizations who are struggling with

1116
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,280
budget

1117
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,280
who need free ways to shore up their

1118
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,440
things so you can contact me uh here if

1119
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,160
you like
