1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,159
now our next speaker disclosing speaker

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:05,130
is Chris kubecka I mentioned her in the

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,779
opening but I have to mention it again

4
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:09,450
she is a very very unique very special

5
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,120
individual I first met her at the DEFCON

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,040
hacking conference where we both

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,289
attended a dinner with Congress people

8
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:19,080
who came to DEFCON and the Congress

9
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,050
people were as confused as we were and

10
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,750
the entire situation but it was just one

11
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,300
example of how the hacker community

12
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,099
connects outside the boundaries which is

13
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:30,570
what we had besides Tel Aviv are all

14
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,989
about so Chris go Becca this unique

15
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:35,550
speaker there's so many interesting

16
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,739
facts to say about her where should we

17
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:39,629
start I first met her DEFCON I mentioned

18
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:41,879
this oh she's one of the first people to

19
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:45,750
get married at DEFCON yes

20
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,149
that's a that's a thing you don't just

21
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:49,950
go to Vegas to get married you go to a

22
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,079
hacking convention in Vegas to get

23
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,149
married and that's what Chris Kubica did

24
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:58,410
she is the CEO and founder of hyper sec

25
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,780
where she offers incident management

26
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,809
ethical hacking training services and

27
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:07,229
advisory services to governments prior

28
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:09,510
to hyper sec Chris headed the

29
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,689
information protection group and

30
00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:14,280
international intelligence for Saudi

31
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,330
Aramco

32
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,880
I think they're the biggest oil company

33
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,659
in the world after the 2012 Shamoon

34
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,049
attack which wiped many of our uncle's

35
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:27,420
computers she was the one whose job it

36
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,670
was to reestablish international

37
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,680
business operations and implement

38
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,869
digital security following this attack

39
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:35,759
which deeply affected not just the

40
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,670
company but the entire in a region the

41
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,530
countries of Saudi Arabia Qatar in

42
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,229
Bahrain and the entire oil production

43
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:44,970
and supply chain really if you think

44
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,790
about it Chris is a United States Air

45
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,970
Force veteran United States Air Force is

46
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,430
a very friendly force to the Israeli Air

47
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,930
Force which is the friendliest force

48
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,909
towards the IDF it was a joke in the

49
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:58,979
beginning if you're still with me I hope

50
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:01,469
you got it and she is also the author of

51
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:04,320
several books on the subject of open

52
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,799
source intelligence or Ostend Chris has

53
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:10,169
so many interesting stories and amazing

54
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:12,209
life experiences to share with us so I'm

55
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:13,560
just going to let her

56
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,480
with herself because I don't think I

57
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,850
could ever ever cover the incredible

58
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:20,430
life and journey that Crisco Becca has

59
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,550
had now do we have Chris live are we

60

00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,590
interesting for you I'm going to

72
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,410
describe some fantastically wonderful

73
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:02,010
not sometimes so wonderful adventures

74
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,370
I've had involving at the new cyber cold

75
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:10,380
war by proxy Saudi versus Iran so a

76
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,780
little bit more about me thank you so

77
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,650
much Karen as I do a lot of work within

78
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:20,579
the critical infrastructure realm from

79
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:23,450
oil and gas all the way to nuclear and

80
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:26,340
my first career was an aviator in the US

81
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,980
Air Force as a loadmaster my second

82
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,480
career was with command and control

83
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,930
systems for Space Command and the

84
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,930
picture that you see on the side I

85
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,760
unfortunately had a little bit too much

86
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,980
time and technology at my fingertips at

87
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:41,880
the age of 10

88
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,010
so I was busted hacking into the

89
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,410
Department of Justice when I was allowed

90
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,359
to use a computer almost eight years

91
00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:51,660
later the US Air Force kindly uh molded

92
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,420
me into the person I am today

93
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,980
so we've been talking a lot about

94
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,890
hackers today good hackers bad hackers

95
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:01,620
and sometimes a nation-state hackers and

96
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,290
we have to remember that the more things

97
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,690
that we connect to the Internet as we

98
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,030
move forward we're going to have a lot

99
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,400
more entry and exit points that are

100
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,540
exposed and almost every organization no

101
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,100
matter how new and how much money they

102
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,260
have they're going to have some sort of

103
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,899
legacy equipment we have to deal with

104
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:24,150
nation-states we also have to deal with

105
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:27,120
what we call patriotic hackers that may

106
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,530
or may not be funded by these

107
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,720
nation-states and whether we're talking

108
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,150
about superpowers or countries that want

109
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,220
to be superpowers at least of their

110
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,090
region third parties leave us exposed we

111
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,880
cannot operate in technological

112
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,830
isolation and still the majority of

113
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:47,310
companies and many governments don't

114
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,979
take the risk of cyber security and

115
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:52,680
major cyber incidents seriously so they

116
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,800
don't prepare properly so there are a

117
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,919
lot of actors that are in operation in

118
00:04:58,919 --> 00:04:59,790
the

119
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:02,700
least right now some of them however

120
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,550
aren't actually in the Middle East so

121
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,670
we're looking at not so nice folks

122
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:13,280
sometimes from China North Korea Russia

123
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,960
the United States sometimes gets in the

124
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,560
mix and it causes a very very

125
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,800
interesting state of affairs when it

126
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,830
comes to what goes on in the Middle East

127
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:29,640
so Saudi and Iran I quite like this

128
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,620
graphic because we have no idea what

129
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,960
round they're on but they keep fighting

130
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,890
and Iran has certain reasons why they

131
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:41,040
want to harm the Saudi Arabian economy

132
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,410
and especially the oil markets if a

133
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,620
barrel of oil is at a certain rate they

134
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,180
actually make money because it costs

135
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,390
them far much more money to actually

136
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:56,730
produce a barrel of refined oil so one

137
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:59,400
of my favorite quotes from a former CEO

138
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,370
of Saudi Aramco is never underestimate

139
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,110
how dependent you are on your

140
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,390
information technology and systems it's

141
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,220
become like oxygen you can't live

142
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,200
without it you think you can live

143
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,420
without it but you can't and here we all

144
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,150
are in this hybrid event without the

145
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:19,170
technology that we love and is so near

146
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,910
and dear to our hearts we could not be

147
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:23,100
at this conference but think about all

148
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,460
of the other things that run on various

149
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,950
different types of networks and

150
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,000
technology and we're talking about

151
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,520
everyday things in your home - things

152
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,850
like power being delivered to your home

153
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:38,940
so in 2012 there was a very interesting

154
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,620
will say attack against Saudi Aramco

155
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,810
prior to the actual time bomb that went

156
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:49,320
off there were two instances of domain

157
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,470
administrators in Saudi Arabia at Saudi

158
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:55,350
Aramco that were fished successfully and

159
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,990
this gave them Kings to the kingdom so

160
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:01,380
to speak now at the time Saudi Aramco

161
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,530
did have what they called a security

162
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,750
operation center I would not call it

163
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:10,650
that and some of the IT people from

164
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:12,960
Houston saw that there was indicator

165
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,240
of compromise that someone was on the

166
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,940
network and they called them up over to

167
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,430
Saudi Arabia and said hey you know um

168
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,770
we're seeing a domain admin that's

169
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:25,530
logged in to 250 different devices at

170
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,960
the same time we're not security people

171
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,180
but we think this is kind of strange

172
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,050
unfortunately the manager at the time

173
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,479
said we're going through an ISO

174
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:37,770
certification you know we have auditors

175
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,800
how dare you call me

176
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,569
so then Europe started to get involved

177
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:44,789
from the European headquarters and up

178
00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:46,500
until two days before the attack

179
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,560
occurred on the 15th of August contacted

180
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,900
the same manager on his day off and said

181
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,419
listen we are seeing very clear

182
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:56,849
indicators of compromises and the

183
00:07:56,849 --> 00:07:58,560
manager by the way who was not the

184
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,259
manager anymore said how dare you call

185
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:03,330
me on my day off so there were some

186
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:06,180
cultural issues between the various

187
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,720
offices and also the fact that at the

188
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,659
time Saudi Aramco truly did not think

189
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,539
that they would ever be targeted

190
00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:17,370
unfortunately pastebin was found two

191
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:20,970
hours before the attack there was a time

192
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:23,340
bomb a logic bomb and things started to

193
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:28,500
get wiped now they did try their best to

194
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,599
protect the production but on their

195
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:34,200
business Network they had pretty much no

196
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,570
real protection they had near zero

197
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:39,120
visibility they did not encrypt

198
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,890
internally so you could reset your

199
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,620
domain password over a web interface

200
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,990
that was only HTTP completely

201
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:47,850
unencrypted so it was very easy for

202
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,620
attackers to move throughout the network

203
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,470
both with the domain admin credentials

204
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,810
but also to sniff credentials now

205
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:58,079
attackers aren't going to strike you

206
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,990
when everybody's at work

207
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,420
they're going to strike when they have

208
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,010
an opportunity and what better

209
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:07,470
opportunity then for example the holy

210
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:09,570
month of Ramadan and on a holiday during

211
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,430
the holy month of Ramadan and that's

212
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,920
exactly what happened so there were less

213
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,260
people who could see what was going on

214
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,990
who could react to the attack and who

215
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:23,270
could help out as quickly as possible

216
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,100
they had no incident management plan

217
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,170
that involved a cybersecurity attack

218
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:30,140
they did have safety incident plans on

219
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,450
the production but that was it and they

220
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:35,029
had previous to the attack decided to

221
00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:37,220
digitize everything which sounds like a

222
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:40,880
great idea except if all of your contact

223
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,940
lists are now on SharePoint and 85% of

224
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:46,180
your Windows computer systems are wiped

225
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:49,580
so when they went to call people they

226
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,740
couldn't find lists so of course has

227
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:54,500
caused a lot of chaos and they did the

228
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,760
only thing that they could at the time

229
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,980
and I believe it's the first time ever

230
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,920
such a large company actually

231
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,390
disconnected themselves from the

232
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:04,399
Internet now that also involved

233
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,980
disconnecting vendors from supporting

234
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,839
their oil production platforms and

235
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:11,390
things that haven't been in the news is

236
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,910
Saudi Aramco provided two-thirds of the

237
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,920
mobile communications for the country

238
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,040
and that was knocked out they also

239
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,709
provided telecommunications services and

240
00:10:21,709 --> 00:10:24,290
Internet services for schools hospitals

241
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,730
emergency services police and these

242
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:31,010
particular services also were deeply

243
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:34,550
affected because the line was cut now

244
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,490
the picture that you see is actually

245
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:38,839
kilometres and kilometres of petrol

246
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:42,230
trucks that due to an industrial IOT

247
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,180
system connected to their windows-based

248
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,970
payment systems they could not actually

249
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:49,399
fill any of these tanker trucks which

250
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,920
meant that you could not get petrol if

251
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,770
you drove to your local petrol station

252
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:57,980
and a country only has a certain amount

253
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,470
of strategic supply and obviously

254
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:03,110
because of the geopolitics involved in

255
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:05,870
Saudi Arabia their strategic supply was

256
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:08,810
reserved for military use this picture

257
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:12,350
was actually taken 13 days after the

258
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:15,290
initial attack by a Saudi journalist who

259
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:18,440
unfortunately was never seen again

260
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,620
one day after the attack Qatar's Raz gas

261
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,779
was hit with a different variant the

262
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:25,370
only difference between the two variants

263
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:27,529
of Shamoon were that Saudi Aramco had a

264
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:30,200
burning American flag as it was actually

265
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:35,110
wiping so we've had several instances

266
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,320
some

267
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,080
hit the news and some have not soon

268
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,330
after we recovered and implemented

269
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:43,010
digital security there was a company

270
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:45,350
decision that said we have to protect

271
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,930
ourselves from getting our desktops and

272
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:50,060
other things wiped so the company

273
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:53,900
decided to purchase a solution called

274
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:58,420
virtual desktop and this seemed like a a

275
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,070
magical thing except for the fact that

276
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,350
the third-party vendor who I believe was

277
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:06,650
Hitachi left a technician backdoor on

278
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:09,860
all of the images and it was set to

279
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:12,800
admin admin and the attackers could

280
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,660
easily find this information because

281
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,940
Hitachi had actually left the user

282
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,790
manual up on their website and so the

283
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,880
attackers use that information and

284
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,500
started actually affecting the systems

285
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,770
luckily it could be stopped but we've

286
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:29,960
had several variants which have moved

287
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,190
beyond just Saudi Aramco and have

288
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,510
actually targeted and aimed against

289
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:37,610
Saudi critical infrastructure so we're

290
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:39,500
talking about electric we're talking

291
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,820
about airports and in addition to that

292
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,470
there have been numerous physical

293
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:48,020
attacks both against critical

294
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,910
infrastructure in Saudi Arabia and

295
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:53,450
against Saudi Aramco we've had lovely

296
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:55,700
jubbly drones with bombs hopefully

297
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,230
that's not what Intel is given away free

298
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:01,070
as prizes and even rockets come out of

299
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:05,810
the country of Yemen now there are lots

300
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:08,510
of players in the Middle East and they

301
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:11,450
can affect the world in different ways

302
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:14,180
so when we take a look at Syria Syria is

303
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:17,420
rather unique early on they had groups

304
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,960
of what I would call patriotic hackers

305
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,750
if not state-sponsored hacker groups and

306
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,060
they openly allowed their networks to be

307
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,340
used for cyber attacks against anyone

308
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:32,000
they perceived as enemies now a few

309
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,760
years ago a hacker group the Syrian

310
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,670
electronic army was able to get into the

311
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,590
Associated Press's Twitter account

312
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:42,020
because at the time Twitter did not use

313
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,270
two-factor authentication they were

314
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,740
actually late comers in the game

315
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,500
unfortunately one thing that may not

316
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,510
have hit the news

317
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,730
after the tweet was sent that the White

318
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,890
House had basically been bombed and the

319
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,150
President of the United States was

320
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,820
injured this affected worldwide markets

321
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,520
the CERN electronic army also took over

322
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,620
the Saudi Aramco Twitter account and

323
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,900
started tweeting out harmful things to

324
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:10,600
the oil market as well so sometimes as

325
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,310
we've been seeing more and more there is

326
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,170
a mix between digital attacks and

327
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:18,610
physical attacks and in late 2014

328
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:21,160
there was one such attack that almost

329
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,130
killed a lot of people and the city of

330
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,260
The Hague in the Netherlands which is

331
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,990
known as the city of peace where the

332
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:31,750
International Criminal Court is and a

333
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,760
lot of other organizations like that I

334
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,850
was attempting to have lunch which was a

335
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:40,330
rarity because of my role and a large

336
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:42,460
man in a very nicely tailored suit came

337
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,950
to get me from our cafeteria and said I

338
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:49,210
needed to be summoned immediately when I

339
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:51,220
talked to my managing director he sent

340
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,980
me directly to the Royal Saudi Arabian

341
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,980
embassy of The Hague and what looked to

342
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,010
be at first a very simple email hack

343
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:03,970
turned into all of the embassies of the

344
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,850
Hague's being threatened over 400

345
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:09,160
dignitaries lives being threatened a

346
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,920
cyber terrorism and real-life terrorism

347
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,680
group a nation-state because it's all

348
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,140
about fun with you know nation-states

349
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,480
nothing is crazier the nations stayed

350
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,990
crazy and several embassies had to put a

351
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:25,060
disclaimer on their website about what

352
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:28,300
was going on and when I first arrived

353
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,810
there were a lot of problems the embassy

354
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:35,530
did not use antivirus for example and it

355
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,630
was the IT persons second day on the job

356
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:40,930
with no handover whatsoever and they

357
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,550
could not get a hold of the previous

358
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:45,340
person so we started locking down things

359
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:49,450
taking Network packet captures and so

360
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:52,750
forth and I asked the IT person I go

361
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,340
okay so we've got to start locking down

362
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:57,340
your email because obviously your email

363
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:00,400
has been hacked into because there's all

364
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,400
these suspicious emails like send us 200

365
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,130
dollars via MoneyGram and will expedite

366
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:08,710
your visa fee signed the secretary of

367
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:12,670
the embassy which did not happen and it

368
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:15,280
turns out that the password still one of

369
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,840
the most popular passwords in the world

370
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,320
one two three four five six I'll let you

371
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,150
think about that and please if you have

372
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,890
anything that has one two three four

373
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:28,810
five six please change this now so with

374
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:30,250
the network packet capture one of the

375
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,840
things that we found was there was a

376
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,490
rootkit that was installed on the

377
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:35,890
ambassador's secretaries of work station

378
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:39,520
and we found that it was what we would

379
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,130
call commercial off-the-shelf malware

380
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:44,260
now what's interesting about this is in

381
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,150
the news you hear about these advanced

382
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:49,420
tools that nation-states use the problem

383
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:52,420
is they're expensive to produce and once

384
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,430
you use them they're burned you can't

385
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,680
really use them again and they're a bit

386
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,770
more easy to attribute so why not for

387
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:02,590
plausible deniability use and tweak some

388
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:05,050
commercial off-the-shelf well this was

389
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:08,890
the case and what we had what I also

390
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:10,839
found with my investigations that

391
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:14,040
although the perpetrator who was a

392
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,240
insider to the embassy who had

393
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,430
diplomatic immunity he thought that he

394
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:21,280
was working for Isis he was unaware of

395
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,109
the fact that actually his agent

396
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:27,220
handlers were from Iran if you're into

397
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,890
Star Trek Deep Space 9 there's actually

398
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:32,260
a great episode where the Kardashians do

399
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,260
the same type of thing but instead of

400
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,330
digital weapons with physical weapons

401
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:39,910
and we were having a very interesting

402
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:44,530
time because next door to my European

403
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:49,000
offices we had a situation where the

404
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,060
very nice house was bought with cash by

405
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:55,270
the Yemeni government and we believe

406
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:58,030
that the way that they got the money was

407
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:00,300
actually from the country of Iran and

408
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,790
this is how close they were to us so

409
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:06,190
Ramco overseas not in the embassy

410
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:09,250
district and right next door to us was

411
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,250
the embassy of Yemen so I was having a

412
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,920
meeting with my boss and I could look

413
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,840
out the windows behind him and

414
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,120
one day we see that we have surveillance

415
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,330
drones that are surveilling just RIT

416
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:26,799
floor and it turns out the drones pretty

417
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,510
nice ones too I might add

418
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:31,090
we're being flown by the Yemeni

419
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:34,059
government's embassy staff we also

420
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:37,270
caught them digging into our backyard to

421
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,919
try to get to our fiber network to

422
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:42,450
surveil it and we caught several embassy

423
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:46,809
employees inside our canteen and inside

424
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:50,200
our building and a few verbal

425
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,659
altercations between the two of us and

426
00:18:52,659 --> 00:18:57,370
this was all happening at one time so to

427
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,529
give you a background there are several

428
00:18:59,529 --> 00:19:03,750
rebel groups in Yemen one in particular

429
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:08,110
has said yes we're the ones who launched

430
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:11,470
bomb-laden drones but we also have seen

431
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:16,960
a technological shift from just drones

432
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,390
with surveillance to drones with bombs

433
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:23,080
they seem to love drones and one of the

434
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,059
ways we believe that they got some of

435
00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:28,149
this technology and also how they were

436
00:19:28,149 --> 00:19:31,390
taught how to use it was because they

437
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:33,520
have been openly funded by the Iranian

438
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,010
government in addition to that there

439
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:38,049
have also been joined campaigns both

440
00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:40,360
with Iran and with North Korea with this

441
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,899
rebel group so this was a very long

442
00:19:43,899 --> 00:19:45,490
incident and lasted almost two and a

443
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:48,279
half months usually they don't last that

444
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:52,299
long and in between I was called back to

445
00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:55,120
the embassy and it turns out that things

446
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,260
had gotten worse and suddenly there were

447
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,929
bigger extortion attempts it raised from

448
00:20:01,929 --> 00:20:03,880
a two hundred dollar extortion attempt

449
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,580
to twenty five thousand an email was

450
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,470
sent to several Middle Eastern countries

451
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:12,070
in the country of Turkey signed by Isis

452
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:15,990
and sent by the Embassy's official

453
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:18,700
back-channel email account now

454
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,830
unfortunately although they are a great

455
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:21,820
group when they're trying to be

456
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:25,090
proactive the diplomatic corps did not

457
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:28,059
speak to us into the embassy before they

458
00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:29,610
decided to act

459
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:32,100
and what they did was they sent an email

460
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,580
to all of the embassies in The Hague a

461
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:38,160
warning saying hey we've gotten

462
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,320
information that some of you embassies

463
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,320
are getting extortion attempts by Isis

464
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,670
to pay you $25,000 each and if you get

465
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,740
this email please contact us and we'll

466
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,740
try to help now they sent the email via

467
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:57,480
CC not BCC and also put on that email

468
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,549
the Saudi Arabian embassy unbeknownst to

469
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:02,220
them the perpetrator was still inside

470
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,460
the email so the perpetrators decided to

471
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:08,610
respond both to the diplomatic corps and

472
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:11,010
to every single embassy in the hague and

473
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:14,700
said hey guess what we now have your

474
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,950
attention the price is going to go up

475
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:19,770
and they started taunting all of the

476
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:21,660
embassies in the diplomatic corps and

477
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:24,900
started threatening this is actually a

478
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,080
sanitized copy of the email it's always

479
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,030
nice to know exactly who you are up

480
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:32,429
against because they were just trying to

481
00:21:32,429 --> 00:21:33,720
save many lives

482
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,480
signed Isis and also signed the Saudi

483
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,070
embassy so in between this as I'm trying

484
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,960
to figure out who the perpetrator is and

485
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,240
to find proof since it was a long

486
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,549
incident and I kind of like beer I used

487
00:21:47,549 --> 00:21:53,700
to stop by my local pub and my my good

488
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,380
friend the bartender an owner before I

489
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,960
stepped into the building said you've

490
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,000
got three people that have been waiting

491
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,370
at the bar for you for hours just

492
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:05,340
sipping tea and I happen to be with one

493
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,710
of my counterparts from the u.s. from

494
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:10,169
Aramco and we thought obviously this was

495
00:22:10,169 --> 00:22:13,080
a little strange walk in introduce

496
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,140
myself ask what's going on all three of

497
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:19,290
them give me business cards stating that

498
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:21,510
they are cultural attache --zz from the

499
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:24,360
Turkish embassy in the Netherlands and

500
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,740
they want English lessons

501
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:28,620
now what was quite funny about that was

502
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:32,700
they all spoke English and after

503
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,679
contacting security services because

504
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:36,809
obviously this was very strange they

505
00:22:36,809 --> 00:22:39,929
were indeed cultural attache --zz with

506
00:22:39,929 --> 00:22:42,330
diplomatic immunity from the Turkish

507
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:43,350
embassy

508
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:45,450
so I was given permission to engage

509
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:47,820
because they wanted to know on what was

510
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,250
going on but I had protection at a

511
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:53,610
distance at the same time I was also

512
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:56,130
told that I was found on a top ten list

513
00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:01,559
for kidnap or well murder

514
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:04,860
I was actually number two on that list

515
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:08,130
for Isis and this lasted for about two

516
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:10,110
and a half weeks it was conversational

517
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:12,210
English where they tried to ask a lot of

518
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:13,919
questions about the infrastructure of

519
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,429
Saudi Aramco and before they left the

520
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:20,010
country very suddenly the lead agent

521
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:23,820
gave me if you can see some prayer beads

522
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:27,480
which I also had checked out by security

523
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,909
services because you never know what

524
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:31,740
materials or if it's bugged or

525
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,730
what-have-you

526
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:35,010
so after they were checked out luckily

527
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:39,270
they let me keep them and it culminated

528
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:41,820
with the Secretary's personal gmail

529
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,460
account being hacked into it hacked into

530
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,799
and when I was able to kick them out of

531
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,900
the email system they started sending

532
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:52,169
emails from other accounts they finally

533
00:23:52,169 --> 00:23:54,090
threatened that they would blow up a

534
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:56,330
national landmark called the Kerr house

535
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:59,880
during national Saudi day where a lot of

536
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,669
dignitaries Dutch royalty ambassadors

537
00:24:02,669 --> 00:24:06,570
from all over the world including you

538
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,760
know ambassador from Japan and so forth

539
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,130
and they said if we did not pay them the

540
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:13,470
fifty million they would actually blow

541
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:16,559
up the hotel with everyone in it luckily

542
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,559
I was able to find the perpetrator and

543
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:22,350
neutralize the threat so what does

544
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:24,659
turkey have to do with it well they're a

545
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:26,520
very interesting country because they

546
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,450
have been upping their offensive cyber

547
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:33,330
security talents quite a bit they have a

548
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:35,570
mix between nation state and also

549
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:38,370
patriotic hackers now I live in the

550
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:39,929
Netherlands and we've actually seen some

551
00:24:39,929 --> 00:24:42,419
of this where there's been manipulation

552
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:47,490
of some of our elections to back certain

553
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:50,340
Turkish related parties within the

554
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,980
Netherlands they've also been able to

555
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,720
break into various intelligence agencies

556
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,090
including the Saudi minister

557
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:00,150
Foreign Affairs and it's a somewhat

558
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:03,000
well-known not very secret anymore that

559
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,300
Turkey has aided Isis being in oil

560
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,550
middlemen so to speak service allowing

561
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:11,910
convoys of oil coming from a terrorist

562
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,160
group to go through Turkey than to be

563
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:18,180
sold further on so then we've got other

564
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:21,110
groups which are you know mix between

565
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:26,670
government and perhaps could be some

566
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:29,930
terrorist activity and it looks like we

567
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:32,130
what we have observed is they've been

568
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:36,390
taking a page from Iran because they're

569
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:38,400
using some of the same techniques that

570
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,300
they used to use early on so if for some

571
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,430
odd reason you get really popular on

572
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:46,050
Facebook and a lot of really

573
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:48,120
good-looking women or men just start

574
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,040
sending you pictures and saying hey

575
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:54,150
there you might be targeted because of

576
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:57,300
your role within your organization or

577
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,720
your government etc and they can be

578
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,850
quite elaborate the different types of

579
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:05,610
false identities they set up there is

580
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:07,770
some malware usage and definitely a lot

581
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:10,140
of surveillance where usage if you

582
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:15,390
happen to get hooked so if you don't

583
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:18,660
have the people for offensive cyber

584
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,460
capabilities or surveillance

585
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:23,130
capabilities but you have the money you

586
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:28,230
can be like UAE and you can hire people

587
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:30,390
who used to work for US intelligence

588
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:33,720
agencies this is actually a quote from a

589
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,460
person that was interviewed for project

590
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,190
Ravan where the average rate of pay was

591
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:40,320
about 1 million dollars a year to work

592
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,750
for UAE and it's a good way to

593
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:46,110
supplement so we have new terms cyber

594
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:49,470
mercenaries and unfortunately they can

595
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:51,330
either be directly hired by the

596
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:52,500
government depending on their

597
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,410
nationality or they can work via private

598
00:26:55,410 --> 00:27:01,370
companies to skirt those limitations so

599
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:03,480
most recently

600
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,309
this year there was a news article that

601
00:27:05,309 --> 00:27:08,400
came out about me because the Iranian

602
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,130
government had a two and a half year

603
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:14,460
campaign to try to recruit me to work

604
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,460
inside of the country of Iran and to

605
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:20,100
teach them how to hack into critical

606
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,770
infrastructure with the focus on nuclear

607
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:26,370
facilities and it was it was quite

608
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:27,690
interesting because they were very

609
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:30,510
persistent it started with a very

610
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:34,260
general basic vanilla LinkedIn message

611
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:37,440
asking for remote teaching contract

612
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,700
which I was a bit dubious of because of

613
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,799
my city because of my citizenship and

614
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:45,660
various sanctions I can't really just

615
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:49,200
give services to the main or Iranian

616
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,700
telecom so what started out as basic

617
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,880
moved to encrypted communications lots

618
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,610
of meetings they tried to send me

619
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:03,179
various websites to look at and they

620
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:05,790
offered me a lot of money and trust me I

621
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:08,429
could have used a hundred thousand euro

622
00:28:08,429 --> 00:28:10,740
a month which is what their offer was

623
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:14,640
and they kept it up going from US two

624
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,150
and a half years and they had set up

625
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:21,900
this very very elaborate campaign many

626
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:25,559
many fake websites different sock

627
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:28,350
puppets or personas the person who first

628
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:30,809
contacted me was what we would call an

629
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:33,780
ancient handler who tries to recruit you

630
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,880
this is actually the photograph that he

631
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,549
uses on LinkedIn and if you do reverse

632
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:40,230
image search on this you can see that

633
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:42,780
it's a stock photo they had found out

634
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,610
that I was a lecturer for centuries for

635
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:46,590
the protection of critical national

636
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:50,549
infrastructure as part of GCHQ and the

637
00:28:50,549 --> 00:28:52,860
united kingdom and that i had spoken at

638
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:56,010
nuclear cybersecurity conferences before

639
00:28:56,010 --> 00:29:00,059
and i'd also lectured on-site at

640
00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:02,580
multiple nuclear facilities power plants

641
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:06,030
and enrichment plants and that all kind

642
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,740
of came to a screeching in because

643
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,960
during this time i kept sending the

644
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,480
information to an FBI agent who worked

645
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,760
in a cyber division

646
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,050
unfortunately that FBI agent i don't

647
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:17,040
know what happened may

648
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,170
he didn't take me seriously I kept

649
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:21,780
sending names and he never sent it to

650
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:24,180
the appropriate offices within the FBI

651
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:27,540
so I thought it must not be that serious

652
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:31,260
and then last January I got a whatsapp

653
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:34,250
message from the agent handler from Iran

654
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:37,260
asking me if I could send my home

655
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:39,690
address so that he could send me a gift

656
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:42,510
and when I got the message I was at a

657
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:44,160
retirement ceremony for one of my

658
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,060
friends at West Point and I was giggling

659
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:49,710
having some drinks after this ceremony

660
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:51,960
and the person next to me happened to

661
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,420
work in the counterterrorism division

662
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:56,610
and worked with the FBI and he took it

663
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:59,070
very seriously and so put me in touch

664
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:02,160
with the appropriate teams and obviously

665
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,290
I did not accept the gift and at the

666
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:06,330
same time he disclosed to me that the

667
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:08,730
Netherlands government had found out

668
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:10,970
that the Iranian government had hired

669
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:13,680
contract killers to kill two people here

670
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,360
in the Netherlands who were Iranian

671
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:21,360
exiles so I'm not one to sit around and

672
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,720
I wanted a little bit of revenge so I

673
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,360
read up a bit about some new laws in

674
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,960
Iran and one of them was because of

675
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,120
certain religious beliefs they decided

676
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,610
that they would mandate any makes gender

677
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:38,070
restaurant or entertainment facility to

678
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:40,770
be watched by IOT cameras by the

679
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:43,770
religious portion of their police and I

680
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:46,890
like IOT cameras as in I like breaking

681
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:49,680
into IOT cameras so I saw this as a

682
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:53,550
great opportunity to peer into all of

683
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:57,120
Iran and it turns out you can do that

684
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:02,160
too so I put a very very basic way that

685
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,570
you can actually find some of these

686
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:06,720
Iranian cameras with just this dork in

687
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,930
census I oh you can find over 10

688
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:13,800
thousand and also a fun tip they can

689
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:18,000
only find by certain materials from

690
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,100
certain countries so in this case their

691
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:23,460
most popular type of IOT camera happens

692
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,170
to be hikvision and if you use

693
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:27,300
Metasploit at all there's at least two

694
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,220
modules you can go ahead and hack into

695
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,010
it

696
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:32,260
but because it's countrywide you don't

697
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,540
really need to hack they're all set with

698
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,309
the same default credentials of admin

699
00:31:36,309 --> 00:31:40,210
admin so luckily I shared this with a

700
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:43,360
friend who is the chief strategist for a

701
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,850
particular very friendly intelligence

702
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:48,309
organization who is very very pleased

703
00:31:48,309 --> 00:31:51,280
that now they could use it for facial

704
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,049
recognition listen to voice

705
00:31:53,049 --> 00:31:55,059
conversations if they want and even

706
00:31:55,059 --> 00:31:58,900
remotely improve the resolution so be

707
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:02,620
your own spy now we've talked a bit

708
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,090
about Cova today and I'm going to

709
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:07,150
introduce a new term be Yoh bring your

710
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:09,700
own house everything has been turned

711
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,640
remote including more and more critical

712
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,280
infrastructure and the idea that there

713
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,140
is perimeter security when you have to

714
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:22,210
work from home that idea is gone it was

715
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:25,450
talked about earlier are corporations

716
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:28,830
buying firewalls for their employees

717
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:33,220
probably not that many are doing that so

718
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:35,590
I scan the internet using a tool

719
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:38,010
recently and I got the top 10 countries

720
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:40,870
the yellow bar you see is the total

721
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:42,700
number of things that say hello on the

722
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:45,970
internet the orange bar is things that

723
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:49,150
have remote protocols and use that have

724
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:51,669
known exploitable vulnerabilities like

725
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:54,760
FTP old versions of SSH Remote Desktop

726
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:59,080
Protocol VNC etc and what we can see is

727
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,059
there's a lot of vulnerabilities out

728
00:33:01,059 --> 00:33:03,549
there that have been increased with

729
00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:06,820
turning things remote which just means

730
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,860
another entry point that you can get

731
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:11,740
into and many of these assets and the

732
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,380
yellow actually have multiple

733
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:17,679
vulnerabilities so why is this all

734
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:20,440
important tomorrow July 3rd I've been

735
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:23,620
invited by the United Nations Institute

736
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:27,940
for disarmament research to give a brief

737
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:30,520
presentation with the head of Swiss

738
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,530
intelligence and a senior director of

739
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:36,700
Microsoft on what to do about malicious

740
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:39,220
attacks against critical infrastructure

741
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:41,260
and what sort of joint response we

742
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,210
should think about because this idea

743
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:43,809
that

744
00:33:43,809 --> 00:33:46,330
warfare doesn't exist or it's just a

745
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:51,820
myth or an airport novel is no more so

746
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,590
these slides will be posted if not with

747
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:56,139
security besides Tel Aviv but I also use

748
00:33:56,139 --> 00:33:58,450
ResearchGate so I put in some references

749
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:01,929
for everyone a couple of slides and just

750
00:34:01,929 --> 00:34:04,299
to give a big shout out to Karen and the

751
00:34:04,299 --> 00:34:07,419
B sides Tel Aviv group Dutch Oh sync guy

752
00:34:07,419 --> 00:34:09,309
helped with some of the research on

753
00:34:09,309 --> 00:34:11,770
unravelling some of the Iranians

754
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:14,289
elaborate campaign against me

755
00:34:14,289 --> 00:34:16,179
with some work with an investigative

756
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,159
reporter with the Wall Street Journal

757
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,969
and if you want to keep in touch I

758
00:34:20,969 --> 00:34:24,579
checked Twitter and also LinkedIn so

759
00:34:24,579 --> 00:34:27,720
thank you very much everyone
