1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:02,639
now i'm very very excited to introduce

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:03,360
our next

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,640
speaker this particular talk is one i am

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,280
specifically super hyped about because

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,719
it's a topic that i love

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,280
and a fantastic speaker and adi is such

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,360
a nice speaker as well she's a very very

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,440
nice person i just met her backstage

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,880
and we're really really happy to have

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,960
adi here because uh adi

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,880
has never presented at b sites tel aviv

12
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,199
before so we're super excited

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,119
to have a d on the stage let me tell you

14
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,480
a little bit about the talk

15
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,279
and about a d okay so this talk is now

16
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:32,479
you tcp

17
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,960
me now you don't and that is such a

18
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,960
clever statement adi i'm gonna get a

19
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,920
t-shirt made

20
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,559
that says that because it's so so on

21
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:41,040
point

22
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,079
so now you tcp me now you don't this is

23
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,200
going to be about the

24
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,840
internet scanning tools like showdown

25
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,800
and other tools

26
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,960
i have known to feature showdown in many

27
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,840
of my talks

28
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,160
i use it for my security testing many

29
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,199
security pros

30
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,280
use tools like showdown and other

31
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,879
internet scanning services so this is

32
00:00:58,879 --> 00:00:59,600
what we're gonna

33
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,320
hear all about right now and adi ben

34
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,159
israel our next speaker

35
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,400
she is a really really fantastic nice

36
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,360
human being

37
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,520
and she loves the internet and she says

38
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,040
that she has loved the internet

39
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,240
even before she found ways to connect

40
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,680
into people's routers

41
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,159
so that's pretty cool adi and actually

42
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,320
she also likes to dance

43
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,119
and play the trombone but not at the

44
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,159
same time

45
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,400
although that is an incredible talent a

46
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,080
deep probably if you would play the

47
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,920
trombone and dance at the same time you

48
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,640
would have

49
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,119
uh you will be able to join the circus

50
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:33,840
uh but

51
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,240
thankfully for us adi is here with us as

52
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,840
a security professional

53
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,200
as an internet internet

54
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,960
astronaut if you were looking for

55
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,320
interesting things to find in the

internet world

57
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,560
and she's really passionate about

58
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,799
sharing her knowledge so please help me

59
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:49,520
in giving a

60
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,119
super warm welcome to adi ben israel

61
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,640

62
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,000
to have you with us

63
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,119
there you go adi hi i'm adi

64
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,600
and this is now you tcp me now you don't

65
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,439
the strengths and weaknesses of various

66
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,239
internet scanning services so

67
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,520
a little about me i am a former

68
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,200
a recovering internet security

69
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,440
researcher i did this for

70
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,000
five years and about half a year ago i

71
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,760
decided that i want to learn how to

72
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,040
program a bit

73
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,160
so i am now work at a storage company

74
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,640
called weka where i program in the very

75
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,599
common language

76
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,879
called d but i still keep up with

77
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,519
uh with the internet and networking by

78
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:34,000
uh

79
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,040
by being the one who installs all the

80
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,640
routers at every place i live

81
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,920
before we start two things the first

82
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,200
thing that's very important is that

83
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,440
everything i

84
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,280
talk is a free offering from all the

85
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,720
services i will talk about

86
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,480
i will not talk about any enterprise

87
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,120
options or anything that costs more than

88
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,599
giving up some personal details and

89
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,599
second there will be a quiz

90
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,680
on this so please join the v sites

91
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,200
workspace and

92
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,560
the 20 talk or 20 lobby channel to see

93
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,280
the to see to be part of the quiz

94
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,319
so first of all why scan the internet

95
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,480
well if you're asking this you're

96
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,040
probably looking at the wrong conference

97
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,159
we scan because we can the internet is a

98
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:22,959
safari

99
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,280
and scanning is just one of the many

100
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,360
ways to understand it

101
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,280
through scanning the internet we can

102
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,720
find new services

103
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,840
new resources and possibly even new

104
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,519
vulnerabilities

105
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,120
and you would think that the internet

106
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,440
was scanned from its inauguration

107
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,680
but that's not the case the the first

108
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,599
open scanning project was the lander

109
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,920
project in 2004

110
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,080
and they scanned the internet by running

111
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,360
a pin ping scan

112
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,040
on all on all ipv4 addresses

113
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,120
the map here this is the most famous

114
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,599
census map of the ipv4 addresses and

115
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,040
this was done in 2012.

116
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,319
so why not why don't why haven't

117
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,640
people scanned the internet well that's

118
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,159
because scanning is hard

119
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,720
if you scan on your home computer using

120
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,000
the regular bandwidth

121
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,959
it's very slow comparatively there are

122
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,120
for about 4 billion ip addresses and

123
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,360
about 65 000 ports

124
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,160
and combining them all together it would

125
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,560
take a very long time to scan the entire

126
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,840
internet

127
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,400
also isps don't really like you spamming

128
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,520
syn packets

129
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,440
trust me don't try this at home it's

130
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,560
very hard to get an isp to unblock you

131
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,199
so either you slow down your scanning

132
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,560
face considerably

133
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,919
or you start using a server or multiple

134
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,759
servers if you use servers you have to

135
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,320
get the data back somehow

136
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,759
and then you have to to save the data in

137
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,120
some sort of db

138
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,000
and if you scan only once instead and

139
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,160
and if you don't want to scan only once

140
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,880
and want to

141
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,960
scan the internet continuously you have

142
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,199
to have a lot of space

143
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,360
and you have to version the db because

144
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,600
you don't want previous data to override

145
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,080
the current data you have

146
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,120
and all of this is it would just take

147
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,479
too long for a security researcher as a

148
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:19,520
side job

149
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,520
if it's not some it's too much it takes

150
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,440
too much time and resources for security

151
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,000
researcher

152
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,440
on their own to do this but luckily it's

153
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,919
hard but it's not that hard

154
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,880
there are a lot of bots humans and

155
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,199
crawlers that scan the internet

156
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,080
because all the stuff i mentioned are

157
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,560
pretty

158
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,039
if you take this as a full-time job

159
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,520
they're not very difficult

160
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,400
but most of the most of the scanners on

161
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,720
the internet save data to themselves

162
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,800
this interesting thing is scanning an

163
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,560
internet scanning service does

164
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,080
is that it doesn't only scan the

165
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,720
internet but it also displays the data

166
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,400
in a way that is easy for users to

167
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,400
query and because of this

168
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,880
and the fact that regular security

169
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,919
researchers

170
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,880
on their day-to-day jobs would not be

171
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,160
able to do this

172
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,240
in their free time this democracizes

173
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,160
access to internet scale data sets

174
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,039
so the first scanning service and the

175
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,800
most popular one that i'm talking i'm

176
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,919
going to talk about

177
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,240
is the one that i also show here which

178
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,600
is choden

179
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,880
sheldon was founded in 2009 and

180
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,680
as far as i know it was the first public

181
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,520
internet scanning service

182
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,199
anything else that came beforehand has

183
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,759
been lost to the internet

184
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,800
there have been so many talks about

185
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,600
showdown and what it can show in 2015

186
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,039
they even tweeted

187
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,960
the control page of a particle

188
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,759
accelerator which is pretty cool

189
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,880
and one of the reasons that children is

190
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,120
popular is that

191
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,240
it has it was alone in the landscape for

192
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,759
about five years but and then

193
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,720
came along came census census was

194
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,360
started

195
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,800
as the zed map project in 2012

196
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,120
by a group of researchers in the

197
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,639
university of michigan

198
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,400
they wanted to see if the internet was

199
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,759
getting safer

200
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,520
by um want to see if the internet was

201
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,360
getting safer by trying to scan the

202
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,800
entire internet

203
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,880
and the way to do this and their

204
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,280
their new idea was to instead of

205
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,199
creating a full connection

206
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,280
just send tcp packets uh syn packets tcp

207
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,240
syn packets

208
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,919
and then if you get a result then the

209
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,160
port is open and then they have another

210
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,919
tool called that grab where that you can

211
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,199
get the full

212
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,000
hdp response or any other port data

213
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,080
you're looking for

214
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,080
they spun out into a company in 2017.

215
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,520
so how do we compare these two services

216
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,520
showdown has a more focused search for

217
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,599
example if you give it a

218
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,160
a string it will not look in the tls

219
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,039
certificate

220
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,160
for this data which census will but

221
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,400
this is because census indexes every

222
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,160
piece of data it receives

223
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,120
especially tls data which this is really

224
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,000
helpful if you

225
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,800
find a certificate a unique certificate

226
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,000
length i want to see

227
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,919
if there are any other ips that

228
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,919
have this length of certificate for

229
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,039
example

230
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,919
also census uses known tools since

231
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:30,479
census

232
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,760
is based on zmapp and zedgrav it's very

233
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,200
easy to um to check

234
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,519
what census missed or if there's

235
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,360
anything that could bypass

236
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,480
it this is a very interesting

237
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,519
and this helps as opposed to showdown

238
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,560
who's uh whose tools are proprietary a

239
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,080
point to showdown is that

240
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,480
it scans more ports children scanned

241
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,920
about a thousand two hundred thirty

242
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,120
fourth as opposed to

243
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,080
since this is a thousand forty it's not

244
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,880
a lot but you're

245
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,600
if you're looking for an esoteric port

246
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,880
this could make the difference

247
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,600
so we see see that we saw that scanning

248
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,399
is hard

249
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,200
we saw that scanning is not hard enough

250
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,040
so that nobody will do it and we found

251
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,279
two scanning services that exist

252
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,600
there must be more how can you find more

253
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,200
we need the opposite of a scanning

254
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,200
service and this is where gray noise

255
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,160
comes in

256
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,279
grey noise is a sensor network um

257
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,640
it is the opposite of showdown and

258
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,120
senses in a way that it is completely

259
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,160
passive

260
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,040
um greatness has served multiple servers

261
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,880
across the world in different autonomous

262
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,839
zones

263
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,200
and when a scanner

264
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,760
a showdown census or something

265
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,440
proprietary

266
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,240
tries to scan grey noise gray noise logs

267
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:50,959
ip

268
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,880
the four and the data received

269
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,120
now let's see what greenhouse has to say

270
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,920
about choden

271
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,720
this is the gray noise visualizer and if

272
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,200
i enter

273
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,680
showdown

274
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,160
i can see

275
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,120
i can see that it's loading but if we

276
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:33,680
if we let it load

277
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,680
okay if the demo isn't working let me

278
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:47,839
go and redo the the slides

279
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:29,839
okay let's look at them through here

280
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,839
here if we look at what showdown shows

281
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,760
with greatness here about showdown it

282
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,440
shows a lot of different

283
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,760
um the different ips that choden uses

284
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,120
and let's pick a specific one i can see

285
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,560
the ip that it scans from reverse dns

286
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,839
if it exists possible

287
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,200
scanning types and the number of ports

288
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,200
now remember that i told you that choden

289
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,240
scans about 1

290
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,440
240 ports they don't

291
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,600
actually document that anywhere what i

292
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,519
did is because grain was recognized as

293
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,680
both showdown and census

294
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,959
i took the reports that grain noise

295
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,720
recognized that diabetes that grain was

296
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,000
recognized as showdown

297
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,760
and the eyephase that is recognized as

298
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,120
synthesis

299
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,200
made a unique list of ports and compared

300
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,600
the two

301
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,120
so granois classifies all its ips

302
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,160
into three categories

303
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,200
every ip that it finds malicious unknown

304
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,600
and benign malicious ivs are those that

305
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,200
show indications of trying to brute

306
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,519
force passwords or scan for recognizable

307
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,200
exploits

308
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,160
unknown services just scan the internet

309
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,760
not for any specific re

310
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,040
um but grey noise doesn't recognize them

311
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,959
it doesn't know that it's showdown

312
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,920
for example or any other known scan or

313
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,519
google bot

314
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,399
and the benign are scans that choden

315
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,519
recognizes

316
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,800
such as jordan or census they might also

317
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,160
show indications

318
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,360
of sending a vulnerable packet but it's

319
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,079
possible

320
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,200
that but since greno is only a sensor

321
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,000
network and

322
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,959
doesn't um doesn't run a full

323
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,560
interaction it's possible that they

324
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,680
check only if

325
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,600
this um only send a vulnerable packet to

326
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,320
see if

327
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,399
they get the the expected

328
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,519
vulnerable response or if it's an iv

329
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,079
that close the vulnerability

330
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,560
so we talked about great uh showdown and

331
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,279
census

332
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,800
and we talked about grain noise and how

333
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,279
grainoids can recognize sodium census

334
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,959
so let's see what other scanning

335
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,320
services greenways recognizes

336
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,120
i'm going to talk about two of them onif

337
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,440
and rapid7

338
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,680
onif is a front scanning server that was

339
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,839
started in 2018

340
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,120
it's not it doesn't scan very many ports

341
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,880
only about 100

342
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,720
but it takes data from a bunch of

343
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,399
different places such as

344
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,880
it tries to resolve the ip to see what

345
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,320
where it's from

346
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,519
or it takes data from pastebin to see if

347
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,800
um if the ip um

348
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,000
was ever seen in different um in

349
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,199
different pasties and

350
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,639
rapid seven rapid 7 is interesting

351
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,560
because it displays the data much

352
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,760
differently

353
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,079
unlike all the other scanning services

354
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,800
which show the data

355
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,800
you give a single ip and they give you

356
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,040
the response in rapid 7

357
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,160
you find you get uh once a da

358
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,040
once a month you get a dump of for

359
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,920
example

360
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,199
all the http get responses that rapid

361
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,240
seven received

362
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,360
in the in the last month from 480

363
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,720
or port 5555 they have a list of ports

364
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,760
there

365
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,920
and this is really useful because

366
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,440
showdown

367
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,920
to get this data from showdown it would

368
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,519
take a lot of credits

369
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,199
and that's a lot of money and a lot of

370
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,279
other possible searches that

371
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:31,519
could happen but are all the data

372
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,839
are all the actors that green noise

373
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:34,560
defines

374
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,920
as benign really benign there's

375
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,880
pdr labs which called itself an internet

376
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,040
mapping experiment and an

377
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,199
industry research group i didn't find

378
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,639
much data about it

379
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,480
and it looks from gray noise it looks

380
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,120
like its scans are benign

381
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,079
they don't try they don't try to check

382
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,680
for any vulnerabilities

383
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,399
on the other hand there is stretchoid

384
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,320
this is stretchy's front page and the

385
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,759
only page you can find

386
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,880
on its website it pretty much says give

387
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,839
me your ip and i promise i won't scan

388
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,079
you

389
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,839
i don't really trust it and

390
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,279
it scans mostly from digitalocean which

391
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,600
is um which is a small cloud player

392
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,360
and unlike pdr labs it does send

393
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,079
vulnerable packets that contain

394
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,519
vulnerabilities

395
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,399
it's been seen to try uh to try to send

396
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,160
requests that exploit an elastic search

397
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,959
called the injection vulnerability

398
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,040
i'm not really sure what's going on

399
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,000
there

400
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,519
but it's very fishy

401
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,600
and now i want to talk about a service

402
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,959
that gray noise

403
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,240
recognizes but barely

404
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,440
um fofa uh grey noise has

405
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,480
only eight results for fosa

406
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,040
it's possible that this is because fofa

407
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:57,519
is

408
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,880
a chinese internet scanning service

409
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,000
as you can see from the text and what i

410
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,160
like about fofa is that it has

411
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,919
some things that stand apart from

412
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,679
showden and census

413
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,199
for example it displays data not only

414
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,599
for an ip it doesn't only show the last

415
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,799
ip

416
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,839
but it also shows data

417
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,240
from from before so if you want to look

418
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,280
at the lifespan of an

419
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,280
ip address fofa is a good place to look

420
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,039
also it um

421
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,000
it saves a lot of a lot more of the html

422
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,640
page

423
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,520
now i'll show this using anglerfish

424
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,640
anglerfish

425
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,400
is a honeypot whose uh

426
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,559
page is about forty thousand more than

427
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,480
forty thousand characters all of these

428
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,039
characters are vulnerable substrings

429
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:52,960
um that of substrings of router names

430
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,000
titles server names pretty much

431
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,280
what they're saying is come at me bro

432
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,440
just try to exploit anything you can on

433
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,880
me

434
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,160
and while showdown shows about 12 000

435
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,480
characters of this page fofa shows about

436
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,400
28 000.

437
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,559
and that really shows the difference

438
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,000
when you're looking for

439
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,280
um for some sort of service who's only

440
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,720
recognizable substring

441
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,280
is further down very far down on its

442
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:21,919
page

443
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,520
or does have a page with a lot of

444
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,919
characters

445
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,360
so i wasn't kidding about the quiz

446
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,080
so please uh please go on to the slack

447
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:32,720
channel

448
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,039
and um and let's start

449
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,760
scenario one a security researcher

450
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,960
believe they have found the new

451
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,240
misfortune cookie

452
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,840
and is interested in seeing all the

453
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,280
pages from all the ips that have port

454
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,440
7547

455
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,160
open in the last month which scanning

456
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,559
service would you use

457
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,679
please uh please fill out the survey

458
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,880
the the quiz and um

459
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,360
let's see

460
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,320
that's right i would use 7. because

461
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,440
rapid 7

462
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,520
gives a dump of all the data in the last

463
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,240
month it's a much better service to use

464
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,840
than all the others where you have to

465
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,799
query a specific

466
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,120
ip or have to use a lot of credits to

467
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,320
get further pay

468
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:28,160
more pages on to the next scenario

469
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,760
scenario two d-link dsl 2750b

470
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,360
has a command injection vulnerability

471
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,960
according to exploit db

472
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,559
but the device name at the is at the

473
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,000
very bottom of its login home

474
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,559
page what scanning service would you use

475
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,000
that's right i always use fosa because

476
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,760
sofa has

477
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,720
indexes more of the html data then it's

478
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,640
a much better service to use

479
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,320
and as you can see um while

480
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,320
showdown has only 63 results for this uh

481
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,080
this router census has 393

482
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,480
and fofa has 519 unique ips

483
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,799
and note that i took a span of about two

484
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,039
weeks so it's not the fact that

485
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:25,120
fofa has saved scans from the past

486
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,720
doesn't make sense and for our last

487
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,159
scenario

488
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,480
i want to find data about a specific ip

489
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,480
address because it came up as possibly

490
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,360
interesting from my company's ids

491
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:48,640
what scanning service would you use

492
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,280
well it really depends what what you're

493
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,120
comfortable with or what you like

494
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,840
i would use showdown if i'm more most

495
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,440
comfortable with that or if i want the

496
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,159
most

497
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,600
what i want to look at the most ports

498
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,600
i would use onif if i want to see this

499
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,919
if this ip for some reason

500
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,679
is has been found you in pastebin

501
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,120
i would use sofa because it's chinese

502
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,240
and might not

503
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,880
have the exclusion lists that other

504
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,120
scanning services have

505
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,440
or i would use census because i'm most

506
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,960
comfortable with that and i want to see

507
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,000
if there's any

508
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,600
interesting data that was indexed

509
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,679
i wouldn't use rapid 7 for this because

510
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,240
it's not a specific ip

511
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,440
but in conclusion

512
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,400
no scanning service is an entire toolbox

513
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,760
and i very much hope

514
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,960
that next time you find an interesting

515
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,840
ivy

516
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,520
you won't use a screwdriver to try to

517
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,159
take a nail out from a board thank you

518
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:57,840
very much
