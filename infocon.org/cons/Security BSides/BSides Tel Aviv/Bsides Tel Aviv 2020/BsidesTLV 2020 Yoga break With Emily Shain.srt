00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,359

to you we're going to start in our chair

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,640
and then we'll get

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,359

instagram or facebook all right guys so

14
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,040
i'm guessing most of you are in a chair

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,399
on your computers

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,120
so let's start sitting down in a place

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,399
where you all are comfortable we're

18
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,160
going to bring the feet directly

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,320
underneath the knees and we're going to

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,760
start to look at our feet and

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,320
spread the feet wide so look at your

22
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,079
feet make sure they're parallel to one

23
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:52,719
another

24
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,520
and try and get each one of the toes to

25
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,280
really spread wide and ground into the

26
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,160
floor

27
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,320
now as you're pressing down interlock

28
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,239
the fingers and start to stretch your

29
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,280
arms

30
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,320
all the way up and over the head

31
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,799
all right and this is our first stretch

32
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,479
today of the practice

33
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,159
what you really want to start to feel is

34
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,600
that your body

35
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,000
is pressing down at the same time that

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,600
it's lifting up so there are two

37
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,880
opposite opposite forces moving

38
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,920
you longer in both directions very good

39
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,680
now exhale let's just take a twist take

40
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,040
your left hand

41
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,520
past your right knee look back and past

42
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,439
your right shoulder

43
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,360
you can use the support of the chair

44
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,600
here your right hand to press against

45
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,479
the chair

46
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,159
to twist deeper try not to lose that

47
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,920
connection with your feet keep them

48
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,320
pressing deeply down to the floor

49
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,479
you should be able to feel your heels

50
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,840
and toes

51
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,840
digging down into the floor beneath you

52
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,079
if you take a few moments to notice your

53
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:54,880
breath so

54
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,719
inhale you'll feel your spine getting

55
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,520
longer the breath rising up and in

56
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,759
and exhale you may take a deeper twist

57
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:02,719
as you look back

58
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,159
past that right shoulder barely pulling

59
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,840
upwards and inwards chest expanding with

60
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,920
the inhale

61
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,239
go ahead and exhale just slowly release

62
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:15,840
let's do the other side so you can

63
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,239
inter lock the fingers one more time

64
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,480
pinky to the other side than before

65
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,480
and inhale as you press down again reach

66
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,239
your arms all the way up

67
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,760
if you have tension in your shoulders

68
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,599
you can always take a wider

69
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,760
press of the hands towards the sky which

70
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,440
you again want to feel is that

71
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,599
this pull is happening in two directions

72
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,760
your feet are grounding down your arms

73
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,800
are reaching up

74
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,239
we're going to take one more deep breath

75
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,640
in get an exhale just take your right

76
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,239
hand to your left knee

77
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,360
and look back past your left shoulder

78
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,680
again you support yourself with that

79
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,720
left hand

80
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,120
and find the depth in the pose that's

81
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,200
right for you

82
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,640
keep pressing through your feet and

83
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,319
lengthening for your spine

84
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,239
you don't want to crunch in or pull back

85
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,400
you really want to find the longest

86
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,400
tallest seat possible

87
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,879
expand the left lung left side of the

88
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,159
ribcage

89
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,080
with every inhalation and on the

90
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,200
exhalation

91
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,119
feel yourself twisting even deeper

92
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,760
very good slowly and gently let's

93
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,599
release so let's take a forward fold you

94
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,959
can just let yourself

95
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,519
drop down towards the floor let your

96
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:24,560
head relax

97
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,840
let your whole body melt down

98
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,440
now here i just want you to keep

99
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,840
noticing your feet so as your body is

100
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,440
relaxing is your

101
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,760
groundedness is your sense of connection

102
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,440
to the floor still strong

103
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,159
through the heels and through the toes

104
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,200
very good

105
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,440
and then slowly and gently release let's

106
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,599
begin to come all the way back up into a

107
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,159
seat

108
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,920
and let's also move off of the chair so

109
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,400
you're going to slowly help yourself out

110
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,760
and we're going to take a nice big

111
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,840
stretch here with the chair so you can

112
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,840
sort of face the chair towards you and

113
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,200
you're just going to take your hands

114
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,959
either to the top of the chair or to the

115
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,159
arms of the chair

116
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,680
you're going to send yourself back

117
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,680
you're going to take a long deep stretch

118
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,000
try and keep your legs straight if

119
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,959
possible

120
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:14,159
and keep relaxing your head down

121
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,478
again noticing your breath and noticing

122
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,639
this really nice 90 degree angle that

123
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,399
you're creating with the legs and with

124
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,639
the back

125
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,800
your head is relaxed your body is

126
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,000
relaxed

127
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
the chair is there just to give you

128
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,560
support as you stretch through your body

129
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,120
okay taking here just a few more deep

130
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,440
breaths

131
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,840
relax every part of the body that you

132
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,000
can your facial muscles

133
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,800
your throat your neck pulling back

134
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,120
through your hips

135
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,720
reaching through your fingers

136
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,479
very good and then slowly and gently

137
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,400
you'll come back up and you'll help your

138
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,000
you're going to help yourself all the

139
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,720
way back up

140
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,120
into standing let's try a forward fold

141
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,560
without the chips you're going to take

142
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,199
that

143
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,520
chair apart side and you're going to

144
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,039
take your feet apart

145
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,199
with distance all right so we can take a

146
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,639
wide stance depending on your

147
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,000
flexibility

148
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
feel free to take as wide of a distance

149
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,440
as you need you're just going to start

150
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,880
to fold forward

151
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,039
and really what you want to feel i much

152
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,880
prefer that you bend your knees like

153
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,080
this and relax

154
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,080
rather than do something like this which

155
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,000
is what we're so used to anyway

156
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,919
from working at our computers all day so

157
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,440
avoid that shape

158
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,000
just allow yourself to melt down as if

159
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
that chair is still beneath you and

160
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,240
allow your head and your hands to relax

161
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,120
and breathe here just a few more deep

162
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,440
breaths

163
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,240
when you're ready try and move slowly

164
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,600
through the spine you're going to

165
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,840
unravel the vertebrae

166
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,639
all the way back up unravel through your

167
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,639
whole back through your legs through the

168
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,199
spine

169
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,440
all the way up into a standing position

170
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,080
let's start to reach our arms up inhale

171
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,919
take a deep breath in and fill up the

172
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,600
lungs look up to the sky

173
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,039
take a deep breath in and exhale take a

174
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,680
nice

175
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,240
big forward fold and allow your head to

176
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,120
relax

177
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,600
let's do that twice more so inhale you

178
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,560
reach your arms up you expand the arms

179
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,319
up your eyes off

180
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,160
and exhale you relax your whole body

181
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,360
down

182
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,400
last time inhale a deep breath in reach

183
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,199
your arms

184
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,840
all the way up and exhale just bring

185
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,120
your hands to heart

186
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,360
center let's find ourselves here

187
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,800
breathing five deep breaths

188
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,800
maybe you can already feel your inhale

189
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,080
expanding you

190
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,919
extending the lungs the breath from

191
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,680
within

192
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,759
and the exhale just sinking you deeper

193
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:56,880
into your feet

194
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,960
into your legs into that connection with

195
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,479
the floor

196
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,880
all right so on our next inhale you can

197
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,240
open your eyes if they were closed

198
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,039
you're going to come

199
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,680
up onto the tips of the toes so if you

200
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,560
can't see my

201
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,400
feet the feet are doing something like

202
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,319
this where all the

203
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,319
toes are on the mat and just the heels

204
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,680
are up so if you have to play with

205
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,199
balance that's fine

206
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,759
take your time try and find yourself

207
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,759
holding with your thighs active your

208
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,039
knees active

209
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:29,199
your chest open let's try and hold here

210
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,400
and breathe for three

211
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,639
good four two and one exhale release and

212
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,240
release your hands down let's move into

213
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,680
a tree pose so

214
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,160
you can use your chair or a wall to find

215
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,840
balance we're gonna start by shifting

216
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,199
the weight to the left foot

217
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,240
and bring the right foot into our left

218
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,400
eye you can move your hands here to

219
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,599
heart center

220
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,879
and choose one single point of focus

221
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,000
out in front of you so that your eyes

222
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,120
your mind can rest on that point for a

223
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,520
moment

224
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,520
and just find a moment to breathe

225
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,039
in and breathe out

226
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,960
in a state of stillness silence

227
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,599
and concentration and if you ever need

228
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:18,479
to take your hand

229
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,680
out to a wall or to the chair that's

230
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,479
absolutely fine

231
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,879
anyone who feels really good here and

232
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,479
you want to go even further

233
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,960
can send your arms all the way up maybe

234
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,640
even look up towards the sky

235
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,760
so really stretching really expanding

236
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,799
everything out you want to exhale just

237
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,880
slowly release bring your hands down

238
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,080
bring that right leg down you're going

239
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,519
to switch right away

240
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,200
over to the other leg right palm of the

241
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,120
foot is down left palm of the foot will

242
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,880
move into the right thigh

243
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,680
hands will meet at heart center perhaps

244
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,279
on this side of the body

245
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,120
there's some different experience that's

246
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,720
taking place

247
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,080
again focus our eyes on one single point

248
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,760
out ahead of us and just breathe

249
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:09,839
into this body this moment

250
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,800
this chance we have to connect to our

251
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,800
breath

252
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,160
to our deeper awareness

253
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,240
take your five feet

254
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,720
anyone who feels that they can go deeper

255
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,560
will simply reach those arms

256
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,959
all the way up you'll look to the sky

257
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,880
you'll feel your heart expanding as

258
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,640
wide as possible beautiful and exhale

259
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,959
slowly release and bring your hands down

260
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,160
bring your legs down

261
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,120
and let's just shake out the body relax

262
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,080
beautiful

263
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,800
all right now our last pose for the

264
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,360
practice

265
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,640
is going to be a downward dog

266
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,640
you can use your chair if you'd like

267
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,959
similarly to how we did in the beginning

268
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,480
especially if you're a beginner i really

269
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,480
just recommend grabbing the base of the

270
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,160
chair sending yourself back

271
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,000
and moving into a position that's like

272
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,640
this if you're ready to move into on the

273
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,640
ground you'll just bring your hands down

274
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,480
your hips will be up high

275
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,320
and you'll stretch your body back

276
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,720
okay you're gonna try and hold here for

277
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,600
about

278
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,800
five to ten breaths really your whole

279
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,480
body is creating this nice

280
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,760
triangle shape your hips are the tip of

281
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,279
that triangle your

282
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,959
sitting bones are the hips that are the

283
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,399
tips of the triangle

284
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,839
and your hands and your feet are

285
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,560
grounding down

286
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,800
good let's all take just one more breath

287
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,640
here

288
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,720
very good and slowly release you're

289
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,399
going to come all the way down

290
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,120
back into a seated position now we'll

291
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,560
we'll close the practice with our

292
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,959
restorative pose so what does that mean

293
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,200
you can move back towards your chair and

294
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,720
you're going to bring your knees

295
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,120
up to your chair as your body lies down

296
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,240
so i'll just

297
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,640
readjust the computer there for a moment

298
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,240
you can see the mat

299
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,120
perfect all right so it will look like

300
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,920
this you're going to lay your body down

301
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,519
you're going to bring your knees to the

302
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,360
tip of the chair

303
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,320
and your feet can just rest against the

304
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,920
back of the chair here

305
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,320
okay you're going to gently and slowly

306
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,040
guide your whole body down to the floor

307
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,200
and allow your arms to sprawl that way

308
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,480
to the sides or rest

309
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,000
on your belly

310
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,680
i'm going to close the practice here

311
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,680
with a final minute

312
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:43,839
of restorative deep breathing

313
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,000
as you breathe if you notice that the

314
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,160
body is still eager to

315
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,839
kick some movement you can always

316
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,519
stretch your right leg up a little bit

317
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,760
higher to the sky

318
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,839
and release and switch next

319
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,600
you can do that as often or as little as

320
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:11,839
you'd like

321
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,920
when you feel ready to just allow the

322
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,360
body to relax

323
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:25,519
and let go we'll lay all the way down

324
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,279
taking here just a few more breaths

325
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,519
hugging the knees into the chest when

326
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:39,839
you're ready

327
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,000
and then whenever you're ready just

328
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,079
slowly releasing your hands releasing

329
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,200
your legs

330
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,040
and helping yourself come all the way

331
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,160
back up into a seat on the floor

332
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,320

333
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,600
today i hope you

334
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,600
take these breaks quite often to move

335
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,600
your body to breathe and to feel

336
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,880

337
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,760
