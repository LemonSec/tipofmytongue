for the opportunity to talk about the

25
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,140
CCI League the first global community

26
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,750
dedicated to neutralize in cyber threats

27
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,580
looking to exploit the current pandemic

28
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,570
and to protect life-saving sector so

29
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,700
Karen told a lot of about me but I want

30
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,920
to introduce myself in person as you

31
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,290
heard my name is Eisenberg I'm the

32
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,420
founder of the city Ally I'm leaving Tel

33
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,280
Aviv here five minutes away from this

34
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,680
place and everything that's already

35
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,700
strapped so let's start the story of the

36
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,380
city I League four five six months ago

37
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,770
on January when general I started to see

38
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,110
more and more threat actors trying to

39
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,439
leverage the current crisis to input for

40
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,560
example the team of the corner into the

41
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,750
decoy documents all the documents the

42
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,270
trying to leverage in some social

43
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,149
engineering methods in order to attack

44
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:58,229
some clients and victims and on January

45
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:00,689
when it was just a small virus an

46
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:03,090
unknown virus in China I started to see

47
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,270
more and more threat actors use it then

48
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,590
I saw an increasing of that on mouch I

49
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:12,120
started to think what would happen if

50
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,680
some occurs

51
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,980
try to reply the scenario of not petia

52
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,700
from 2017 the time that ransom were

53
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,099
targeted hospitals in the US and around

54
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:26,280
the world this is a real danger this is

55
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,200
now note that this is not the time to do

56
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,379
it this is a real threat now that might

57
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:34,859
causing death the bass the equation that

58
00:02:34,859 --> 00:02:37,349
I do is very simple if some Hospital

59
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:39,480
need to choose between pain to

60
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,799
ransomware or Bank new ventilator I

61
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:45,720
prefer that this hospital will buy this

62
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,670
new ventilator so I started to think how

63
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,370
can I contribute to this effort because

64
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,709
I can't I'm not a doctor I can't fight

65
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:59,159
the virus itself but I can contribute

66
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:02,069
and participate in the fight of the

67
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:04,739
world of the virus I can help to protect

68
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:06,299
life-saving sectors

69
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:09,000
I remember a really long denied drive

70
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,780
that I add to Tel Aviv just after the

71
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,909
Prime Minister of Israel announced about

72
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:18,629
the quantum and I said to myself you are

73
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:20,099
going to have a lot of spare time right

74
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:23,609
now you are going to stay at home for at

75
00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:26,099
least one or two months you need to do

76
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:29,340
something for the medical sector I

77
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,579
thought about a slack channel some small

78
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:35,519
slack channel 450 maximum people that's

79
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,620
going to answer some scripts on Jordan

80
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,319
to identify vulnerabilities but only a

81
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,590
few days after the second biggest shaker

82
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,159
public hospital was targeted and heated

83
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:49,500
by a cyber attack that was the trigger

84
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,650
that said to me you need to do something

85
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,099
now that was the trigger for me to stop

86
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:59,040
sitting on the fence and start operating

87
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,159
death City Island I reached Nate

88
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,799
Warfield is one of my co-founder because

89
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,659
it witted a lot of ease effort to

90
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:08,819
identifying vulnerabilities in medical

91
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:11,400
organizations I sent him a message and I

92
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,010
said hi I'm in the last few days I think

93
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,430
about creating the poor bond of CGI

94
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:19,199
community dedicated to the current

95
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,810
crisis like a strep channel do one hour

96
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:22,320
join me

97
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,349
so together alongside with Mark holders

98
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:26,790
and Chris miles and all

99
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,830
the management team of city eyelid we

100
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:32,340
established the first global community

101
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,310
dedicated will become on crisis I want

102
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,780
to start talking about the city ilyich

103
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:40,230
itself with this map this map does not

104
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,660
presenting the distribution of the virus

105
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,960
of corner this map includes all the

106
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,180
countries that we have volunteers form

107
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,020
from New Zealand to Australia Japan

108
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,000
India the Middle East Europe South

109
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,860
Africa and other countries in Africa

110
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,710
northern South America people joined us

111
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:02,730
for more than 1500 people from all

112
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,710
around the world more than 80 countries

113
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:08,550
in 21 time zones it means that every

114
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,830
time in the league we have at least one

115
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:14,240
member that is active and ready to act

116
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,970
so we started the city a league as

117
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:22,830
global the CIL also is a community it

118
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,690
means that we want to connect people

119
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:28,080
want to build the social network but

120
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,900
professional network of people that want

121
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,330
to volunteer to want to contribute poor

122
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:37,260
bono to some great goal we want to make

123
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,960
change but we really care about what

124
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,300
people wear the members of the city I

125
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,280
League think about our daily should

126
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,730
operate we are a community of cyber

127
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,040
threat intelligence experts incident

128
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,370
responders industry experts and are

129
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:56,250
really happy about the fact that we have

130
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,770
a lot of law-enforcement organization

131
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:01,560
and representative in the community

132
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,730
these connections is very very very very

133
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:08,070
important to the league because together

134
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:11,070
we can break the silos and the barriers

135
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,380
between people all around the world no

136
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,910
matter the country no matter the place

137
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:17,910
we can connect them and operate is one

138
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,730
unit to make the change this is the

139
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:23,040
first time law enforcement organizations

140
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,690
from all around the world whether it's

141
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:27,900
government in organization agencies or

142
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,770
national cells can talk directly with

143
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:33,810
experts not from only from the country

144
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:38,100
from all around the world on that those

145
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,729
are the missions of the city I lead

146
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:42,710
the first mission in the most paralyzing

147
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,020
the most initial mission of the city

148
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,569
eyelid is to neutralize cyber threats

149
00:06:47,569 --> 00:06:50,569
looking to exploit the current covenant

150
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:53,779
in pandemic the second mission of the

151
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:56,180
city eyelid is to protect life-saving

152
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,909
sectors from cyber attack by life-saving

153
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:00,979
sectors I mean the medical sector the

154
00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:02,960
public health sector the emergency

155
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,449
sector of all the people that now

156
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:08,029
fighting the virus standing on the field

157
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:09,620
on the frontline of the virus and

158
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,770
someone need to watch them - if we can

159
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:15,110
contribute and help them protecting

160
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:18,289
their network the organization's they

161
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:21,349
will be able to save life more than

162
00:07:21,349 --> 00:07:25,159
painful antemer and the last mission and

163
00:07:25,159 --> 00:07:26,599
I'm going to talk about it in a few

164
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:28,699
minutes is to support the law

165
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:30,919
enforcement organization against the

166
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:33,499
cyber threats that are a danger for the

167
00:07:33,499 --> 00:07:37,699
public safety to understand how we

168
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:40,520
achieve this mission of these missions

169
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,580
I'm going to talk about four main core

170
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,770
services of the city eyelid

171
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,959
all of these services are pro bono

172
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:48,830
services

173
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:51,469
none of the city I look volunteers

174
00:07:51,469 --> 00:07:54,800
getting money from it we don't ask money

175
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,620
from the organization we do it because

176
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,860
we believe that we can make change we do

177
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,979
it because we saw already our effective

178
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:06,379
can we be how fast we can walk faster

179
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:09,620
than any company in the world because we

180
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,839
are united we have representative of all

181
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:14,809
the great companies that exist in the

182
00:08:14,809 --> 00:08:17,839
world and we're looking for more so

183
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,339
let's talk about the core services of

184
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:20,240
the city I live

185
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,110
the first one is neutralization we can

186
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:26,659
compare neutralization to getting a

187
00:08:26,659 --> 00:08:29,680
vaccine or using a medicine for disease

188
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,029
transaction means neutralized malicious

189
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:34,940
activity exploiting the current covenant

190
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,578
in pandemic or targeting the life-saving

191
00:08:37,578 --> 00:08:39,620
sectors which are the medical the

192
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,779
emergency the Public Health and we do

193
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:45,290
that by three main services or efforts

194
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:48,230
the first one is takedown we want to

195
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,740
terminate or to eliminate the

196
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,630
infrastructure and the assets of the

197
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,000
trash

198
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,640
Actos from the internet we were able to

199
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,360
do it and we did it with amazing amount

200
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,760
of tear downs

201
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,260
for sure at the last few months of the

202
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,950
CGI League we were able to take down and

203
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,460
remove from the internet a lot of stress

204
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:14,040
we can try out the information to the

205
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,440
medical sector for example or to the

206
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,560
organization that were impersonated we

207
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,780
can escalate with the information to

208
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,300
further investigation of these law

209
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,660
enforcement organization we believe if

210
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:31,100
we will take down these threat actors

211
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,420
infrastructure we will be able to

212
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,300
disrupt their ability to conduct the

213
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,060
criminal activities we will be able to

214
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,160
make a safer place for the medical

215
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,140
sector but this is not enough because

216
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,600
you can't take down all the malicious

217
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,940
infrastructures from the internet we

218
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,920
need something else we need something

219
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,610
more than vaccine so we have prevention

220
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:56,250
if we talked about neutralization on the

221
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,290
terms of the medical sector as I've seen

222
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,450
we have the prevention which is met

223
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,430
wearing a mask

224
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:04,350
basically the prevention is reduced the

225
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:08,730
level of threat for our stakeholders on

226
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:11,130
that matter we are identifying

227
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:13,350
vulnerabilities compromised assets in

228
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,720
the GMAT and illegitimate ways including

229
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,870
the darkness definitely data leaks all

230
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:22,350
of these very very important knowledge

231
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:24,660
about the infrastructure all the

232
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,730
vulnerabilities that the actors can

233
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,160
exploit to do harm for these

234
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,200
organizations and we can create a

235
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,170
databases of viruses or it these great

236
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:36,480
actors that focusing on the medical

237
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,360
sector for example and to share it with

238
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,640
the organizations with the Caesars of

239
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,140
the organization and its really

240
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,240
important to us to send the information

241
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,270
to send it indicators for example the

242
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:51,420
way that the organization can posted the

243
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,820
data we made a survey at the beginning

244
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,770
of this crisis with many seasons of

245
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:58,080
hospitals all around the world part of

246
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,170
them said we can't integrate me miss

247
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:04,620
poor stakes or even open city I you can

248
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,410
send us block list so we created the

249
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:07,920
Geeta

250
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,500
dedicated for them we can escalate

251
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,320
information - LT sucks for example all

252
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,170
around the world and then we'll reach

253
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,149
the organization said hey you have

254
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:20,430
vulnerabilities please touch it but it

255
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,649
festers you can reduce the level of

256
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:25,380
threat to your organization in some

257
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,170
cases the vulnerabilities will so severe

258
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:31,199
that we needed to outreach the specific

259
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:33,269
organization by phone and say them

260
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:34,230
please

261
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,209
patch it now this is a real threat for

262
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:39,029
you we can share with them compromised

263
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:43,230
assets threats for these sectors trends

264
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:46,019
that exist in cyber domain and threaten

265
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:48,000
about them so we have the

266
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,560
internalization where the prevention

267
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,220
let's talk about supporting supporting

268
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:55,230
slack going to the doctor the city a

269
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,930
league wish to offer for the medical

270
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,870
sector and all the life-saving

271
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:03,420
organizations support with cyber

272
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,360
protection capabilities want to improve

273
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,699
their cyber protection capabilities want

274
00:12:08,699 --> 00:12:11,010
to guide them and to supply technical

275
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:13,500
advisors how to become a protected

276
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,870
organization we want to help them with

277
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:18,449
infrastructure support to mitigate cyber

278
00:12:18,449 --> 00:12:20,370
attacks and data leak against them I

279
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:23,699
never thought about that alex is threat

280
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:27,180
for the medical sector but after all the

281
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,829
amazing therefore that our darknet

282
00:12:28,829 --> 00:12:33,620
indeed we saw how many data medical data

283
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:38,459
sensitive data exists for selling and of

284
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:40,949
course want to offer our services if

285
00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:44,850
needed but this is not enough we can't

286
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:47,640
focus only on the life-saving sectors if

287
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,790
we want to make change now during this

288
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:54,050
crisis we need to do some other services

289
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:58,019
just related to the corner but not

290
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:00,360
related only for the life-saving sector

291
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,550
and I want to mention two of these

292
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:06,569
efforts one is this information we have

293
00:13:06,569 --> 00:13:09,839
amazing amazing amazing this enformation

294
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,560
walk up that walk 24/7 news of amazing

295
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,290
CGI tools to help preventing

296
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:19,500
health-related down it can be boxing

297
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,700
denials it

298
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,850
be fake news operation against the

299
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:27,390
corner against some rules for example of

300
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,810
the government to undermine the

301
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,510
importance of these rules this is very

302
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:36,270
dangerous because on that we can see

303
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,400
more and more people not listening to

304
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,340
the walls and then we can say we can

305
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:45,000
suffer second wave they escalate

306
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,040
information they take it down they

307
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,080
alerted the specific organization in

308
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,890
need and they use social media output

309
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:56,190
influencer to help them this group this

310
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:58,800
war group wish to help the medical

311
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,630
facilities and organization to build

312
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,880
cyber resilience against disinformation

313
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,300
attacks I want to mention another

314
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,010
health-related support that we supply as

315
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:11,040
the city I League is the L eat the law

316
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,050
enforcement collaboration want to

317
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,610
neutralize cyber threats looking to

318
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:16,500
exploit the can pandemic I studied some

319
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,440
I said it a few times here let's take an

320
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,120
example imagine with me what would

321
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,590
happen if someone who maybe not believe

322
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:28,290
in the government for example because of

323
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:30,600
a disinformation campaign we'll find an

324
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,220
ad on the darknet about test for the

325
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:38,250
koala crisis he has the symptoms he

326
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,630
wants to do a tested on it doesn't

327
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,190
believe food to the government you use

328
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,440
the test the t-bolt on the darknet

329
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,830
and then get a negative result is thick

330
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:49,590
but is get a negative result what would

331
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:52,140
happen is going to go out and infect

332
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:55,440
others it can cause second wave can

333
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,450
cause dead wave on the mat of that and

334
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:01,410
it can cause that people can die and we

335
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:03,600
need to protect them we need to help the

336
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,210
law enforcement organization all around

337
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:08,460
the world to mitigate these type of

338
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:13,140
scams we want to help them basically to

339
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,060
reduce the danger for the public safety

340
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:19,770
and of course now we suffer the corona

341
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:22,710
crisis this is a global event but in the

342
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:26,370
future we might suffer more events may

343
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:29,340
be not only health-related and we want

344
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:33,090
to be ready to protect and to help the

345
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:34,350
law enforcement organization

346
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,320
with new events global events my touch

347
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,970
crisis when protect them help the

348
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:44,340
threats for the wall on that matter I

349
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:47,070
want to thank all the law enforcement

350
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,150
organization that worked with us

351
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:51,210
including Christopher Krebs that point

352
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:54,630
out the good collaborations with the CGI

353
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,050
leagues

354
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,850
Christopher Krebs is the head of Caesar

355
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:00,990
from the DHS and all of these members of

356
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:03,750
the city I like that he'll so much for

357
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,990
the medical sector so if I look to the

358
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:08,850
future do you remember the equation that

359
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,680
I did at the beginning of this talk I

360
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,590
made that I said the treatment fell that

361
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:16,680
the organization will buy ventilators

362
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,840
for example and not paying for a ransom

363
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:22,620
oh god this is to not only now during a

364
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:27,060
crisis this is true for all the time so

365
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:30,450
we would like to stay to keep the CTI

366
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:33,630
League for the future in three months

367
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,190
and a half in almost four months of

368
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:38,460
operating the city I live Paul bond not

369
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:41,850
getting even a single dollar foiled we

370
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:44,400
saw a vulnerable the life-saving sectors

371
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:48,030
are and how many threats exist only for

372
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:50,820
them I couldn't believe it myself you

373
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,410
remember that I said beginning of this

374
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:55,530
talk that I thought it going to be 50

375
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:57,360
people and only finding vulnerabilities

376
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,880
there are so many threats so we would

377
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,370
like to build some model of an open cell

378
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:04,470
still community volunteer laid still

379
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:07,319
nonprofit still global still life-saving

380
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:10,319
sector focused and ready for the next

381
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,699
event whether it's medical or

382
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:14,760
