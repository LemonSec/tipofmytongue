1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,970
so what did we have during this day we

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:06,560
had an amazing viewership of more than

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,590
4,000 viewers from all over the world we

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,370
had 16 awesome speakers here on stage

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,180
and remotely panelists from our own team

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,220
and speakers that have been here for the

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,500
first time speakers that are rockstars

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,080
and coming back to help us out we had an

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,480
incredible mix of people from all over

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,390
Israel but also from Europe and from

11
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,149
North America and we are so thankful to

12
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:35,520
all of our amazing speakers at the end

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,170
of the day this is the content that our

14
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,649
community connects with each other to to

15
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:42,780
learn about and it's really what makes

16
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,629
this event possible we had more than

17
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:49,980
7,000 conversations going on on slack in

18
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,199
fact we're almost at the limit where

19
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:57,109
we're taking advantage of our free slack

20
00:00:57,109 --> 00:00:58,949
subscription I guess that's what you

21
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:00,809
call it that's right so we had amazing

22
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:02,820
conversations going on not just today

23
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,188
but actually starting already a week ago

24
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:07,680
with the CTF that got a lot of people on

25
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,720
line and talking and we're really really

26
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,750
proud to bring into a reality what

27
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,090
besides as a community is all about

28
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,299
expanding the boundaries of the

29
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:20,340
conversation and making the conversation

30
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,280
happen in all sorts of formats and

31
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,130
events all sorts of ways and this is

32
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,170
really an exciting opportunity for us

33
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,450
here in tel-aviv to show the world what

34
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,189
we are capable of doing what we're

35
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:34,799
capable to bring in for everybody not

36
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,509
just to the tel-aviv community that has

37
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:37,950

50
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,440
conversation we

51
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,670

52
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,790
booming or bombing or whatever you want

53
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:23,220
to call it I don't want to hear about it

54
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,250
I don't want besides to be involved with

55
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,350

180
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,780
hackers health I think now more than

181
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,880
ever the topic of mental health and

182
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,890
well-being is very very important to all

183
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:11,320
of us and with that I also want to

184
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,270
remind you it's important because we're

185
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:16,270
home but we're not alone home is the new

186
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:19,210
office yes but we are more connected

187
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:22,150
than we ever were through events like

188
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,460
this through communities like besides

189
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:27,220
and DEF CON and cyber ladies and a us

190
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,650
and all of the many other organizations

191
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,480
that have worked with hackers and

192
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,849
supported hackers wherever they are yes

193
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:36,280
we're doing more through the internet or

194
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,860
hugging our devices because we don't

195
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,349
have anybody maybe near us to hug right

196
00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:44,440
now and I know we could all use an extra

197
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,410
hug and hugging your iPad isn't quite

198
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:50,620
there yet but you're not alone even if

199
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,330
you're on the other side of the screen

200
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,209
let

201
00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:55,970
event be an opportunity for you like we

202
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,279
talked about all for Al today for a

203
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:01,369
change of pace for a reflection for an

204
00:09:01,369 --> 00:09:04,459
adaptation for a renaissance rebirth

205
00:09:04,459 --> 00:09:06,649
let's take this opportunity as the great

206
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:09,589
reset for how we do things how we live

207
00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:12,290
how we work and let's take time for

208
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,869
ourselves that's why we included a yoga

209
00:09:14,869 --> 00:09:16,939
session throughout the day I absolutely

210
00:09:16,939 --> 00:09:20,899
recommend you go visit Emilie yoga with

211
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:22,759
Emily my personal yoga teacher and a

212
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:25,429
fantastic instructor on zoom' yes you

213
00:09:25,429 --> 00:09:27,920

214
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,689

215
00:09:29,689 --> 00:09:32,720
is doing right now I just did that a few

216
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,670
days ago and I was not able to do that

217
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:37,189
when this pandemic started so at least

218
00:09:37,189 --> 00:09:38,990
that's something that you get out of

219
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,449
practicing zoom a lot have a houseplant

220
00:09:41,449 --> 00:09:44,119
we have these houseplants right here

221
00:09:44,119 --> 00:09:46,910
that are going to be our speaker gifts I

222
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,980
enjoy taking care of my houseplants

223
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,499
that's one thing that actually actually

224
00:09:51,499 --> 00:09:53,569
gives you some comfort during this very

225
00:09:53,569 --> 00:09:56,149
very difficult time and I'm very very

226
00:09:56,149 --> 00:09:57,889
thankful that we have this opportunity

227
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:01,040
to share our point of view my point of

228
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,749
view and my team's point of view about

229
00:10:02,749 --> 00:10:05,420
this crisis and how we can make the most

230
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:09,139
out of it so with that in mind I'm going

231
