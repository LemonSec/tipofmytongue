1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,560
we're ready to invite to the stage

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,480
you'll see sassy and dora meet let's

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,600
give him a warm welcome

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,759
[Applause]

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,480
right hello everybody very good to be

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:14,960
back

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,800
in the afternoon together with my friend

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,400
and colleague co-founder of channel

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,279
security

10
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,640
amit hi so uh today we're going to speak

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,279
with you

12
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,400
briefly but very much to the point

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,400
about the myths behind the command and

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,080
control server command control

15
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,440
channel and from our own personal

16
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,120
experience as red teamers in four

17
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,360
continents around the world

18
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,559
and show you uh what we really think

19
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,160
about this as an approach

20
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,280
so the problem begins uh with the

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,079
perception or or rather lack of it as

22
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:50,879
you know

23
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,120
in this game breaches are inevitable any

24
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,559
organization will be hacked given

25
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,079
motivation and time

26
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,760
and the perception of many organizations

27
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,760
especially that invest in seven figures

28
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,399
etc

29
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,039
or more is that they have this gate and

30
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,640
they have the gatekeepers and they're

31
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,360
all

32
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,280
protected and that's a nice illusion but

33
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,400
in reality

34
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,080
when we come into an organization

35
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,159
whether it's it's a state

36
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,640
agency or or a financial customer or

37
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,720
whatever or a huge telecom

38
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,920
or a small company we always see this

39
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,840
reality there is a gate but there is

40
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,920
uh things that we find that we can

41
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,520
bypass the gate around it so this is the

42
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,880
real reality we live in

43
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,799
and of course there is the known axiom

44
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,240
that defenders

45
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,040
uh the blue team's really in

46
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,799
generalizing of course but they think

47
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,680
normally in lists they just check boxes

48
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,159
that's how the tools are built the ui is

49
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,600
is even

50
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,360
matching the mindset while us you know

51
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,439
attackers adversaries we think in graphs

52
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,040
we move laterally

53
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,600
and we can find the right path shortest

54
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,479
path to

55
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,439
success so with that said uh let's talk

56
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,320
about this myth

57
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,040
uh you obviously need the tcp connection

58
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,040
for a command control server right

59
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,040
i mean udp tcp or socket whatever

60
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,560
not so sure your c you think the

61
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,239
perimeter is enough

62
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,360
to stop a connection to a remote target

63
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,760
what what what are you saying you mean

64
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,160
do we need a tcp connection for cnc

65
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,720
server i don't think so

66
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,879
can you explain what what do you mean

67
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,000
well i think there are many

68
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,760
methods and their assumption that we

69
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,360
need an active connection to the

70
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,640
endpoint in order to gain

71
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,480
command and control but today we're

72
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,239
going to see some proof that it's not

73
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,840
always the case

74
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,160
all right so you say it's not about an

75
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,800
established connection north tcp nor udp

76
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,280
or whatever uh basically what you're

77
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,160
saying it's a mindset

78
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,280
just a mindset exactly okay i hear you

79
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,640
and and i raise with uh

80
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,000
yeah sure so let's take an example what

81
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,560
do we know

82
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,280
as an asynchronous mechanism store on

83
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,080
ford of course

84
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,920
email smtp what about your email client

85
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,640
can outlook really go wrong you and

86
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,599
serve as a command control channel

87
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,560
it is okay so let's give it a shot so we

88
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,640
did give it a shot

89
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,959
and uh we are now we look at the machine

90
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:11,680
this machine

91
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,760
uh that you see here in the demo has a

92
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,720
folder c

93
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,920
temp x fill and there are a bunch of uh

94
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,200
documents here but we wanted the

95
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,080
documents

96
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,080
of a project called project x we want to

97
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,519
execute it from the machine

98
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,120
and we have an outlook account as you

99
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,959
can see this

100
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,720
outlook is connected to a gmail account

101
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,760
the sent mail the sent items

102
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,360
is are blank it doesn't have anything

103
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,599
there and just two items in the inbox

104
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:38,720
what we're going to do now is we're

105
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,200
going to infect the machine with the

106
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,280
a small payload that i prepared in

107
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,959
advance

108
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,560
and i'm going to show the payload in a

109
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,159
second but then i'm going to show you

110
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,920
how i'm going to attack this machine all

111
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,560
i do to

112
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,879
attack this machine once i infected it

113
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,959
is simply send it an email message

114
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,560
so somewhere from the world somewhere

115
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,879
from the internet from any mail provider

116
00:03:58,879 --> 00:03:59,280
that

117
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,280
i choose i'm just sending uh a message

118
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,760
but pay attention then in a body i'm

119
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,760
looking recursively for all the files

120
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,959
that match product

121
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,000
project x and i'm asking that to be the

122
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,480
result

123
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,840
of of this payload and i'm simply

124
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,519
sending an email message from somewhere

125
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,880
in the internet

126
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,358
and i'll switch back to our outlook

127
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:22,000
client

128
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,759
i deliberately delayed it a bit so

129
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:24,800
you'll see what's happening pay

130
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,800
attention that yeah you see for a second

131
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,240
my machine my message

132
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,720
and wow i'm shocked yeah can you believe

133
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,680
it it's magic

134
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,840
and now it's gone not only the message

135
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,880
in the inbox is gone

136
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,600
also the sent item the proof for

137
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,000
something that was sent is also deleted

138
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,520
and if we come back to our attacker

139
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,280
machine our attacker email client from

140
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,120
the internet you can see the

141
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,400
exfiltrated document so essentially we

142
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,560
got the document out and and the

143
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,280
uh machine basically attacked itself

144
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:55,759
from an

145
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,080
asynchronous method with a day-to-day

146
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,720
tool such as an auto client

147
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,680
amazing and and here you can see the the

148
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,360
loop it's it's a very simple loop it's

149
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,039
living off the land as always we love

150
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,160
living off the land

151
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,520
we don't want to introduce

152
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,039
too much complicated stuff when we don't

153
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,880
need to it's just the simple

154
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,280
outlook object model we're running a

155
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,000
simple

156
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,840
loop when we are looking at the sender

157
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,280
if the sender is the one that

158
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,880
we are looking for we just invoke

159
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,080
expression that's a simple partial code

160
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,199
then we create the message we attach uh

161
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,479
the results coming back and after a

162
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,240
couple of seconds we also

163
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,000
after we see that the message was sent

164
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,360
we also delete

165
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,639
the message from the uh sent items

166
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,560
um so other places we can look at

167
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,800
um what about the audit logs there are

168
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,240
so many of them right

169
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,759
i mean they're just collecting a bunch

170
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,400
of stuff we use them for reconnaissance

171
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,800
naturally we do but what can we do

172
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,240
something else about them

173
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,080
i think yes you'll see first your demo

174
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,759
was really really impressive

175
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,919
and what i realized just now after

176
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,520
seeing it for the first time

177
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,759
yeah is that this technique and other

178
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:06,639
techniques

179
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,919
usually involving um the initiation

180
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,080
of um connection to the endpoint that we

181
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,199
want to get

182
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,520
um control over right right i need a

183
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,800
connection somehow

184
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,120
yeah it could be a reverse shell http

185
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,000
using application

186
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,039
layer like http dns maybe a raw tcp

187
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,199
socket but eventually if we have a

188
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,880
perimeter control this is at least the

189
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,639
assumption in most places right like a

190
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,960
firewall or other filtering mechanism

191
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,319
it's going to block the connection and

192
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,080
if we have like a firewall rules

193
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,720
that deny all inbound or outbound

194
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,520
connection

195
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,880
we're going to have a problem even with

196
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,880
this amazing technique right

197
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,360
right so i'm wondering if you mentioned

198
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,680
firewall so if i'm going to

199
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,280
if there is a firewall with deny all

200
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,280
incoming even denial outgoing

201
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,639
to this machine can you do something

202
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,479
about that i think we can

203
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,639
okay what if we could let's talk about

204
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,680
the idea first before we see a nice demo

205
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,199
and what if you could take the payload

206
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,599
that we want to transfer convert it into

207
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,520
a byte array and then use this byte

208
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,000
array to spoof a list of ip addresses

209
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,120
and then address

210
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,039
this endpoint this target with this list

211
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,560
of spoofed ip addresses

212
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,840
the connection of course going to be

213
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,280
dropped because the firewall configured

214
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,160
to deny all

215
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,400
connection right all inbound connection

216
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,440
but

217
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,280
it's going to have this spoofed ip

218
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,560
address that contain

219
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,280
the converted payload inside the log so

220
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,960
i think it sounds complicated i think i

221
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,599
need to see it

222
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,599
you need to see a demo yeah right if you

223
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:28,800
will

224
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,199
okay just because you asked thank you

225
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,080
okay

226
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,599
so is it playing uh no

227
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,400
no okay great so what we're going to see

228
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,919
now is the target machine and we're

229
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:40,560
going to

230
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,639
witness that the firewall indeed have a

231
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,479
deny all inbound connection

232
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:45,840
and trust me it also have for the

233
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,599
outbound rules as well

234
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,080
okay we can see some demonstration of

235
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,280
the log files

236
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,280
okay and see that we have a block

237
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,679
traffic

238
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,520
open sesame okay and here we have a drop

239
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,039
udp connection and soon enough we're

240
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,000
going to test it

241
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,560
in a live in within a icmp request with

242
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,840
a ping request from a different

243
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,879
workstation

244
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,720
here i enabled as well the gpo mechanism

245
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,639
for auditing data in the event log which

246
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,520
is the audit filtering platform

247
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,560
only for failure events that's enough

248
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,080
so let's do a ping to this target

249
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,840
machine and see what happened

250
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,800
okay all right i'm a bit scared what's

251
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,360
gonna happen

252
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,199
i'm scared as well nothing working

253
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,720
at least you're here so i'm not too

254
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,399
scared oh okay thanks

255
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,880
okay let's go back to our target machine

256
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,279
and see what happened

257
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,080
so actually the auditing in the log file

258
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,279
you're going to have a little bit of a

259
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,000
delay

260
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,440
because of the mechanism windows

261
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,120
firewalls working but if we go to the

262
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,920
event log

263
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,480
in just a second okay refresh it and

264
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,320
then we can see a lot of audit failure

265
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,120
events

266
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,200
and as you can see we have as the source

267
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,959
address my address this is the target

268
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:57,680
address

269
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,959
and the destination port and protocol is

270
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:01,839
one which is

271
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,720
sent for the icmp okay we can see indeed

272
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,640
it was blocked and when we go again

273
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,800
to the file log we can see here we have

274
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,720
a dropped icmp connection

275
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,480
so the firewall indeed block all the

276
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,640
connection all the inbound connections

277
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,760
all right so what we can do now we first

278
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,959
clear the log so

279
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,040
when we establish our method we can see

280
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,080
it more clearly

281
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,720
without the noise okay we go back

282
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,240
to the source machine and over here

283
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,760
i'm going to run a command we're going

284
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,120
to see it soon on the screen and then

285
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,640
i'm going to stop the video for

286
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,320
just short period of time and explain

287
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,399
what we're going to witness

288
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,320
okay is that some kind of a crafted

289
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,200
packet or

290
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,959
exactly so what we're going to do now

291
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,200
it's actually the following thing

292
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,320
we're going to take the following

293
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,720
command which is a powerful command

294
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,120
okay get date which will give us the

295
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,080
current date

296
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,800
and put it and write it into a file okay

297
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,920
into a text file

298
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,160
inside of the directory of c temp and

299
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:00,959
the rest of

300
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,440
the text that you see over here okay if

301
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,079
the

302
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,399
file is not existing it will be created

303
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,839
because we have the force

304
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,040
parameter okay and this command is going

305
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,880
to be converted into a byte array and

306
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,040
then to the spoofed ip list

307
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,600
okay and then the agent that i already

308
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,480
pre-installed

309
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,399
on the target gonna take it convert it

310
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,760
back into the text

311
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,519
and invoke it using powershell

312
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,200
interpreter okay

313
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,880
now we have a little bit of a problem

314
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,800
because if we send a lot of

315
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,720
raw data like this a lot of spoofed ip

316
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,880
addresses how can i recognize that we

317
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,600
reach to the

318
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,760
end of the payload and we don't when we

319
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,040
don't just having

320
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,839
additional ip address that comes from

321
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,160
some connections over all the place

322
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,519
what do you think you see what we need

323
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,120
to do yeah i think there's a problem

324
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,880
here because it needs to be sequential

325
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,640
right even that you send those bytes and

326
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,519
as spoofed

327
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,680
source addresses you still need some

328
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,200
signaling mechanism right

329
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,079
yeah i think you you you probably did

330
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,600
you do that already or

331
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,079
yeah i did you did yeah i did you see it

332
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:01,120
you see yeah yeah

333
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,120
you'll see i thought about it advanced

334
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,640
yeah okay i think about stuff

335
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,120
yeah yeah lucky me so we have here the

336
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,680
magic

337
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,760
end packet so what is the exactly magic

338
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,320
end packet this is a special crafted ip

339
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,040
address

340
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,440
which will be 55.55.55.55 this is

341
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,680
just a um random ip address that i chose

342
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,440
and this is going to signal my agent on

343
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,720
the target

344
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,399
that this is the end of the payload and

345
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,920
you need to take all the spoofed

346
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,760
messages until this

347
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,720
exactly event and then convert it to the

348
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,480
payload and run it

349
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,720
so let's go back we just initiated the

350
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,160
command

351
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,839
let's go back to my target machine and

352
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,440
see what happens so as you can see my

353
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,000
temp folder

354
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,880
is now empty it's got nothing inside it

355
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,519
but

356
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,760
we got all the messages and coc we got

357
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,680
here all the spoofed ip addresses

358
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,839
which has a benefit on its own because

359
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,839
right now if someone will investigate

360
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,839
this thing you won't be able to know

361
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,839
whether it's just a random ip address or

362
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,519
not and here the file was created

363
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,200
and that's the magic and here is the

364
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,120
magic end packet exactly

365
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,920
now wait wait before you continue i want

366
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,959
to mention something

367
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,279
you see the source port the destination

368
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,200
port are zero and the protocol set to

369
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:11,839
six

370
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,760
this is the convention that tells my

371
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,519
agent inside of the target

372
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,399
that all of the ip addresses okay that

373
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,240
initiated connection with this pattern

374
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,600
with this convention

375
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,839
are belonging to the same payload so in

376
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:24,720
addition

377
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,120
to my magic end packet okay that we see

378
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,839
over here

379
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,360
we have for all the packets the same

380
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,519
pattern so we can get them together

381
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,519
inside the original payload so basically

382
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,880
not only did we

383
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,680
spoof who we are we spoofed the identity

384
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,000
of the

385
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,480
attacker we also get the payload

386
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,279
executed

387
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,079
just by dropping so by the defenders are

388
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,600
basically attacking themselves

389
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,680
exactly and as you can see or see we got

390
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,639
the log file

391
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,120
that was created with the date inside

392
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,000
with the current date

393
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,839
and what can you learn from this

394
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,200
information you see

395
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,120
i see it's one a.m

396
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,720
which means i need more sleep than i

397
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,399
need more sleep need a vacation

398
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,519
definitely

399
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,600
yes we'll speak about that vacation in a

400
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,560
short while

401
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,200
very cool thanks thank you very much

402
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:09,920
that's that's

403
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,720
really cool so uh how about people that

404
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,680
don't have

405
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,320
uh you know they have air gap networks

406
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:16,720
so

407
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,160
you need to bypass those parameters

408
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,360
without an internet connection

409
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,399
whatsoever

410
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,639
so this could be nice once we infect one

411
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,720
machine in in also in a closed

412
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,959
network but there are other mechanisms

413
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,240
physical things that

414
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,399
we can with physical access today cyber

415
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,320
physical kinetic to

416
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,000
cyber and cyber to connect it is

417
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,680
attacked that we see all the time and we

418
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,120
perform all the time

419
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,959
so there are a bunch of tools some

420
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,639
commercials some that we can build and

421
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,399
we build by ourselves

422
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,519
those that can connect uh via usb or

423
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,440
directly to

424
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,440
rj45 and then connect to some other

425
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,000
wi-fi or gprs or whatever we can also

426
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,199
use some passive

427
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,839
equipment that can also run payloads so

428
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,199
basically we can

429
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,279
uh prepare the payloads in advance and

430
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,360
just make sure that this equipment does

431
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,079
that

432
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,959
or we can also do uh if we have physical

433
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:05,440
access to

434
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,839
an equipment for example you can go to

435
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,120
the projector

436
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,480
or to a machine to a screen a pc's a

437
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,399
screen and just perform many in the

438
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,240
middle with a box an hdmi man in the

439
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,079
middle you can hack my projector you'll

440
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:18,800
see

441
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,880
uh i can project your hack yeah i can

442
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,320
we're not projecting the hacker you can

443
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,240
also protect the projector

444
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,760
and think about it you know about

445
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,440
meeting rooms in very confidential and

446
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,880
strict places etc

447
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,639
and also with cell phones okay what we

448
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,240
can do with cell phones you know we can

449
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,639
pair them like we did in one attack we

450
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:37,680
paired a

451
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,560
very simple phone uh with uh in a

452
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,120
bluetooth

453
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,600
connection with the machine in in

454
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,639
proximity

455
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,480
and basically attacked that machine with

456
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,160
text messages so we would send text

457
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,600
messages they would be

458
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,000
sent in bluetooth to the paired device

459
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,600
executed in the network

460
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,320
and then send the information back to us

461
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,680
and what about wi-fi

462
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,160
what about you know just random ssid is

463
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,079
going around what can they do to us

464
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,240
what do you think well i think there is

465
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,120
a lot of potential

466
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,040
you come up with an idea how to explain

467
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,480
that yeah i think we should research

468
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:10,880
that

469
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,480
oh yeah we did that okay so please

470
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,959
yeah so this in this example i'm going

471
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,079
to use uh i just

472
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,800
put this payload on on a rubber ducky

473
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,440
but

474
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,120
i'm going to just connect that and and

475
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,720
what this does

476
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,040
is essentially as you see the the first

477
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,240
line of code is

478
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,600
essentially running an elevated uh

479
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,720
an elevated process with partial and

480
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,160
what it will do now is essentially run

481
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,680
a very short function that what this

482
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,519
function does wait a minute

483
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,759
catch the magic let's close the window

484
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:44,720
behind

485
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,480
and then we come back of course when we

486
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,839
do it really we don't have even this

487
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:48,399
window but

488
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,120
i store my magic pocket you'll see yeah

489
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,240
i reused it i abused the dub user um

490
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,800
so and what we do here is for now what

491
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,120
the machine is doing is listening

492
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,360
as you can see now it's connected to

493
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,480
some networks

494
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,399
and it's uh listening in the background

495
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:05,680
to uh

496
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,480
looking for ssids in range and i'm going

497
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:08,959
to

498
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,480
open my mobile hotspot sharing and

499
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,279
i let the machine read periodically

500
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,880
every few seconds

501
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,279
refresh the the wi-fi networks in range

502
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,959
and as you can see a payload was

503
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,560
executed here

504
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,800
right so my payload was just who am i

505
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,680
slash priv

506
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,160
but every command i will run now for my

507
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:30,880
ssid

508
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,920
it's looking for a very specific ssid as

509
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,360
you can see i'm not connected to the

510
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,000
machine

511
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,519
the only thing it's running is it's

512
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,360
looking for an ssid

513
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,839
with some sort of pattern and you can

514
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,000
actually use that and abuse that in

515
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,600
a variety of ways for example you can

516
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,399
prepare some functions uh actually

517
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,480
creating a macro of commands that just

518
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,000
run initiated

519
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,079
right whatever you want we can we can

520
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,000
just recreate the functions for example

521
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,720
a function that

522
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,240
crawls in in files around the

523
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,320
organization and uses some regex

524
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,079
patterns and we can just

525
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,480
send a guy with an infected mobile even

526
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,319
without his knowledge just to bypass

527
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,480
to pass in proximity of that machine and

528
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,760
it will attack itself

529
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,679
and i now changed the name of the

530
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,480
network as you can see uh to something

531
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,559
else and of course we couldn't end this

532
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,720
session without a calc

533
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,640
so we had to pop a calc so to summarize

534
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,400
uh all it takes really to hack any

535
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,160
organization in the world is for you to

536
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,039
be creative

537
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,080
be be the disney of of your cyber uh

538
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,720
operations uh motivation and time is all

539
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,760
it takes

540
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,919
if you can dream it we can make it okay

541
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:40,960
if you can define it

542
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,200
we can do it the hard part is you to

543
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,880
define what you want

544
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,919
humans you know correlate signals please

545
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,000
don't just look at network connections

546
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,120
and processes

547
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,200
the edr here the firewall there

548
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,720
challenge your blue teams uh

549
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,559
make them raise the bar to the next

550
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:57,840
level because

551
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,160
tomorrow it's uh today it's maybe

552
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,840
scriptkey this copy paste tomorrow it

553
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,880
can be somebody

554
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,320
as creative as a door and he is very

555
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,280

and uh so get creative with your team it

557

because it's a job it also pays off

559
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,960
because it's effective and it's fun as

560
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,799
you saw and remember that remember that

561
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:19,520
we lose

562
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,120
and win with points there are no

563
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,600
knockouts no silver bullets in cyber

564
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,320
uh always challenge yourself uh always

565
