1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,159
I am looking forward and excited to

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:03,720
share with you that our next speakers

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,160
one of the speakers I'm personally

4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,799
excited about she is an amazing security

5
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:10,110
professional she's actually a not just a

6
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,490
security professional she is a team

7
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,370
leader she leads security research for

8
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,130
Windows Defender advanced threat

9
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,710
protection at Microsoft now I have to

10
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,330
share with you a secret about our next

11
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,460
speaker her name is Donna Burrell

12
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,369
Donna was here in Israel during the

13
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:29,429
pandemic but she got called by Microsoft

14
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:32,308
to Seattle so she is joining us from the

15
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:36,030
west coast so this next talk may not be

16
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,960
as live as we would all like it to be

17
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,790
she's not right here on this stage but

18
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,890
we're extremely thankful for her for

19
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,700
joining us at this early hour of 0 4:00

20
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,020
in the morning I think or something

21
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,140
around that time all the way in the west

22
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,570
coast so Donna's going to be talking to

23
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,750
us about eliminating alert fatigue a

24
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,180
fantastic topic for an after-lunch

25
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,760
coffee break session grab a coffee

26
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,920
because this is going to be a fast fun

27
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,890
talk about eliminating alert fatigue and

28
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,780
how to do better as a security

29
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,390
professional so Donna started her career

30
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,020
in the famous 8200 unit I know you know

31
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:16,979
what I'm talking about

32
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:19,979
wink wink say no more and she's also

33
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,380
worked for Google in their security team

34
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,229
in Zurich Switzerland Donna is very

35
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:27,299
passionate about operating systems and

36
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,909
windows internals and in her spare time

37
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:32,310
she also volunteers with high school

38
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,590
students mentoring the next generation

39
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,409
of cyber security experts I first met

40
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:39,240
Donna through the black hoodie

41
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,829
initiative which is a reverse

42
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:43,500
engineering seminar for women first

43
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,299
started in Vienna but now it's become a

44
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:47,280
global phenomenon and Donna was working

45
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,320
super hard to actually bring black

46
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,750
hoodie to Israel this summer it didn't

47
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,430
work out because of the pandemic but

48
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,009
sign me up for next year so I hope

49
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:57,810
you're ready for this amazing talk about

50
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,110
eliminating alert fatigue please welcome

51
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,210
give her a round of applause even though

52
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,340
she's not here in the room Donna Burrell

53
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,240
thank you Donna

54
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:16,790
hi everyone thanks for joining my talk

55
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:19,130
about reducing other's fatigue through

56
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:22,730
better engineering I am super excited to

57
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:24,560
share with you some of the work we've

58
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,040
done over the past two years before we

59
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:33,410
start let me introduce myself my name is

60
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:36,200
Donna I am the security research lead

61
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,740
for Windows Defender ATP I am originally

62
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,470
from Israel and currently based in

63
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,530
Seattle Washington in the Microsoft

64
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:49,850
headquarters I work on fascinating

65
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:52,760
research projects and how do you / to

66
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,770
knit to present some of my research in

67
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:57,560
conferences like black hat and blue hat

68
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:03,110
and I love dogs so let's talk about dogs

69
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:09,760
for a second I don't know about you but

70
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,800
my dog is a Barker when I got her I

71
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,580
would be alerted every time she barked

72
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:22,519
but now I learned to ignore the barking

73
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:26,410
as I realize most of it is false alerts

74
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:30,070
when I expect what I experience is

75
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:34,220
alerts fatigue I am tired of wasting my

76
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:39,110
time investigating my dogs alerts this

77
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,180
is exactly what happens to stock teams

78
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:45,110
hunting for threats if they get too many

79
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:48,860
false alerts they experience the same

80
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,900
alert fatigue that we would like to

81
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:55,250
avoid as security vendors you are

82
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:59,019
probably thinking so why do we produce

83
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:06,440
FP in the first place there is a number

84
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:11,090
of reasons for that first we need to

85
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,340
remember that most software and

86
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:17,180
environments that we use are dynamic we

87
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,290
install new software and we

88
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:22,920
update existing software in many cases

89
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:27,030
these contain API miss usage the benign

90
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:30,360
software uses api's in ways that may

91
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,860
seem suspicious

92
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:37,170
another reason for producing FP alerts

93
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:41,700
is data gaps sometimes the security

94
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,370
provider doesn't have the required data

95
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,460
to determine if an activity is malicious

96
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51,120
or not when that happens some will

97
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,220
generate an alert out of conservatism

98
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:59,790
one more reason for FP is false

99
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:03,330
detection logic this could be related to

100
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:07,260
a lack of testing flawed assumptions or

101
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:11,430
other human mistakes I'll talk more

102
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:14,160
about how we can minimize this but I had

103
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,500
mentioned that the the first two reasons

104
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,280
are the core sources of a piece and

105
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,750
fortunately the human factor is normally

106
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:29,220
insignificant the last reason has to do

107
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,350
with a lab alerts misinterpretation

108
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:38,100
when TP alert is identified as an FP

109
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,670
Lert as part of the work I'm presenting

110
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:44,310
today we made some product improvements

111
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:48,240
to address this however this is beyond

112
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,510
the scope of this engineering discussion

113
00:05:55,250 --> 00:06:00,420
all right so we understand the root

114
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:06,210
cause for FPS let's tackle is the

115
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:09,090
traditional approach to producing

116
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:13,170
security alerts is to cover as many TPS

117
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:16,770
as possible with the minimal amount of F

118
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:21,210
beat as the diagram shows we set the

119
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:24,990
threshold based on the context balancing

120
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:29,850
fans and fps highly sensitive

121
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,240
environments

122
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,810
in conservative to ensure they don't

123
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:37,050
skip any TP

124
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,650
generally you want to cover most cases

125
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,080
introduce the list number of offense

126
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:49,000
while avoiding FPS this should be the

127
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,800
approach when introducing a new

128
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,979
detection algorithm however this

129
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:57,750
approach introduces a trade-off between

130
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:04,210
offense and FPS we were looking to shift

131
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,490
the card

132
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:09,250
eliminating fans without compromising

133
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:17,740
FPS through better engineering in order

134
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,409
to do this we need to leverage data to

135
00:07:20,409 --> 00:07:23,889
drive engineering improvements data that

136
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:26,970
helps us understand FB generation

137
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:36,009
focusing on alert conclusion data we

138
00:07:36,009 --> 00:07:38,380
will average data from three different

139
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:42,330
sources first wheels customer feedback

140
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:45,490
four inch alert we produce we ask

141
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:49,690
customers to provide us feedback while

142
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:52,330
we don't always receive feedback it

143
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:57,240
helps draw our attention to pain points

144
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,870
next we leverage expert graders that's

145
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:05,560
our in-house experts that verify alert

146
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,750
accuracy initially the gradient alerts

147
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:15,240
randomly however in order to optimize

148
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,610
their productivity we developed

149
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:22,090
contextual clustering so instead of

150
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:26,729
working through alerts randomly degrade

151
00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:30,190
related alerts in bulk to save plenty of

152
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:34,990
overhead this to manual sources are

153
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:39,190
great but not enough in order to

154
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,589
understand our detection precision rate

155
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:45,070
we need to scale our testing

156
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,980
for that reason we introduced a machine

157
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,800
learning model to predict to predict

158
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,070
alert conclusions leveraging our manual

159
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:57,190
inputs and scaling their impact this

160
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:59,200
tool predicts individual alert

161
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,880
conclusions conclusion using multiple

162
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,010
machine learning models to achieve high

163
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:14,470
confidence alert grades so let's take a

164
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:19,630
moment to understand where we are we

165
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:24,010
understand why we have a piece and the

166
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:28,300
trade off that involves reducing them we

167
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:32,500
can leverage alert conclusion data to

168
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,800
transform this trade off so let's

169
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:43,840
examine how we we started by analyzing

170
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,780
the other generation process breaking it

171
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:51,070
down into its components to identify SP

172
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:54,280
root cause I like to refer to this

173
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:58,660
process as a loop producing new alerts

174
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,180
that are being assessed then being

175
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:06,330
monitored to identify pinpoints to fix

176
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:10,210
breaking the loop into steps helped us

177
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:15,310
to focus our attention on the most

178
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:18,280
vulnerable components to ensure our

179
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:24,090
efforts move the needle as part of this

180
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:28,570
we analyze the process step by step step

181
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:32,770
by step to identify which kind of a

182
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:37,680
speii can be avoided in each component

183
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,500
this included better engineering

184
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:46,240
guardrails and reiterating engineering

185
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,810
guidelines in addition we started to

186
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:53,110
measure SP fixing time in order to

187
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:57,190
minimize it we then tackled the alert

188
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,809
fixing process

189
00:10:58,809 --> 00:11:02,240
introducing new tools and I will cover

190
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,249
in the next slide these tools enabled us

191
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:11,389
to discover SP cases faster and solve

192
00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:14,990
them quickly so even if we produce

193
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:19,329
unwanted FP the fixing cycle will be

194
00:11:19,329 --> 00:11:22,999
closed first without customer reporting

195
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:26,029
and before customers even notice it in

196
00:11:26,029 --> 00:11:28,089
most cases

197
00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:32,180
for example we introduced a note a new

198
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,910
component into the alert generation

199
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:41,649
process that's the FP filter this filter

200
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:45,499
combines rule-based logic and machine

201
00:11:45,499 --> 00:11:49,459
learning models to address FP in real

202
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:55,300
time before they become customer facing

203
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,639
the rule based filtering enables us to

204
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,540
apply broad filtering for common FPS

205
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:06,550
patterns across different type of alerts

206
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:10,480
the machine learning model predicts FP

207
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,730
based on prior conclusions and other

208
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:19,120
contextual features if the FP filter

209
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,129
makes a definitive judgment on a

210
00:12:22,129 --> 00:12:25,699
specific pattern we will circle this

211
00:12:25,699 --> 00:12:29,019
insight back into our detection logic

212
00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:32,959
however this component is intended to

213
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,800
pick up on unpredictable behaviors that

214
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,620
cannot be programmed but cannot be

215
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:45,999
programmed into the detection logic and

216
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:49,670
last I previously mentioned Auto grading

217
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:52,459
tool which is another addition to the

218
00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:55,970
alert generation process that enhances

219
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:59,660
our detection capabilities the auto

220
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:05,089
graders the auto grades are fed into

221
00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:09,049
this flow supporting the precision

222
00:13:09,049 --> 00:13:10,380
assessment

223
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:14,459
and the detection fixing and of course

224
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:23,600
the SP filtering the next step to reduce

225
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,220
SP through better engineering is to

226
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:32,660
introduce new tools the first tool we

227
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:36,720
developed is a proactive and normally

228
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,810
detection tool the monitors alerts

229
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:45,029
monitor alerts production in real-time

230
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:50,600
and flag the suspect FP based on

231
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:55,100
observed anomalies such as volume spikes

232
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:59,910
this tool notifies us when it detects

233
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:03,930
cross customers and normal ease these

234
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:07,050
are phenomena that impact multiple

235
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:11,269
customers making a bridge less likely

236
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:14,550
this notification will trigger an

237
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:18,360
internal flow of urgent fixing to

238
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,370
address this case we also introduced an

239
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:26,899
alert clustering system which clusters

240
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:32,730
alerts based on features similarity and

241
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:35,519
then delivers a conclusion for each

242
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,560
cluster this way we get an overview of

243
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,510
alert patterns and we can tackle them at

244
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:50,610
scale providing a conclusion such as TP

245
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:55,800
or FP for each pattern this allows us to

246
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,740
review the alert patterns and their

247
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:02,639
conclusion automatically and reduce time

248
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:10,170
to fix to summarize as part of our

249
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:14,300
engineering efforts to minimize FP cases

250
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:19,350
we first analyzed the overall allure

251
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,440
generation process

252
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,210
for improvement in addition we

253
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:29,420
introduced a new SP filtering component

254
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:33,160
to filter FPS in real-time

255
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:37,060
next we developed the automatic grading

256
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:41,090
mechanism to create alerts at scale for

257
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:46,130
better conclusions then created the

258
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:49,970
alert and normally monitoring to detect

259
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:55,670
FP cases in real time so we can tackle

260
00:15:55,670 --> 00:16:00,310
them quickly last is our alert

261
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:04,070
clustering approach which was introduced

262
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:08,210
multiple times as part of alert grading

263
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:20,540
and as post alert FP analysis our main

264
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,580
takeaways from this process

265
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:28,040
our first clustering increases our

266
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,520
productivity so that instead of

267
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:35,710
reviewing FP case by case we can cluster

268
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:39,830
similarities review alerts in bulk and

269
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:45,500
tackle them at scale second by breaking

270
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,440
down processes we can better engineer a

271
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:53,750
solution it allows us to analyze steps

272
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:58,100
along the chain determine which ones can

273
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,700
be automated and of course scale human

274
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:08,720
impact empowering researchers next like

275
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,380
the old-fashioned engineering approach

276
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:14,839
we should always start small with a few

277
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:19,810
C proved its value and then scale

278
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:24,230
everything I presented today started

279
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:30,100
from a POC last in order to produce

280
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:34,240
meaningful results that move the needle

281
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,880
I must identify which key levers we need

282
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:45,790
to optimize for we optimize for time to

283
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:51,160
discover time to fix and detection

284
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:55,660
precision precision to keep our eyes on

285
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,260
the ball
