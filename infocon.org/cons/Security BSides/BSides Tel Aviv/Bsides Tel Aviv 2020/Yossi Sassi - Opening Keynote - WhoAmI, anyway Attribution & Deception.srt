i'm going to talk with you uh in this uh

62
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,599
almost afternoon

63
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,680
opening keynote i'm going to talk to you

64
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,200
a bit uh about

65
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,560
some topics that in some of them i'm

66
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,720
really far from being an expert which is

67
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,720
privacy and things like that

68
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,239
much greater people have spoken about

69
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,480
this in the past but i want to touch

70
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,360
a bit more in depth about who are we

71
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,200
anyway in this generation and to touch

72
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,000
about topics

73
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,200
such as deception attribution false

74
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,000
flags etc

75
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,360
which are things that i can actually

76
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,040
really comment about from my personal

77
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,480
experience but first

78
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,080
things first who are you

79
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,519
who is but the form following the

80
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,680
function of what and what i am is a man

81
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,640
in a mosque

82
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,879
well i can see that of course you can

83
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,480
i'm not questioning your powers of

84
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,080
observation i'm merely remarking upon

85
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,239
the paradox of asking a masked man

86
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,480
who he is right

87
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,120
well arguably maybe not natalie

88
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,720
portman's best

89
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,159
performance but of course this classic

90
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,000
scene from v4 vendetta

91
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
really sets the tone for the things we

92
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,760
are talking about this morning

93
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,680
and this is identities identities are

94
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,879
the new perimeters

95
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,800
actually we've even evolved since this

96
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,159
sentence but we know

97
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,800
we've made a long way from the perimeter

98
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,640
the classic perimeter security

99
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,879
and identities cross perimeters and

100
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,959
today it's ironically it's very

101
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,080
uh easy to repudiate actions but it can

102
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,000
be also very very hard to achieve

103
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,280
non-repudiation and

104
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,080
we'll speak about this pendulum effect

105
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,040
so we'll talk about

106
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,799
a bit really in a nutshell about the

107
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,879
challenges that we have today

108
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,959
in security at the foundations

109
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,000
essentially why we

110
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,879
got here in the first place and we'll

111
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,319
speak about the challenges in

112
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,439
privacy deception and attribution

113
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,560
um so who am i uh

114
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,319
well i'm not questioning your powers of

115
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,159
observation um

116
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,720
merely remarking uh the paradox of

117
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,640
asking a man with a buzukitara

118
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,599
who he is so i am the mother of

119
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,720
uzukitara

120
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,720
there is also a father but i i invested

121
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,959
a bit more in the upbringing of this

122
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,560
instrument including conceiving it

123
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,279

uh quite a while it's been 33 years by

130
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,720
now uh

131

132
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,720
i'm

133
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,880
also doing information security research

134
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,440
especially on bypass of operating system

135
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,400
and living of the land hacks and doing

136
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,080

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,560
i'm also the co-founder at ten route

141
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,639
cyber security we're a small fun team we

142
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,400
hack for good meaning that uh

143
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,040
you have to pay us to hack you and and

144
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,560
we'll get less than we could have in

145
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,360
bitcoin

146
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,680
uh and will pay the taxes but it's still

147
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,919
it's it's fun to have good values

148
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,400
uh i had an episode in late 90s early

149
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,759
2000s when i was in

150
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,520
working for microsoft coding tools for

151
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,720
windows server so basically this was the

152
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,680
time that i was

153
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,440
i think the only employee that had the

154
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,680
lilo dual boot with the linux machine in

155
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,560
microsoft

156
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,039
i couldn't say it out loud because steve

157
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,400
ballmer used to call linux

158
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,400
cancer at those days i think they

159
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,000
destroyed that video

160
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,759
but it's really amazing to see microsoft

161
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,600
hugging open source today that's that's

162
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,199
such a blissful

163
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,240
move and change of tone it sometimes you

164
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,759
feel like it's more like a bear hugs you

165
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:40,880
but still it's a hug

166
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,600
so it's it's something warm and i made

167
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,199
the trip from atari

168
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,160
through apple 2c openvms et cetera linux

169
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,759
windows and back to industrial control

170
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:50,479
systems

171
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,600
so in a way from atari to scada i kind

172
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,160
of

173
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,600
did the trip back to to

174
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,199
systems from 80s and i'm the guy that

175
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,440
gets a lot of calls in incident response

176
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,720
hectic directory a term i coined

177
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,039
uh powershell go to guy and i was

178
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,880
privileged enough to be part of javelin

179
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,520
networks

180
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,319
ex-israeli air force intelligence corps

181
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,039
company that was sold in late 2018

182
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,160
to symantec and today we have actually

183
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,160
uh three talks with the javelin ex

184
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,520
so that's that's nice this is what

185
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,280
people think i'm doing

186
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,479
especially uh my family if i speak to

187
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:31,039
them

188
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,479
i'm saying i'm a hacker that's what they

189
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,000
think i'm doing that's what i was really

190
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,440
doing for many years

191
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,800
as karen mentioned i'm a proud father my

192
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,080
eldest is almost 19 danielle and she's

193
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,240
coding very well in python and she

194
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,280
already did her

195
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,960
first hack or two under my ethical

196
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,000
surveillance uh but this is what i'm

197
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,880
really doing so

198
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,199
um i read a lot of winnie the pooh

199
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,960
stories back in the day

200
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,960
to my three daughters by the way there's

201
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,360
a nice joke here from

202
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,080
in hebrew it says stories from a forest

203
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,520
by hackers

204
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,280
really that's that's what this cover

205
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,880
says on this famous uh

206
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,360
a.a milan story i looked it up and

207
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,560
apparently it's

208
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,759
stories from the 100 acre forest

209
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,919
so even before google translate we had

210
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:18,960
the translation

211
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,120
glitch and last thing about how geek i

212
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,000
am last year

213
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,880
we moved department i xml tagged the

214
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,199
boxes

215
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,440
this is how geek i am and i saw it only

216
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,440
in retrospect so next time i'm going to

217
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,280
json them

218
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,080
okay so i i think all information

219
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,759
security challenges today really can be

220
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,000
traced back to the to the design goals

221
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,720
and and the

222
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,240
core design mindset of the internet

223
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,560
protocol suites you see

224
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,520
security privacy non-repudiation

225
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,680
confidentiality spoofing all this

226
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,240
was never in the mindset of the late 60s

227
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,520
and early 70s when

228
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,319
and when tcpap and all this started the

229
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,240
purpose was more to survive after a

230
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,000
partial subset of failure

231
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,080
and basically connect multiple networks

232
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,039
to a single one

233
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,879
and security is just a patch it's a

234
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,120
band-aid that we've added along the

235
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,479
years later on

236
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,160
and that's something that you feel until

237
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,520
today

238
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,280
and and really it feels that in many

239
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,199
things we haven't made any progress at

240
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:15,520
all

241
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,440
you can't blame those guys this was i

242
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,520
remember you reminding you that late 60s

243
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,360
was woodstock and stuff like that nobody

244
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,240
thought about

245
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,919
uh you know it was way before september

246
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,599
11th or thing like that

247
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,800
humanity was was in a high mood but yes

248
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,639
security was totally forgotten from the

249
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:31,120
table

250
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,200
and had to be patched later but we have

251
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,719
made progress since then we have made

252
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,320
progress in general in computing for

253
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,039
example

254
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,679
we used to have in computers buttons

255
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,200
that can actually slow down your

256
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,719
computer

257
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,399
that's right there are few people here

258
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,240
in the room and probably also at home

259
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,880
that remember there was a time in

260
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,160
humanity

261
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,760
that you had a button that you you could

262
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,279
say to your computer i don't need so

263
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,080
much performance

264
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,680
i need you to slow down because my

265
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,200
application is not running well

266
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,880
so you can actually turn it down we made

267
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,320
a lot of progress we also made the

268
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,200
progress

269
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,839
in terms of uh pop-ups and and all kinds

270
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:04,880
of

271
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,000
messages i love this tweet by rob graham

272
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,080
uh regarding this internet explorer

273
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,519
box about the security alert you know

274
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,040
with a really nice informative alert and

275
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,680
button there that you're about to engage

276
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,160
with that ssl tls

277
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,000
connection only you and your and the

278
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,920
server are going to be able to see what

279
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,560
you're doing

280
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,560
and you have to approve that so but at

281
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:37,360
the end of the day

282
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,519
i'm asking you really come on what do

283
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,279
you need in life of course i dropped out

284
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,880
of high school to practice hacking and

285
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,440
music

286
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,240
so but later i completed two or three

287
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,760
degrees with distinction and i learned

288
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,600
about the maslow pyramid of needs

289
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,040
and the master pyramid of needs which

290
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,640
i'm i'm guessing you probably heard

291
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,720
about or know about

292
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,560
goes between the basic needs that you

293
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,800
need right the physical needs and

294
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,079
all the way up to self-realization

295
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:03,040
self-actualization

296
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,959
i don't know if you've heard but lately

297
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,240
they've updated this

298
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,800
pyramid and added two more uh layers to

299
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,800
it apparently today

300
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,399
you first need a battery then a wi-fi

301
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,079
connection and then your physical needs

302
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,120
maybe perhaps

303
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,560
can be addressed you know to take a

304
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,160
shower or something and

305
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,120
although this is semi semi funny uh this

306
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,680
is

307
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,240
you know kind of uh infograph about what

308
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,920
cyber really is because we used to be

309
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,120
people and computers

310
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,160
right uh back in the late 80s or or in

311
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,240
the 90s uh we used to work with

312
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,200
computers but

313
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,560
when we didn't touch them we weren't

314
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,640
connected to anything and and today you

315
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,000
wake up in the morning and

316
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,519
and you've touched four five six

317
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,200
computers and and you've been

318
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,320
uh analyzed or been recorded by

319
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,360
a dozen others and and today this fabric

320
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:47,680
of

321
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,519
hardware essentially just you know stuff

322
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,279
and code which is text you know just

323
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,120
text who wrote that text did you write

324
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,920
this text

325
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,760
did you read this text did i write this

326
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,240
text trust me i'm a hacker what can go

327
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,120
wrong

328
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,000
uh and people are actually uh

329
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,839
collaborating so in this uh

330
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,000
very thin line between people and text

331
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,200
and and

332
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,959
um how do we are existing uh the hopes

333
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,079
uh

334
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,880
uh given to computers uh were were quite

335
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,920
early uh being

336
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,600
um criteria with uh this is a quote from

337
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,600
uh professor yashao lebovich quite a

338
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,040
controversial and colorful

339
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,320
rest in peace uh character that we've

340
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:28,720
had

341
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,320
this is from a cover from a book in the

342
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,760
60s quite around

343
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,920
the time that tcpip design and

344
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,279
everything emerged

345
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,279
and from a computer science book

346
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,880
computer information systems

347
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,560
it says the the hopes we're putting on

348
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,320
the computer are very exaggerated

349
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,920
it doesn't release the person from

350
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,600
thinking but from calculating

351
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,920
computing and it certainly doesn't

352
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,920
release it from the necessity to reach a

353
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,800
decision

354
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,279
and and make it happen and follow it and

355
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,560
that's an interesting quote

356
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,880
because today to to say it out loud on

357
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,959
stage it really sounds very naive

358
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,480
but that's something that really a lot

359
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,880
of people felt strongly about

360
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,200
and when we think about the lack of

361
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,760
security and privacy in the design

362
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,440
there are many many examples to show

363
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,160
that right so to start off of course

364
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,040
we're none of us are really uh anonymous

365
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,480
of course in in uh

366
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,480
private browsing uh right so uh if we

367
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,399
you know just every website that you

368
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,320
browse to that this is a

369
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,000
one of my servers but of course this is

370
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,360
a very simple uh

371
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,639
php code uh server side even so you know

372
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,399
you're sending everything to that server

373
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,399
your local port is a lot of things your

374
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,519
user agent

375
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,680
and of course this can be uh changed

376
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,800
right you can

377
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,200
actually uh manipulate your user agent

378
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,839
so

379
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,959
this thing works two way two ways so but

380
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,959
by default for nobody is anonymous

381
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,200
in anything and then of course there is

382
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,519
a set of tools that can help you

383
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,480
uh to get uh a bit more private right

384
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,600
there are proxies

385
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,519
and vpns aka glorified proxies and there

386
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,160
is tor

387
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,040
and there is hunix with with uh that you

388
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,160
can also drive

389
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,880
with without hunix and two vms uh

390
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,519
throughout

391
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,560
enablehood and and change wifis

392
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,120
uh so there are levels of anonymity that

393
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,320
you can achieve

394
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,120
uh but then again uh to really escape uh

395
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,160
the fact to be um discovered you really

396
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,000
need to take into account metadata

397
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,680
and metadata is is a huge thing metadata

398
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,279
even when you're encrypting everything

399
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,959
your whatsapp your calls your

400
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,480
and you're in vpn et cetera there is

401
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,560
still this metadata and metadata counts

402
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,160
it matters because it tells a story

403
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,519
about you

404
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,199
it's the junction where pieces of

405
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,199
information are collected and

406
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,040
it's not necessarily a right story by

407
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,480
the way the fact that

408
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,760
my uh my cell phone was in the same cell

409
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,760
tower triangulation in a certain

410
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,600
time of the day with a criminal doesn't

411
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,800
mean that i was meeting with that

412
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,760
criminal

413
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,839
uh but certainly can tell a lot of

414
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,199
stories about you from this

415
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,959
metadata so uh 101 privacy is that

416
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,079
anonymity and privacy

417
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,199
are not the same thing right when

418
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,279
privacy is a basic thing that we all

419
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,360
strive for and we all deserve it's it's

420
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,600
embedded in the laws of every modern

421
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,440
society and democracy

422
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,160
you are you have the perfect right to do

423
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,160
what you want in your four walls to

424
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,480
dance naked or whatever anonymity is

425
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,920
something a bit different

426
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,320
uh it's also legitimate for many needs

427
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,399
you know if you're doing a friendly

428
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,120
whistle-blowing exposing corruptions if

429
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,399
you're a journalist

430
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,959
for the sake of democracy from dark

431
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,800
regimes and dictatorships

432
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,519
but uh you can also do some things that

433
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:37,920
hurt

434
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,199
other people or or are criminal uh

435
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,279
crimes uh when you're anonymous so it's

436
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,560
definitely not the same thing

437
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,480
what we see clearly is that the request

438
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,720
for legitimate privacy from individuals

439
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,760
is of course all the time colliding uh

440
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,040
and interfering with law enforcement and

441
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,839
national security and and now we see it

442
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,440
even more than ever with the with the

443
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,560
last uh

444
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,800
stride on global health so you see a

445
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,880
kovit 19 and what that's bringing so

446
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,079
people speaking about

447
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,040
from bluetooth bracelets to of course uh

448
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,720
uh the the cell phone that

449
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,880
cell tower triangulations and and you

450
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,800
know the it's still open to

451
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,000
uh even more things that will come

452
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,839
speaking about identifying people and

453
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,440
the lack of identity

454
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,800
sometimes technology comes for the

455
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,800
greater good to do some nice things

456
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,399
for example in this nice research

457
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,600
they've done an x model from identifying

458
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,399
people

459
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,519
behind a wall you can identify

460
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,759
somebody through the wall from a

461
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:38,880
candidate video

462
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,959
so you take a candidate and all you need

463
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,880
is wi-fi it's two antennas one transient

464
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,720
transmitting other receiving

465
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,880
uh apparently our gestures our body

466
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,120
gestures our movements are unique to us

467
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,639
and can identify us

468
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,639
in in a very high rate more than eighty

469
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:53,759
percent uh

470
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,079
success rate and you take a candidate

471
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,160
video you just take you build a 3d mesh

472
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,759
a model from the movements of those

473
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:00,399
people

474
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,680
of course you convert it to the

475
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,800
right model in in the returns the

476
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,000
descendant returns

477
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,959
of the waves behind that uh wall and you

478
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:11,680
can actually

479
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,320
identify people and this leads us to one

480
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,600
of the most challenging

481
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,800
problems to to find out who did what and

482
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,720
and the challenge of attribution is just

483
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,480
getting more and more

484
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,680
evident and and very very very hard to

485
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,600
to figure out attribution essentially is

486
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,279
proving the source of an attack the

487
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,000
source of

488
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,639
the guy doing the things and you know

489
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,720
with the time forensic analysts really

490
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,160
developed it to a whole bunch of

491
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,920
best practices and a lot of

492
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,000
methodologies to really determine

493
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,320
uh the source of actions you know by

494
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,160
using means like code and closing the

495
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,759
code and the infrastructure

496
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,839
connections and political motivations

497
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,279
what's going on in their

498
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,560
actual life of that nation state etc uh

499
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,279
many companies do this code attribution

500
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:57,920
or

501
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,560
guessing uh attributions from the code

502
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,120
itself infrastructure etc like intesar

503
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,199
and many many other companies and you

504
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,160
can see this

505
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,959
sometimes it's it's fairly easy right if

506
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,240
i'm giving you this attribution

507
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,160
challenge you will solve it very quickly

508
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,160
like for example uh if you can tell me

509
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,280
who wrote

510
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,720
this piece of malware if i'm taking in

511
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,480
one part of this malware is as you see

512
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,199
is this called get user default language

513
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,760
id

514
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,599
and you see there is a condition check

515
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,119
if the result is somewhere in the

516
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,079
russian

517
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,200
federation then abort exit process so

518
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,480
clearly what we can

519
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,720
assume from that is of course that this

520
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,160
is a

521
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,640
russian malware it's designed and it has

522
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,799
in the very beginning of the payload

523
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,799
a very specific check that if you you've

524
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,559
infected the russian machine you just

525
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:45,280
need to

526
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,640
exit this process and you can also

527
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,760
infect with a bit more advanced uh

528
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,919
payloads you can you can use a fuscation

529
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,240
string manipulations polymorphic

530
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,120
malwares etc and you can also use zero

531
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,160
days and zero days

532
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,720
uh either you find which is it takes

533
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,480
some time but you can find researchers

534
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,080
find it and they report it

535
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,000
uh companies find and report academy

536
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,760
find a report many people find and they

537
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,280
don't report

538
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,919
they don't report uh either because you

539
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:14,320
know

540
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,520
their own special interests but but can

541
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,160
be also

542
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,640
a nation state or or intelligence agency

543
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,520
etc

544
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,640
but there are stock uh markets for

545
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,559
exchanging uh zero days one of the more

546
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:27,200
known ones is

547
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,880
rhodium which is totally anonymous

548
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,039
sellers and buyers so in the radium you

549
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,559
can actually sell of course

550
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,559
uh zero-day exploits that actually make

551
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:35,840
you do things

552
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,880
by bypassing a lot of the design uh the

553
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,559
core architecture of that product remote

554
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:41,919
code execution local privilege

555
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:42,640
escalation

556
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,200
zero click etc and the payouts are also

557
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,240
very very good

558
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,720
so you can sell and buy anonymously to

559
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,440
everyone

560
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,320
everyone so you can actually be an

561
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,320
iranian guy and you can sell a zero day

562
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,760
to the most sad

563
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,280
and you can sell it to the americans and

564
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,039
you can sell it to a mexican

565
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,520
crime conglomerate and you'll never know

566
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,120
that you actually did that and you can

567
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,120
also sell it to your own country without

568
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,679
knowing that you did that and speaking

569
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,280
about nation states you of course any

570
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,400
organizations can

571
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,880
and will be hacked breaches are

572
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,880
inevitable period we know that as

573
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,480
hackers right that's what we do all day

574
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,760
we have 100

575
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,840
success rate all it takes to hack any

576
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,200
organization in the world

577
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,679
is motivation and time and in motivation

578
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,000
we put ideology and money

579
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,320
and all kinds of resources right uh

580
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,080
industrial espionages from

581
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,880
those of the other uh cia nsa nasa and

582
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,080
the list goes on

583
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,600
and on and what happens when uh

584
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,440
the this type of nation state gets

585
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,760
hacked or or what happens when they use

586
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,320
zero days in the public so this can

587
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:44,799
happen

588
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,080
for example when you get exposed using a

589
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,160
zero day as a as a nation state for

590
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,120
example

591
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,720
so this is a real

592
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,000
explanation from the white house site

593
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,120
it's called process transparency because

594
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,360
after following a set of events set of

595
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,919
breaches nsa cia etc vault 7 shadow

596
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,200
brokers etc so

597
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,960
the american regime had had to

598
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,440
explain a bit uh and what this

599
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,280
essentially says is that

600
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,559
if the united states of america finds

601
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,480
a zero-day vulnerability in one of its

602
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,080
three-letter dozens of trilateral

603
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,600
economic agencies

604
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,960
it will not disclose it to microsoft or

605
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,960
adobe or even to american companies

606
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,039
because the need for national security

607
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:31,520
over

608
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,360
uh exceeds the uh the need of those

609
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,720
commercial companies

610
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,200
and but we saw it also balancing for

611
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,559
example in cv 2020601 the

612
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,280
notorious crypto api spoof in the early

613
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,880
in january 2020

614
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,679
we saw the nsa actually giving to

615
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:50,559
microsoft

616
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,679
working with them to expose this fix i

617
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,200
have a

618
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,480
calculated guess why they did that and i

619
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,080
don't think it's the blue eyes of

620
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,480
anybody but the classic dimensions of

621
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,840
war are totally shifting

622
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,760
i believe and hope that also my

623
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,600
colleague chris kubeka will speak about

624
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,520
that later in the closing keynote

625
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,360
and cyber the fifth dimension of war

626
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,880
really changes everything so these

627
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,320
carriers that we saw

628
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,280
doing wonders and dominating the wars of

629
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,720
iraq and afghanistan

630
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,080
really really far from what's happening

631
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,400
today today we are at war we are at

632
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,400
with in multiple fronts but it's a very

633
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,520
silent war

634
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,960
and the digital uh arms are are simply

635
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,159
their weapons

636
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,080
like like anything else it's a it's

637
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,200
actually a

638
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,280
a very useful weapon it has a very low

639
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,799
signature it travels

640
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,760
uh many miles in matter of seconds it

641
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,720
doesn't have to

642
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,320
it's not meant it doesn't have to risk

643
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,240
human lives unnecessarily

644
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,440
but it's a two-way street so if you get

645
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,720
an airplane of

646
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,159
some country or or you get the

647
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,240
bombshells just the debris you can't

648
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,799
do a lot with that when you get hit by

649
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,559
your adversary but when you you get

650
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,480
a malware and you capture it in an air

651
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,520
gap network or in a base or on a water

652
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,320
facility you can reverse engineer it and

653
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,360
then you can learn every

654
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,360
everything about your opponent you can

655
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,120
learn about this modus operandi about

656
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,320
his ip

657
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,240
actually the intellectual property that

658
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,080
they have in this malware you can

659
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,640
uh use it against your opponent you can

660
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,120
actually alter it and even enhance it

661
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,840
etc etc so it's really challenging and

662
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,919
the fact that we see with identities

663
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,840
and attribution etc is that it's getting

664
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,120
worse because we see

665
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,400
uh for quite some years now uh clear

666
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,960
uh evidence of false flag in cyber false

667
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,559
flag like we used to have

668
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,280
in uh in pirates back in the day they

669
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:37,840
used to

670
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,159
approach ships in open sea with the

671
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,400
friendly flag like of spain or some

672
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,520
other kingdom of explorers and then when

673
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,880
they were close enough they would

674
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,280
uh reveal the identity but in cyber we

675
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,480
see false flag

676
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,559
using other people's malware or pieces

677
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,240
of code or

678
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,400
just you know modifying and spoofing

679
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,159
headers or files etc

680
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,760
just to appear as if you're coming from

681
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,600
another nation state we have very known

682
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,320
cases

683
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,960
like the pay young olympics the olympic

684
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,880
destroyer malware

685
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,039
essentially think thought for a long

686
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,320
time uh that

687
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,320
it was done by north korea and actually

688
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,600
was in a very

689
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,880
uh thorough and rigorous step was uh

690
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,280
linked in in very high percent to to

691
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,080
russia

692
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,400
and speaking about russia we saw also in

693
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,679
the last

694
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:28,400
year some evidence exposed allegedly

695
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,120
that russia was using tula essentially a

696
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,640
russian group hijacked tools from

697
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,760
iranian unit or oil rig

698
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:51,840
and to attack to lead attack on

699
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,000
it's a nice concept it's a very uh

700
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,120
mature concept

701
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,799
it had the use of honey pots for for a

702
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:05,679
long time which is quite obsolete in a

703
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:06,960
way

704
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,360
but today you know honeypots are just

705
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,960
lures you know they're just traps it's

706
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,360
very

707
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,720
easy to plant them but it's also very

708
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,880
easy to find them as seasoned hackers we

709
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,520
find

710
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,520
a large percent of honeypots in the

711
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,200
customer environment when we come in

712
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,080
engagement

713
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,080
it's very easy to recognize them

714
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,840
multiple computers pointing to the same

715
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,720
ip

716
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,880
and injecting elsa's credentials without

717
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,159
a logon server

718
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,919
it's very very easy to recognize them so

719
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:31,440
we need to take deception to the next

720
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,080
level

721
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,159
so deception can be used also two-way

722
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,000
everything in cyber is two-way deception

723
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,960
can be used

724
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,600
by malware to uh evade defenses

725
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,360
obfuscations etc and defense says

726
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,440
defenders can also use deception to

727
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,000
deter adversaries and actually hide mask

728
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,679
the real assets and and that's what we

729
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,520
did in javelin networks

730
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,400
uh and uh in javelin next we saw we saw

731
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:52,799
first

732
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,640
first of all that it's very easy to

733
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,400
bypass honeypots right deception really

734
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,840
needs to go to the next level

735
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,000
the other thing we saw is that active

736
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,760
directory active directory this

737
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,799
rockstar of microsoft internal it

738
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,400
networks

739
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,120
is involved in almost every apt around

740
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,000
the world

741
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,480
and every apt that you research doesn't

742
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,360
matter who

743
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,559
found out and and explored that malware

744
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,480
so it has a idea enumeration and

745
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,679
credential theft

746
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,480
inside of it and so we took the the

747
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,320
steps to do an evolution in assets

748
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,360
deception

749
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,159
and did an in-memory total adversary

750
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:29,440
perception control

751
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,559
by using hooks user mode

752
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:35,200
hooks injections inside the memory for

753
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,720
each and every process

754
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,440
luckily for all of you today the person

755
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,320
speaking

756
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,799
after me is omer yair the endpoint

757
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:43,919
security lead

758
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,039
uh from javelin uh also then symantec

759
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,159
then broadcom

760
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,799
and uh he's the number one guy to this

761
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,720
topic and he will take you from zero

762
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,240
to uh nation state in in 25 minutes

763
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,240
about how we did that but in a nutshell

764
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,840
we basically controlled the perception

765
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,679
by uh just

766
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,760
in every api every protocol doesn't

767
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,720
matter

768
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,000
what you query about users computers

769
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,559
group memberships service principal

770
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:11,120
names

771
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,159
sql instances whatever then we mask it

772
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,640
once we inject to the the code into the

773
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,360
memory

774
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,520
so we give you 10 times multiple quality

775
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,360
fakes there is an nlp engine that

776
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,000
learns the customer environment all the

777
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,640
prefix suffix with dictionaries etc

778
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,679
and we we add some bat wings to it

779
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,159
and not not bad from wohan but really

780
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:33,200
kosher bats

781
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,200
and we mix this all together and we do

782
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,240
our magic

783
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,760
by the way somewhere here there's also a

784
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,279
decoy admin a real admin

785
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,200
not an injected delta's credential but

786
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,120
it really it's a real user

787
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,480
uh but it's a deco user with

788
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,000
regular permissions that appears to be a

789
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,159
domain admin and you get high fidelity

790
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:51,440
alerts through opposite

791
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,080
false positive through a positive alerts

792
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,799
on that

793
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,520
so we can use different controls of

794
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,400
course to

795
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,200
detect uh malicious activities uh the

796
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,720
preventive deterrent

797
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,120
detective confirming etc but what about

798
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,520
using prevention through a deterrent

799
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,919
control so we can actually prevent

800
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,679
malware from making progress

801
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,480
uh on the endpoint itself and use it as

802
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,840
a deterrent control

803
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,279
right so for example that's what that's

804
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,679
the thing that for example the guys in

805
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,120
minerva are doing

806
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,080
so in minerva they're also using a rope

807
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:24,399
and

808
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:27,600
other kinds of user mode hooks in memory

809
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,000
if you remember this example i showed

810
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,600
you a couple of slide early slides

811
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,720
earlier

812
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,600
about the default language user id so a

813
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,720
malware comes in

814
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,919
and asks you know am i running a russian

815
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,279
language os so then in that point

816
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,240
this call will be intercepted and the

817
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,360
answer will come back

818
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,720
yes so if you answer in memory to that

819
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,080
malware

820
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,000
that yes you are running a language or a

821
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,200
russian language but actually you're

822
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,960
running a hebrew or whatever

823
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,240
uh os then you can actually trick

824
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,760
the malware in memory to use its abort

825
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,960
built-in uh function uh look at it

826
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,039
it's it's a real-time memory hooking yes

827
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,799
it's something that happens in real time

828
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,279
very fast it's actually it's more fast

829
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,120
than the operating system itself

830
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,120
so in that mechanism of uh deception

831
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,960
minerva also uses sometimes some

832
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,440
delays in the algorithm so the malware

833
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,080
will appear

834
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,320
it's it's uh real that you actually

835
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,520
access the disks

836
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,120
or you did something and and things

837
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,520
didn't happen in memory so that that's

838
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,919
that's the deterrent uh prevention there

839
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,200
and think about this

840
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,880
uh when you we when you think about

841
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,960
stuxnet right the stuxnet warm was

842
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,159
something totally autonomous it had a a

843
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,360
wide tree with a branch of decisions and

844
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:43,919
uh

845
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:47,039
think about that if if the the guys

846
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,640
there would have something like that and

847
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,480
it will infect a scada machine it would

848
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,919
affect the pc connected to the

849
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,559
plc et cetera then the first things that

850
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:55,840
the malware if you saw

851
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,880
a stuxnet code and and of course like

852
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,240
many others also have

853
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,279
uh revisions of it on my machine so

854
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:06,240
you see that it's actually probing uh

855
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,919
it's asking some questions it wants to

856
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,679
know if it got to natanz the

857
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,000
iranian nuclear facility are these

858
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,919
siemens pcs are these plcs from a

859
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,159
specific frequency converter

860
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,159
because they don't want to attack power

861
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:19,760
plants in the u.s et cetera

862
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,000
so with this mechanism in place you can

863
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,960
actually say

864
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,080
no there is no siemens plc

865
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,559
no you're not in natanz and then it will

866
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,080
just simply abort

867
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,360
uh tens of millions of dollars of uh

868
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,480
multinational uh allegedly operation

869
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,760
uh or in other words these are not the

870
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,960
droids you're looking for

871
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,640
so uh we don't know what covet 19 will

872
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,200
bring

873
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,039
you know like i said the cell tower

874
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,320
triangulation trojan

875
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,880
apps in your cell phones new types of

876
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,679
passports

877
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:57,039
embedded in our body i'm not sure uh

878
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,720
but i do know that everything works in a

879
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,720
pendulum in life in general and in cyber

880
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,000
in particular

881
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,440
and everything comes back to us and uh

882
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,200
the real dilemma here is that unlike

883
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,880
september september 11th

884
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,000
that uh you know was used uh the fear

885
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,880
after this terror wave was used to uh

886
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,760
put acts

887
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,240
like the patriot act and and to run

888
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,120
rules

889
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,919
and laws that uh invaded privacy more

890
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:22,880
than ever

891
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,200
uh i'm sure that this will bring its own

892
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,399
wave of uh

893
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,240
of hurting privacy along around the

894
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,760
world it's already happening

895
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,279
uh but this time it's a bit it's a real

896
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,279
dilemma because it's it's our health

897
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,880
it's not something like terror happening

898
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,640
in another country and it's like

899
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,919
perceived at least as a global pandemic

900
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:41,679
and that's that's that's a challenging

901
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,600
thing to wait to be seen

902
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,080
so key takeaways for my morning slash

903
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,240
almost afternoon opening keynote

904
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,799
it's very challenging to both correlate

905
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,320
actions to entities

906
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,000
as well as to maintain some basic

907
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,600
privacy today although you can get a

908
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,519
very high level of privacy

909
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,279
but still you probably forgot some

910
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,039
metadata or you

911
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,919
uh forgot to that the file you you open

912
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:04,720
the file

913
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,480
while you were browsing in your perfect

914
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,080
privacy world etc

915
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,159
uh the pendulum effect in this cat and

916
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,000
mouse mouse stuff

917
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,880
uh race uh between parties so all things

918
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,360
cyber

919
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,000
are two ways right privacy attribution

920
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
deception false flags we've seen

921
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,919
i hope i got you a chance to get a

922
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,320
glimpse from this huge iceberg

923
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,279
of hunting around identities uh and to

924
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,360
understand that uh honestly truly no

925
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,320
cyber attack can

926
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,880
really ever be traced fully to its

927
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,480
source we can have very good clues

928
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,880
chinese source cause is a bit more

929
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,919
evident than than

930
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,880
others perhaps but still it's it's a

931
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,440
matter of

932
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,600
really a huge guessing game it's

933
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,120
sometimes a very good guess but it's

934
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,159
still a guessing game

935
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:50,000
and biggest challenges are still yet to

936
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,640
be seen uh we've started with this quote

937
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,279
from professor xiao labovich

938
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,279
computers don't release us from thinking

939
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,720
but from computing from calculating and

940
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,399
you know computers are really good in

941
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:05,360
answers i i argue that people are still

942
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,039
at least for the time being not always

943
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,200
but we're still good in asking questions

944
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,919
and i think we still have a thing or two

945
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:12,960
to offer

946
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,480
instead of the machines maybe there's a

947
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,000
computer somewhere around the world

948
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,320
that disagrees with me so i invite him

949
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,279
to to email me or send me some beacon

950
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:24,399
uh but really when you go out of here or

951
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:25,919
later in the day you think about what

952
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,679
you have in your pocket you know

953
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,000
your cell phone so ask yourself you know

954
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,360
what do you have in your pocket

955
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,960
is it a a thinker or a computer

956
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,799
because it's certainly not a camera with

957
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:39,279
benefit as it tries to tell you all the

958
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:40,559
time

959
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:47,279
thanks everybody see you later
