00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,219

you here today after five years of

17
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,969
running besides this is the first time

18
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:51,629
we're doing it in this format so what is

19
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:54,360
security besides all about anyway if

20
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,890
this is your first time at the b-sides

21
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,570
event I want to tell you a little bit

22
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,399
about the history of security besides

23
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,090
and the history of besides Tel Aviv so

24
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,880
security besides actually started a few

25
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,010
years ago on the other side of the world

26
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,860
all the way in Las Vegas that happened

27
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,590
11 years ago when a group of security

28
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,390
researchers couldn't find their voice

29
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,700
and their platform to speak their mind

30
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,340
to share their ideas to connect with the

31
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,799
community they felt like perhaps the

32
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,080
mainstream events of that time were not

33
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,810
suitable for a community security

34
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,450
research event for hackers and by

35
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,430
hackers so that was the idea for

36
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,350
security besides it's now a community

37
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,450
driven framework for events all over the

38
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,079
world and they've already been more than

39
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:42,360
500 security besides events from

40
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,509
anywhere to Australia to Brazil from

41
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:47,909
Switzerland to New York City and right

42
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:49,829
here in Tel Aviv of course this year

43
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:52,409
many security besides events are

44
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:54,630
switching gears they're turning it up

45
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,430
because of this new normal that we're

46
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,250
living in so about 30 events have moved

47
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,409
to a virtual format and we are happy to

48
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:05,310
be part of that virtual wave of besides

49
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,869
events hybrid events that allow people

50
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:09,119
to connect with our message 30 events

51
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,640
have decided to skip on 2020 and call it

52
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,780
a bust can't blame them for making that

53
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,180
and about 30 events have decided to

54
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,770
postpone to later in the year in the

55
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,750
hopes that we could have in-person

56
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,850
events ourselves the main security

57
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,920
besides that's taking place in Las Vegas

58
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,170
will only be taking place virtually but

59
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,070
not in person

60
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:29,500
so as I mentioned we started our event

61
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,050
2016 we were in a nice cosy room in Tel

62
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,760
Aviv University which has been our host

63
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,790
for all of our events until today and in

64
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,700
2019 last year was a massive event we

65
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,280
moved to a room that was twice the size

66
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,260
and was still not enough for all of our

67
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,970
amazing participants and audience

68
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,130
members what do we have lined up this

69
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:51,880
year well more than 1500 people have

70
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,100
signed up for besides Tel Aviv that is

71
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,200
amazing that is our biggest registration

72
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,540
number yet and it's exciting I don't

73
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,550
know how many of you are with us live

74
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:03,250
right now on the stream or via slack but

75
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,959
we will soon get those numbers in and we

76
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,250
will tell you how many people are

77
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,380
joining us in this online hybrid

78
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,620
experience we have 16 awesome speakers

79
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,500
including myself throughout the day with

80
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,230
talks demos we have special community

81
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,870
sessions we even have a yoga break but

82
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,049
more on that later we had 44 called for

83
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:25,299
papers submissions and we chose the best

84
00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:27,580
of the best of the best out of the

85
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,410
people that wanted to speak for us and

86
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:32,080
at the end we had to also bring together

87
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,600
some speakers in person some speakers

88
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,370
remotely and that's part of what makes

89
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,920
this a hybrid experience some of our

90
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,750
speakers are right here in the room with

91
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,600
me very far away safely but they're

92
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,230
right here

93
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:47,590
we had an amazing CTF each year we run

94
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,049
our CTF just before our event starts

95
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:52,450
this year the CTF took place earlier

96
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:56,350
this week we had almost elite number of

97
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,660
players I think we should kick some five

98
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,600
people off just so we get to 1337 if you

99
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,530
know what I'm talking about

100
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:05,200
however it was an amazing CTF a lot of

101
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,940
people chatted about it a lot of people

102
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,430
to share their experiences if you enjoy

103
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,799
capture-the-flag competitions you can

104

stay home and stay safe which is the

151
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,550
most important part of running our event

152
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,930
this year it was the most important

153
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:04,089
important decision what we had to make

154
00:06:04,089 --> 00:06:06,099
how do we keep our event going but make

155
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,169

that does not conform to our code of

337
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,350

00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:08,110
it

345
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,150
now I mentioned our sponsors and they

346
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,700

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,620
before I turn it over to our next

351
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,490
speaker

352
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:22,750
I also want to share with you my own

353
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,480
personal opinion about why this event is

354
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,820
so important and why we put so much

355
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,640
energy into making it happen with this

356
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,800
current crisis with the situation that's

357
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,810
going on around the world it has changed

358
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,670
everybody's life it has made things

359
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:39,250
difficult complex people are dealing

360
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,260
with adversity they're dealing with

361
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,990
illness they're dealing with job losses

362
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:47,350
this is a moment like no other in the

363
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:50,440
history of humanity and I I know I just

364
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,970
said something that sounds like a cliche

365
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:54,520
but it's truly unprecedented in terms of

366
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,500
how the world is dealing with this

367
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,550
current pandemic

368
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,260
yes we've dealt with different pandemics

369
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,270
before but this is the 21st century and

370
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:03,910
we live in a more global and connected

371
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,250
era than ever before this is why I

372
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,160
believe that the statement we say each

373
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,310
year at besides is even truer than ever

374
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,649
before with great power comes great

375
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:17,860
responsibility and that means as hackers

376
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:21,550
we have to step up and be that immune

377
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:24,520
system in the digital age that we've

378
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,230
been speaking about for so many years

379
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,300
this is why this year we decided to

380
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,360
include a special session about the CGI

381
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,339
League which is an amazing initiative

382
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,290
with volunteers from all over the world

383
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:37,029
and founders from all over the world

384
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:38,980
including one of them here in Israel who

385
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,750
will join us this afternoon to talk

386
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,390
about how hackers are helping medical

387
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:45,100
institutions and healthcare

388
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,079
organizations that are being actively

389
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:49,630
targeted by criminals trying to profit

390
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,760
from this pandemic that is something

391
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,160
that as friendly hackers should not

392
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,339
allow to happen we should provide those

393
00:14:57,339 --> 00:14:59,170
healthcare professionals all the help

394
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:01,029
and virtual support that they need at

395
00:15:01,029 --> 00:15:03,220
least the least we can do is defend them

396
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,570
from criminals that are trying to profit

397
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,060
from this situation so this is a moment

398
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:10,060
in time where the corona virus and the

399
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,620
kovat crisis has changed all our lives

400
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,470
and it can be quite challenging we feel

401
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:16,420
like we're at home alone sometimes and

402
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,300
home is our new office it's also a new

403
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,510
yoga studio our new school our new

404
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,490
entertainment center and it can feel

405
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,380
quite challenging when you're all alone

406
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,570
you're meeting people through video like

407
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,490
you're meeting me right now and we know

408
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:32,800
that it's not enough this is why we

409
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,760
really worked so hard to make this event

410
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,710
reality because we want to keep this

411
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:40,010
community connected now more than ever

412
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,080
before yes it's a challenge

413
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,510
yes we're all working and maintaining

414
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,430
our families and adapting to this new

415
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,830
life to this new normal and sometimes it

416
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,780
feels all we have to keep us company is

417
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,450
the dozens of digital devices that we

418
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:55,850
have in our homes or you know maybe we

419
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,800
have our families and our pets and

420
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,970
that's fantastic

421
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,890
but we all need a little bit more we all

422
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:03,110
need community which is what decides Tel

423
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:06,410
Aviv is all about I know that life has

424
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:08,300
become complex I know that we're all

425
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,760
defending our personal digital republics

426
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,130
and personal space when we're out there

427
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:15,670
in the world we know it's not easy and

428
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:18,410
sometimes it feels like we are now on

429
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,750
the frontlines in virtual space but also

430
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,030
in the physical world as people that

431
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,950
have to defend ourselves and to help our

432
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,080
families dealing with all of this is not

433
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,810
easy and we cannot you know let that

434
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:31,460
slide we understand it's complicated

435
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,740
this is why today we also wanted to talk

436
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,390
about that a little bit we wanted to

437
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:38,030
invite you to use this event to use this

438
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,720
opportunity for a reset a reset of how

439
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,660
you're thinking a renaissance if you

440
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:47,240
will an opportunity to adapt to this new

441
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,670
normal to make new connections maybe

442
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,770
even find your next job we are also

443
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:54,380
going to have a yoga session to allow

444
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,480
you an opportunity to move a little bit

445
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,730
to stretch it out a little bit I invited

446
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:01,310
my personal amazing yoga teacher to

447
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,960
besides in order to share that with you

448
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,150
because for me having my family close

449
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,510
during yoga and keeping plants has kept

450
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:11,000
me sort of saying throughout the past

451
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,040
couple of months so that's why we also

452
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,470
have these amazing plants here they're

453
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,270
not just for props they're actually

454
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,949
going to be our speaker gifts this year

455
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:22,459
alongside a very cool work from home kit

456
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:25,250
so do some yoga get some plants we're

457
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,740
gonna have a yoga break later on I hope

458
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,840
we can take this opportunity opportunity

459
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,850
to look into the future and see some

460
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:35,420
amazing optimism possibilities and hope

461
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,240
for all of us and by staying connected I

462
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,640
believe and I hope that we can make that

463
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,820
a reality I think that's what that's

464
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:47,210
what besides tel aviv is all about now I

465
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:48,590
want to introduce our

466
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,770
yes he's a very very special person

467
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,000
before I do that let me just put this

468
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,990
plant away so I don't drop it again and

469
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:58,640
we know that this new normal is not easy

470
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,620
but we think that today can be a

471
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,900
fantastic opportunity to stay connected

472
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,940
with one another so I'm very very

473
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,100
