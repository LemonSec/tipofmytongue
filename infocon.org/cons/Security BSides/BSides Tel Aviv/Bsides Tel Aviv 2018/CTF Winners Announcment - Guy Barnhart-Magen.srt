1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,689
how many over here try this again do you

2
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:04,350
love it

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,770
was it one of the best ETFs ever

4
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:09,240
possibly the best CTF in the galaxy

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:15,680
let's hear it from guy test us amazing

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,180
co-organizer this year and CPF please

7
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,740
okay thank you very much I hope you can

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,500
hear me we had a pretty amazing CBF this

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,330
year and I want to do a couple of things

10
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,430
and then the end and he acknowledged the

11
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,300
winners I'm saying I'm not the only one

12
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,680
saying that is probably one of the best

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,079
ETFs in Israel and it was amazing out of

14
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:46,050
several different aspects we had nine

15
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,730
different members on the city F team

16
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,469
I'll go through the names a bit later so

17
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:51,239
you know who to blame for their favorite

18
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:52,890
miss challenge

19
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,870
we ran somewhere between three to five

20
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,360
different servers just to keep everybody

21
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,520
up and happy and who still had crashes

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,430
we had 19 different challenges in total

23
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,619
ranging from something ridiculously easy

24
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:08,820
to something outrageous ly hard and we

25
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,159
spread out the challenges over two weeks

26
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,080
more or less with new challenges being

27
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,310
added every other day on average Sundays

28
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,020
to Wednesday's to 30 days more or less

29
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,229
so we can give people enough time to go

30
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:23,909
over the challenges and rack the points

31
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:26,400
this was not the regular city effort you

32
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,500
have 48 hours to finish as many

33
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,240
challenges that you can it was all a

34
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,950
more like a city of Marathon where you

35
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,409
had to crack the most difficult

36
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:36,060
challenges in order to get those points

37
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,979
and possibly get to the end of the

38
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:41,280
winner so first of all we love feedback

39
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,470
come find us come talk to us tell us how

40
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,990
the CDF went how we felt about it this

41
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,119
little shiny medal each member of the

42
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:49,890
CTF team is wearing one so you know

43
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,990
exactly who to capture in a very dark

44
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,960
corner but let us know what you felt

45
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,119
about it I just want to share quickly a

46
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,310
couple of the different feedbacks that

47
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,780
we received a over the CBF some of them

48
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,130
are in Hebrew some of them are in

49
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:09,568
English we will do write-ups or works

50
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:11,560
easily we will share those right up

51
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,959
I do want to take time to point out that

52
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,170
this specific challenge WTF lol I will

53
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,630
not spell it out for you it was

54
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,400
especially hard and we had some issues

55
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,840
with it I'll come back to it later and

56
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,000
we were very happy they had a lot of

57
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,640
people found the challenge of themselves

58
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,610
well challenging or at least something

59
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,230
that would keep them up at night trying

60
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,319
to get the next flag sometimes there are

61
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:44,019
more than one flag and specifically some

62
00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:45,940
of the people playing games there for

63
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,350
God that we're actually running the

64
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,330
servers so they started chatting with

65
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,200
each other each other over /dev / TTY

66
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,610
forgetting that we're owning the server

67
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:55,840
and actually looking at what they're

68
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,390
doing they started chatting and started

69
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,920
to share information over the server

70
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,209
that was pretty funny and you know it

71
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:07,299
was very fun to write very fun to run

72
00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:10,420
and very fun to host it but in the end

73
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,819
what we care about is that we created

74
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:13,780
something that brings the community

75
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,239
together and brings people an

76
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,660
opportunity to play in a high order game

77
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,880
a capture the flag in the end is just a

78
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,530
game you've solved the riddles you get

79
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,660
the flag you capture the points this is

80
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,560
it and we love the feedback and I do

81
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,209
want to give a lot of credit to the team

82
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:32,799
who built it and a lot of credit to the

83
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,459
teams that spent so many hours trying to

84
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:40,239
solve that CDF and specifically to

85
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,500
Thomas Wright who

86
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,980
former more than anyone else has spit

87
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,310
blood has sweated tears to get that City

88
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:57,069
off of the ground and I want to show you

89
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:58,660
a bit of what happened behind the scenes

90
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,000
we had a lot of challenges without a lot

91
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,330
of obscure names a lot of interesting

92
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:06,790
things that went behind the scenes so I

93
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,410
wrote them down so it would be very

94
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,330
obvious to all of you who you need to

95
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:16,358
blame for each of your pains and some of

96
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:18,070
these challenges were ridiculously easy

97
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,500
I'm in charge of one of the most

98
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,880
ridiculous challenges ever

99
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,919
so that was 50 points and if somebody

100
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,720
hasn't tried it out you showed it to

101
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,570
take you like one minute and we also

102
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,729
encountered some funny things along the

103
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:33,010
way like having challenges building them

104
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,389
out thinking that they're going to be

105
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:36,639
extremely hard and then some hackers

106
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,080
finding a different way to do it in

107
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,669
under two hours that was really

108
00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:42,430
disappointing so but we learn from it

109
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:46,360
and we try to improve ourselves and the

110
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,690
challenges for the rest we also had an

111
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,760
issue with one of our challenges where a

112
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,160
flag was leaked and shared and we

113
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,669
handled it as best we could

114
00:04:56,669 --> 00:05:00,190
transparently and in general we didn't

115
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,150
want to hurt the capture the flag

116
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,130
contest itself on the other hand we

117
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,600
couldn't keep a challenge where a flag

118
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,229
was freely shared over telegram and we

119
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:09,550
didn't want to kick anybody out of the

120
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,900
contest as we believed that they did

121
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,340
this as an honest mistake

122
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:16,900
both the person who wrote the flag for

123
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,720
his blog and the other person who saw

124
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,910
the blog and god effect just wanted to

125
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:24,910
test it out so we didn't disqualify

126
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:27,190
anyone in the end this is just a game

127
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,479
but it's something that we need to

128
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,460
consider when we're playing this game to

129
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:34,180
keep some of the rules at least we had a

130
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,510
very dedicated SOC NIT teams that is Oh

131
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:41,350
Mel and Tamela the kind of rhymes so

132
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,660
Omar isn't here today unfortunately he's

133
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,460
traveling somewhere over Vietnam I think

134
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,830
at the moment but yeah that's we had

135
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:50,229
24-hour follow-the-sun IT service

136
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:51,880
because when we were asleep Omer was

137
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,080
thinking things in Thailand timezone but

138
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,150
in the end keeping the challenge running

139
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,230
is

140
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,840
a problem and but it's something that we

141
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,270
need to do in order to get the game with

142
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:07,630
low latency with responsive servers with

143
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,910
non crashing docker services with

144
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:12,240
servers that don't run out of Rams

145
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,150
repeatedly and just to share some

146
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:20,110
statistics we had 312 teams registered

147
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:22,750
for the contest I think it's one of the

148
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,200
most the the highest played CTF in

149
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,680
Israel ever but when I looked at the

150
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,000
data I didn't want to say just how many

151
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,650
people signed up for the challenge I

152
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,150
want to know how many people actually

153
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:36,070
played the challenge and we had a

154
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,020
hundred hundred twelve different teams

155
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,270
who solved at least one challenge so I

156
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,700
think this is a beautiful turnout over a

157
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,350
thousand different unique IP address to

158
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,240
anybody thought we weren't looking at we

159
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,420
were looking at them and just looking at

160
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,310
the solve cons you can quickly see which

161
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,010
was the easiest challenge over there and

162
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:56,710
what was ridiculously hard this is the

163
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:59,140
challenge that we canceled so these were

164
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:02,530
ridiculously hard and some of them were

165
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:07,450
just as hard as others and also that a

166
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,420
lot of people were able to solve the

167
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,800
more run-of-the-mill CTS but the more

168
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,610
specialized CDF's took a lot more time

169
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:17,380
now I want to discuss briefly the

170
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:20,140

187
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,000
the non herbal mention okay so Adam he's

188
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,460
a researcher for working for his

189
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,140
Imperium actually won the first place

190
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,630
but one of our rules and the reason for

191
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,860
that world's we wanted to share with the

192
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,960
community and he's based in Amsterdam

193
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,600
and we have a rule that while we opened

194
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,670
the contest for any remote team to play

195
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,830
because we think it's fun you have to be

196
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,440
present on stage to win the prize so all

197
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,650
kudos to Adam for being unable to play

198
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,660
the CDF but the first pressed

199
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,830
first-place prize goes through reclass
