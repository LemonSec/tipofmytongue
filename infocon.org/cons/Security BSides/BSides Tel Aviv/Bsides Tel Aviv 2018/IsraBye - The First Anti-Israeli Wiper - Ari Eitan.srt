1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,389
the Pecha Kucha is a special turbo talk

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:06,750
it is only seven minutes long and each

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,139
slide is going to auto advance which

4
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:20,460
means one moment sorry but it's okay

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,859
anyway this is a challenge for both us

6
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:25,199
as organizers and for you to audience

7
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,420
but most of all it's a challenging talk

8
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,250
for our speaker because all of the

9
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,439
slides are going to Auto advance that

10
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,230
means he doesn't get that mean Thank You

11
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,270
Stefan it doesn't means that our new

12
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,670
speaker re8 on who is awesome and we

13
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,160
love our returned speakers so thank you

14
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,760
re for returning to besides elevated

15
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,550
check out check out his shirt the

16
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,670
vintage 2016 original besides Tel Aviv

17
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,789
Edition now nowhere to be found even not

18
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:55,710
on eBay you cannot get one shirt like

19
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,559
this and now REI I'm gonna leave you to

20
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,960
do this amazing thing which is the Pecha

21
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,019
Kucha challenge before that I'll wait to

22
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,010
have a whiskey okay

23
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:23,470
I'll just tell you why then here we go

24
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:27,320
so hi everyone my name is Ellie and I'm

25
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,539
the VP of research at integer it's great

26
00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:32,330
to be once again like Aaron said in this

27
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,549
Pacha Kucha I will talk about Israel by

28
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:37,210
which is the first anti Israeli wiper

29
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,649
today I would like to present the story

30
00:01:39,649 --> 00:01:42,850
and significance of this specific mode

31
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:46,850
so let's start last August I got my

32
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,709
hands on a very interesting marvelous

33
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:51,170
sample the malware itself wasn't very

34
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,490
sophisticated

35
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:54,860
but since it involved Israel by the

36
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:57,140
Hebrew encryption message and as you can

37
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,179
see and here I'm Israeli it really

38
00:01:59,179 --> 00:02:03,170
attracted my attention after quick

39
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:05,840
investigation I quickly came to the

40
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,450
conclusion that it's the first

41
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,919
anti-israel and pro-palestinian data

42
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,769
wiper which called Israel by without

43
00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:15,290
causing damage to Israeli victims Israel

44
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,660
I also try to deliver some kind of

45
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,620
political message for those of you who

46
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,640
are not familiar with wipers it's a type

47
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,340
of model with the intention of wiping

48
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,350
the hard drive of the computer it in

49
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,790
fact an icon somewhere where you can

50
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:36,650
allegedly recover your files if you pay

51
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:40,900
in this case the files are gone forever

52
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,519
Israel I was spotted shortly after a

53
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,010
political incident between the Jewish

54
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,109
and our people in Jerusalem magno met

55
00:02:48,109 --> 00:02:51,170
him usually after incidents like this we

56
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:54,200
see more activity in social media such

57
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,139
as Facebook and Twitter but this time

58
00:02:57,139 --> 00:02:59,959
they try to convey the message across

59
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:04,040
the cyberspace landscape the agenda of

60
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,920
the author of Israel by wasn't meant to

61
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,709
be undetected at all he hates Israel and

62
00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:12,620
the Israeli people based on the messages

63
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:15,650
inside the Viper he believes that the

64
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,389
Palestinians should have full control

65
00:03:17,389 --> 00:03:18,569
over Jerusalem

66
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:21,659
you see it now back to cyber normal

67
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:26,040
politics about the morrow itself as you

68
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,709
can see it's written all in seashell so

69
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,079
for us it's very easy to analyze and

70
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:33,480
understand the code the issue by wiper

71
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,760
is modular which means that instead of

72
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,500
having all the malicious code in one

73
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,500
executable it spread its functionality

74
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,920
between five different executables so

75
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,620
what does it do

76
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,700
first it changes the background of your

77
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,430
computer to this scary photo

78
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,400
besides the Byrne Israeli flags it has

79
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,859
messages in Arabic with the translation

80
00:03:55,859 --> 00:03:58,049
of get out of the Palestinian land from

81
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:00,510
the sea to the river Palestine is not

82
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,180
for sale and so on you can imagine the

83
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,530
rest after that it changes the mouse

84
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:11,069
cursor to this picture the end of Israel

85
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:13,290
photo which follows any way you move it

86
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,168
on the actual screen and it also starts

87
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:18,418
playing some Arabic music in the

88
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:22,620
background which I'm going to speak next

89
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,590
it opens the window with Hebrew and

90
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,360
English messages about the files this is

91
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,180
it the messages say you will get them

92
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,729
after Palestine will be free and sure

93
00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:35,909
you can recover your files well the last

94
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:37,710
sentence is alive because like I said in

95
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,389
this case we're dealing with the wiper

96
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:42,870
and not on someone and now for the best

97
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:45,259
part in my opinion the wiping part

98
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:48,630
rather than encrypting the files is why

99
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,220
we change the content of the actual

100
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,159
files to Israel the username you

101
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,599
will never recover your files until

102
00:04:54,599 --> 00:04:57,360
Israel disappear and the disappeared

103
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,479
typo is original remember that because

104
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:05,310
we'll go back to it later on now

105
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:08,400
surprisingly the motto has some evasion

106
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,740
techniques it looked for processes like

107
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,960
pauses sake task manager and process

108
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,810
Explorer and just terminates them if

109
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,000
they're being detected but this doesn't

110
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,130
mean that we're dealing with some kind

111
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:25,050
of an advanced threat so I tweeted about

112
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,090
the malware this is it which become

113
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:29,190
viral got a lot of retweets

114
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,960
bleeping computer wrote a full article

115
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,040
about it actually

116
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,230
including my tweet and they even created

117
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,720
the demo video of an infected machine

118
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,610
where you can see them all in action

119
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:42,480
wiping the files and now for the bugs in

120
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,360
the malware it's important to say that

121
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,030
the programming level of the mauville

122
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,610
was not high at all technically speaking

123
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,950
like I said was written in C sharp and

124
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,230
all the other executables were included

125
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,210
in the resource section of the main P

126
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:59,220
and by the name of each whistle you can

127
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,470
understand what it does a curve for

128
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:04,380
changing the cursor for example now

129
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,470
another thing the model doesn't even

130
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,810
wipe the entire files like it should the

131
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,430
files that are stored in the desktop and

132
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,500
downloads folders are being wiped but

133
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,990
five-toed in other folders such as

134
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,480
Program Files they just stay without any

135
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:27,780
change at all so pretty fail ok the name

136
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,300
Israel by is not our idea actually but

137
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,820
the name the author gave it we know it

138
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,130
because we've detected a PDB pass in the

139
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:37,110
far away as you can see and we can see

140
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,330
the original name of the project we can

141
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,160
even see the username who created it in

142
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,500
this case it's Ahmed yeah and if that's

143
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,330
not enough then you don't know from

144
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,180
Kaspersky great I found a way to make it

145
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,120
crash the Maori tries to copy itself to

146
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,610
a specific folder and it turns out that

147
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,350
if a file is already exists in this

148
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,870
exact path the malware crashes and

149
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:05,060
without conducting any damage hello

150
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,240
yeah now remember the typo there are new

151
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,910
samples of visual bye at first I created

152
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,440
the Yahoo signature based on the

153
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,660
disappear typo and I was able to find a

154
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,270
new sample the author's recompile the

155
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,760
source code and now the PDB path has

156
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,580
been removed but besides that all the

157
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,250
major bugs that I just showed out still

158
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:30,110
in them so what do we learn from it

159
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,940
mostly that it's probably easy to write

160
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,890
a model as you can see especially using

161
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:38,700
C sharp or Java and to use it to push

162
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,130
and promote your agenda but as you can

163
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:44,460
see it's probably not that easy to make

164
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,370
it work perfect

165
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:49,750
and without any bugs at all and this is

166
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,190
it thank you very much

167
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:55,620
[Applause]
