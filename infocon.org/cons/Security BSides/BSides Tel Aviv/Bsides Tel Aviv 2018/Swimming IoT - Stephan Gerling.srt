00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,280
the microphone is yeah it's on let me

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:23,259
check the sound control we need the

5
00:00:23,259 --> 00:00:26,220
computer sound thank you

6
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,439
it's the second slide and then then it's

7
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:40,780
okay okay okay here we go okay yeah so

8
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,670
it's now up to me to enjoy you a little

9
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:46,570
bit about hacking yachts and what can go

10
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:47,469
wrong with that

11
00:00:47,469 --> 00:00:50,710
so yeah I call it Jen swimming IOT

12
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,809
because well it's just like an IOT

13
00:00:52,809 --> 00:00:56,109
device and to get in small overview

14
00:00:56,109 --> 00:01:00,760
about it that's always the clicker is

15
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:10,390
not working now it's not switched on I I

16
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:14,159
use it by hand it's okay

17
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,200
this one is better yes okay thank you

18
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:23,619
Karen yeah because I know Karen loves it

19
00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:31,229
yeah the sound is missing come on

20
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:35,320
replicates till it overloads a file than

21
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,110
it spreads like cancer cancer you have

22
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:40,829
to get parent

23
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:54,520
[Music]

24
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,720
it's the Gibson it's finding us too fast

25
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,670
[Music]

26
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:10,889
[Music]

27
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,580
there's too many garbage files I need

28
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,030
more time

29
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,170
yeah I think we should watch the

30
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,290
complete movie but yeah we want to hear

31
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,870
a little bit more about chips so yeah

32
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:33,629
hack the planet who am i and we hear

33
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:36,810
something about yachts and ships we have

34
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,629
to start with a marina one by one so

35
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:41,310
that you'd get an idea about what kind

36
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,069
of systems are on an ship or in yacht

37
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:47,819
and how they interact between and then

38
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:49,140
you get an understanding about what

39
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,769
attack vectors you have on the boat and

40
00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:54,569
we see already here and the different

41
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:56,700
attack vectors then how you can look up

42
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,400
your targets which kind of security bugs

43
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,260
you can find in some of those routers we

44
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,530
make a sneak preview in SATCOM boxes

45
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:10,019
where are found also some nice stuff and

46
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:22,010
then at the end yes okay

47
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:25,500
so as you already know my name is Kevin

00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:36,750
certified yeah I have many of those I'm

51
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,630
an electronic specialist worked several

52
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,910
years for the German army a army has a

53
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,650
navigation system specialists for

54
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:47,549

56
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:52,980
firefighter I do it in my spare time I'm

57
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,760
a security evangelist in our company

58
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,639
taking care about all those stuffs

59
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:01,769
something about security also so we work

60
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:03,989
in the oil and gas industry and making

61
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:06,329
normally pipeline services so we

62
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:09,959
inspecting oil and gas pipelines and in

63
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:13,260
our newest branch the cert evasion there

64
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,840
we do also some pen testing security

65
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,988
audits and so on of course also for

66
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:21,269
vessels yes

67
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:24,479
avoid guarantees member of Gaddafi and

68
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:30,670
I'm the cavalry here we are

69
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,620
what happened last year so so many

70
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,670
newspapers about attacks against yachts

71
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:41,810
and systems and GPS and so on made it in

72
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:47,120
the news and that West was also some

73
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,160
kind of their idea to look a little bit

74
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,860
more on that stuff

75
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,980
the initial idea about that was I was

76
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,770
building up an Internet router into an

77
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:00,620
into a yacht so it was three weeks

78
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,330
working on in your to build up some

79
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:05,360
stuff there built up the internet router

80
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,910
the cabling the antennas on the monkey

81
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,970
island and and so on and after

82
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,810
everything was finished I was

83
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,550
introducing the captain how the system

84
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,130
was working and at the same time we're

85
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:21,140
drinking a bottle of wine and I started

86
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,460
my Wireshark and to looking what the

87
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,890
applications are doing while I was in

88
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:29,210
teaching and after we finished I had a

89
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:31,880
faith pound because I can't believe what

90
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,670
the application was doing and we will

91
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:37,760
see it later so these are only some

92
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:42,740
newspapers here are a short overview

93
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,290
about it so in February last year we had

94
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:47,720
in container vessel some area in a

95
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,220
pirate area they had no access to their

96
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,540
navigation system anymore for ten hours

97
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,850
so they had to shut down their systems

98
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:58,940
and rebooted that the navigation system

99
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:03,110
was working again in September last year

100
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:05,780
we had GPS jamming from the eastern

101
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:10,070
direction so in Norway they reported

102
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:15,860
some jamming in a GPS by planes and then

103
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,740
they started with an helicopter was in

104
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,900
with a beacon antenna and then they

105
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,090
localized from which direction the

106
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:26,000
jamming came it came so and then they

107
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,410
figured out okay it comes from the

108
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:30,290
eastern direction could be Russian could

109
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:33,770
be Ukraine somewhere in that area so

110
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,510
just only know it's a eastern direction

111
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:39,890
and the US Navy had last year for

112
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:42,050
accidents with their warships

113
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,660
and when you think about hey a warship

114
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:48,530
should have the best people on board the

115
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:50,479
best navigator on board and so on but

116
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,900
they crashed with a there was also a big

117
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,789
container vessels and so on and yeah

118
00:06:57,789 --> 00:07:02,300
that happens so in some reports ivory

119
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05,210
cam they claimed that all the time it

120
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:09,319
was a human error because they did not

121
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:11,389
follow the instruction about how to

122
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:15,400
navigate also in night hours so they are

123
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,620
not enough people on the bridge and they

124
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,979
not following the rules about navigation

125
00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:24,740
but after these crashes after they had

126
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,639
four of them

127
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:28,669
the room was caming up could it be a

128
00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:33,650
cyber attack if it was a cyber track we

129
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,840
don't know the official statement is not

130
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,360
the official the official statement was

131
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:43,300
a human error okay now we go into the

132
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,990
terms of vessels yachts and ships a

133
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:54,199
yacht is an a small boat or ship and it

134
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:58,009
comes from the Dutch word yacht and yeah

135
00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:00,919
in Dutch means something like hunting so

136
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:03,560
it's an antique boat for pirates in the

137
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,800
shallow water of the Dutch countries in

138
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,460
the past so that terms then the yeah

139
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,889
that created now the terms for yeah

140
00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:17,479
and nowadays a yacht is an recreational

141
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:19,190
boat or sporting boat or something like

142
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:19,659
that

143
00:08:19,659 --> 00:08:25,840
and of course size matters as always

144
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,699
we're talking about a boat when we have

145
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:31,880
smaller than seven meters when we have

146
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,799
already a more than 10 meters we haven't

147
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:36,620
yacht we have an super yacht when we

148
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,950
going above 24 meters and we're talking

149
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:42,740
about a mega yacht when we have more

150
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:46,820
than 50 meters so here is a sample of

151
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:50,720
them it's a picture of the German trash

152
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,670
TV serious the guys ins it's there

153
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:59,070
IndyGo star boat it's in 1996 one model

154
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:02,080
30 meters about that it's a super yacht

155
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:07,390
and yeah it looks nice it works

156
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:12,520
I have not enough money for that but

157
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,240
it's those class of now when we're

158
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,940
talking about yachts above 30 meters and

159
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,700
you have already very very nice one even

160
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:25,540
if there are old what I have on board

161
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,790
everything so this is a complete list

162
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:32,470
about stuff that is what I have on board

163
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:37,630
there so we have vessel traffic services

164
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:40,260
so it's like like air traffic services

165
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:44,070
where they a traffic controller is

166
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:47,350
giving position to the aircraft and says

167
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:51,640
ok you have to fly level 300 in that

168
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,360
direction the same system you have for

169
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,540
ships mostly in harbors so that the

170
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,700
vessel traffic services provider then

171
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,070
saying okay this is your cross this is

172
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,570
your speed that you have to drive and

173
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,480
then everyone in the harbor are

174
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,040
maneuvering in a right direction

175
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,820
they provided by this automatic

176
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:17,260
identification system also out pilots

177
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:22,000
GPS rada cameras including also

178
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,810
thermal-imaging cameras we have engine

179
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:28,270
control and monitoring systems nowadays

180
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:31,750
some of them are also cloud-based we

181
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,330
hear it later we have internet access on

182
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,940
board in different ways and we have some

183
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,190
kind of entertainment systems with smart

184
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:44,710
TVs and whatever all those devices of

185
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:48,190
that you need for the navigation or for

186
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:51,310
the boat controlling it's connected over

187
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:55,290
an enemy a bus so it's in serial bus

188
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:57,460
standards eyes under the National Marine

189
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:01,150
associated as a so Asian it's an enemy

190
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,790
zero one eight three that's the term for

191
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:07,990
that and this is a serial bus so

192
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:13,780
the speeders are about 4,800 bout so you

193
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,910
cannot transmit so many information over

194
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:19,420
that you they are connecting mostly echo

195
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:23,190
Sounders sonars animators gyrocompass

196
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:26,470
autopilot GPS receivers and some other

197
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:30,540
instruments like temperature or whatever

198
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:34,210
then because of they need some faster

199
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,880
things they have introduced the enemy a

200
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,180
2000 here we are already in the

201
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:45,130
bandwidth of one megabit it's not a

202
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:47,890
serial protocol anymore in this case we

203
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:51,370
have now an technology like in the car

204
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:54,460
industry so it's in canvas so they

205
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:57,940
losing also the same cabling standards

206
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:02,290
so we have a can low can die and the

207
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:05,130
power over the bus and that's it and

208
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:08,110
it's everything is standardized under

209
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:12,310
the enemy are 2000 and you can buy those

210
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:15,280
standardization of reports about and how

211
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:20,190
it works in from the enemy association

212
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:23,620
so this is how it looks like so it's

213
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:26,290
incomplete bus I think here is Eliza

214
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:28,570
it's incomplete bus from front to the

215
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:32,410
end of the ship and all the devices are

216
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:35,440
connected here together so here we have

217
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:41,170
an enemy r1 near 0 a 1 a 3 device ends

218
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,920
connected with an Gateway that's

219
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,750
converting the serial bus to enemy on

220
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,090
bus and we have also here gateways that

221
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:52,510
connecting to other these devices here

222
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:56,850
like displays or computers and so on

223
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,810
this is how it looks in real so it looks

224
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:03,520
more like a cheaper net in the older

225
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:07,720
days where some of them as here already

226
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:13,030
worked with here we have an another term

227
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:16,510
for that the enemy are 2000 is also

228
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:19,460
available as si tog ng

229
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:23,510
and this is 10 now in a brand name of

230
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,760
Raymarine so it's rain marinas one

231
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,200
Wender of these marine stuff and as you

232
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,210
can hear see you see all those devices

233
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:35,089
that you can see on ships on the bridge

234
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:40,760
on anywhere there and you and network

235
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,100
that I have this is some kind of ether

236
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,400
Network and they call it an see talk ha

237
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,360
ha ha

238
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,010
HS it's a high speed so it's a we're

239
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,410
about 10 megabit that they have on

240
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:57,680
traffic and you can already see that

241
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,310
horizon multimedia display where you can

242
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:06,620
also display videos and those stuff when

243
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:09,410
we tear down now the network how it

244
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:13,220
looks like then we see all those stuffs

245
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,529
here like we have here the internet

246
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:17,960
router the internet internet router here

247
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,830
this is a how they connected here's some

248
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:23,870
access points we have some mobile

249
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:26,510
devices we have computers on the normal

250
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:29,570
network then we have some converters

251
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:32,209
that converting the enemy and network to

252
00:14:32,209 --> 00:14:35,390
the tcp/ip Network it could be oven USB

253
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,550
device with a laptop it could also be a

254
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,470
native device that's directly connected

255
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:42,860
to lead to the computer network and here

256
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,230
below we have all the systems connected

257
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:49,730
over this canvas so this we have to

258
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:51,620
remember that all those devices are

259
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:55,160
connected via this bus and they have

260
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,990
connections over those gateways to

261
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:02,870
normal ones we will see later why why it

262
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:08,120
is important so the marine electronic in

263
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,459
the overview we had already these vessel

264
00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:13,459
traffic services the AIS system the

265
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:16,089
actus electronic chart display an

266
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:18,980
information system and autopilot and

267
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:23,029
internet access so the vessel traffic

268
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:27,560
services it is yeah like this air

269
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,579
traffic controller system by our and

270
00:15:31,579 --> 00:15:33,059
port authorities

271
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:37,649
and using radar CCTV VHF travel

272
00:15:37,649 --> 00:15:42,149
telephony and the AIS system so this we

273
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:45,239
have to remember the vgs is using the a

274
00:15:45,239 --> 00:15:51,569
is the a is is the automatic

275
00:15:51,569 --> 00:15:56,009
identification system and it's for

276
00:15:56,009 --> 00:15:59,869
tracking those devices and it's

277
00:15:59,869 --> 00:16:03,569
transmitting the you had a ship named

278
00:16:03,569 --> 00:16:06,749
the course the speed the heading and so

279
00:16:06,749 --> 00:16:10,199
on and it's mostly over VHF radio it

280
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:12,529
could also be over satellite

281
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:19,549
so the vgs is using the a is so das

282
00:16:19,549 --> 00:16:24,869
information using gps for the

283
00:16:24,869 --> 00:16:32,879
positioning yeah and it also supporting

284
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:37,199
the the movie nevada so the the that's

285
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,599
coming now in the next one so the

286
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:41,489
electronic chap display an information

287
00:16:41,489 --> 00:16:45,589
system the actors this one is displaying

288
00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:48,299
like navigation system in the car here

289
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:50,639
you have two waterways and here you then

290
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,369
will see all the ships that a is

291
00:16:53,369 --> 00:16:57,149
information are submitted remember that

292
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:59,249
the a is is getting the information from

293
00:16:59,249 --> 00:17:01,889
the GPS system and and so on so

294
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:04,709
everything tears down back to the gps

295
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:06,839
system and all the devices are

296
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:10,079
interconnected over those canvas so just

297
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:14,909
keep in mind it integrates positioning

298
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:17,009
information the position the heading and

299
00:17:17,009 --> 00:17:19,319
the speed and it's submitting also the

300
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:23,368
information to other devices and the

301
00:17:23,368 --> 00:17:25,849
last thing that we have on board is then

302
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:30,570
the IT equipment so IT equipment we have

303
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:34,169
also at home in this case we have yeah

304
00:17:34,169 --> 00:17:37,679
internet access any how it could be over

305
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,169
GSM it could be over Wi-Fi it could pull

306
00:17:40,169 --> 00:17:41,040
over

307
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:47,070
in Mossad VZ iridium or whatever and on

308
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:49,320
board we have also entertainment systems

309
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,790
we have Wi-Fi

310
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:54,950
we have voice over IP and what else

311
00:17:54,950 --> 00:18:02,070
whatever so this is a picture of it was

312
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:04,620
a 40 meter yacht where I was working on

313
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:08,880
and that is complete 19-inch rack a full

314
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,070
high completely equipped with IT staff

315
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:16,230
so here we have the internet router very

316
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:20,180
small one we have here three servers a

317
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:23,220
three 19 inch rack servers mounted to

318
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:26,550
the system we have here - voiceover IP

319
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:30,480
gateways we see later why we haven't

320
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,000
fully equipped switch and we have a new

321
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,360
PS power supply and when we then look

322
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,510
what else is on the board you see that

323
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:42,150
there are 10 smart TVs and satellite

324
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:45,150
receivers and we have one char PC for

325
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:49,050
the for the navigation system we have 14

326
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:50,850
voice over IP telephones we have an

327
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:52,410
Internet router we have rack mounted

328
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:55,100
switch ups for Wi-Fi access points

329
00:18:55,100 --> 00:19:00,960
etcetera etcetera so many IT staff and

330
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,770
all load staff is used to connect those

331
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:09,210
devices together so you can stream audio

332
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,040
and video from the multimedia

333
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,260
entertainment system you can use your

334
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:18,150
iPod iPhone or your computer to stream

335
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:21,600
videos and sound you can control the

336
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,720
light scenes of the ship you can close

337
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,120
the electric curtains of the ship and

338
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,480
you can also control the engine motor or

339
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,970
display the engine status here on this

340
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:35,220
display so these are all screenshots

341
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,290
from from an iPad where you can do all

342
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:39,210
those things for us so this is the

343
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:42,200
current control this is the light scene

344
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,880
this is the engine control system and

345
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:50,100
yeah multimedia so if we see now this

346
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,990
stuff all together

347
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,910
and we come into the different attack

348
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:57,180
vectors so we can attack it over the

349
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,340
internet so if it is connected to the

350
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:02,490
Internet it could be attacked we can

351
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:04,170
also try when it is connected to the

352
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,930
internet try some social engineering

353
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:09,720
attacks against the crew members against

354
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,760
the captain or against the own

355
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,050
authorship if we know who the owner is

356
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:19,770
we can also try to weaponize the mobile

357
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:25,350
devices that I am using and we can also

358
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:28,370
try if we get access over one of those

359
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:31,860
devices here to search for those

360
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,750
gateways to have access to the

361
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:38,490
underlying network and of course when we

362
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:42,150
have that achievement solved then we

363
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,770
have access to the complete network here

364
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:48,600
below so in overview is he we have an

365
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,200
attack vector for GPS we have a is that

366
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,600
we can attack we see attacks against

367
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,000
auto pilots the IT equipment on board

368
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,540
and the internet connection and

369
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:02,010
cloud-based services that are coming

370
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:07,230
more and more so let's take a deeper

371
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:10,860
look on those attacks what we can see so

372
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,650
GNSS this global network satellite

373
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:16,950
services or in a shorter way just GPS

374
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:17,810
called

375
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:21,750
so in the GPS we can have spoofing

376
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,940
attacks or we can have a denial of

377
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:30,360
solving attacks jamming so therefore you

378
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,040
have to know that there are five

379
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,450
differences there are four different

380
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:37,320
systems are so they all call GPS systems

381
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:41,460
but we have the u.s. the US version it's

382
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,830
enough star GPS that most of the mobile

383
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:47,100
phones using we have an GLONASS version

384
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,720
it's from the Russians

385
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,590
we have Galileo that the Europeans using

386
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,840
and we have the Baidu version from the

387
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,080
Chinese ones all those working on

388
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,090
different frequencies and here is a

389
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:03,990
frequency map about which kind of

390
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,360
I mean they're using so mostly they're

391
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,300
using the l1 band but some of them also

392
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:15,270
in the l2 and l5 band so but all those

393
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:18,530
systems are using only a few frequencies

394
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:22,170
so it's easy to jam those things so to

395
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:26,370
make it analysis about the GPS so you

396
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:28,050
can easily look at Wikipedia that you

397
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:30,510
have the exact frequency making GEMA for

398
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,880
that and you didn't hear anything about

399
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,550
or they didn't receive an correct

400
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:40,140
positioning about that by the way the l1

401
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:44,660
bandits around 1500 megahertz

402
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:49,260
1542 up to 1500 44 megahertz so it's

403
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:54,510
only 2 megahertz between it yeah so the

404
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:56,970
truth is scenarios that we have here is

405
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:59,850
a we can have jamming or we can have

406
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:02,490
spoofing Jemmy is quite simple you can

407
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:04,560
use an HEC RF was in big container and

408
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:08,190
then you have your goal achieved for the

409
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:10,200
spoofing attacks you need a little bit

410
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,980
more you can buy those stuff also on the

411
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,830
internet for testing devices so when

412
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:20,330
someone has to develop GPS applications

413
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:23,730
so how they test it so you can buy boxes

414
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:27,150
for that how you can where you can

415
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:29,160
change or test

416
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:33,420
GPS equipment and it's available for a

417
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:36,900
1,000 euros something like that but for

418
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,450
really spoofing it's quite harder

419
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:43,170
because you have to manipulate or the

420
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:45,780
receiver with three different booth 2

421
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:50,510
signals because on valid valid GPS

422
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:52,890
positioning is calculated from three

423
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,430
different satellite signals and then

424
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:57,630
from the difference and the signal

425
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:00,090
timing then in the receivers then

426
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:03,360
calculating how how the positioning is

427
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,300
so you have to spoof scree signals and

428
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,360
you have to know which three signals are

429
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,790
inside of the receiver at that point at

430
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:15,120
that time it's possible but it's

431
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,780
a little bit more work so it could be

432
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,330
maybe easier to fake the enemy a data on

433
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:25,550
off the GPS sensors as we keep in mind

434
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:28,920
the GPS receiver is receiving a valid

435
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,920
GPS signal and sending it back over the

436
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,280
enemy a network to all other devices so

437
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,900
when we can have control over this

438
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:40,770
gateway and fake annemiek data on the

439
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:43,110
bus then it doesn't matter what the GPS

440
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,970
sensor is receiving so we can just

441
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:51,000
inject our own GPS signals ok GPS

442
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,720
jamming it happens quite often so mostly

443
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,960
in bigger maneuvers we can see that so

444
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,080
in June last year we had more than 20

445
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,809
reports and at that time some NATO

446
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:10,530
troops where we're maneuvering in the

447
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:13,830
northeast Black Sea and yeah has already

448
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:16,740
said in the Norway report also something

449
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:21,750
like that how we can protect from net so

450
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:24,870
currently there is an research project

451
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:28,950
by the DLR and they trying to make an

452
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:32,790
some kind of yeah detection system to

453
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:38,070
only bypass valid GPS signals and filter

454
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,860
out all those fake signals so how they

455
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,870
doing it so they're having a 2 by 2

456
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:45,750
antenna array here is a signal about the

457
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:48,630
receiving and here you see it it's a

458
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,170
flat panel and here you have a 2 by 2

459
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:54,960
GPS antennas and by calculating the

460
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,970
signals from which angel it coming in

461
00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:00,050
they can filter out ok this must be in

462
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:03,270
wrong one and if it comes from the right

463
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:06,920
angel it must be a right one so they

464
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:10,650
they filter out the wrong ones and

465
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:13,410
amplifying the right ones so it is

466
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:16,080
working but it's still under testing

467
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,500
phase but I'm sure we can see it in the

468
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,539
future yeah

469
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:25,970
now we come a little bit more to a is

470
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:29,960
system so the AES system is interchange

471
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,269
exchanging so many information about the

472
00:26:32,269 --> 00:26:36,289
ships and you also can look up that

473
00:26:36,289 --> 00:26:37,009
easily

474
00:26:37,009 --> 00:26:40,100
maybe someone of you and knowing about

475
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,009
the flight radar

476
00:26:42,009 --> 00:26:44,659
flightradar24 tracker where you can look

477
00:26:44,659 --> 00:26:48,169
up aircraft the same system is available

478
00:26:48,169 --> 00:26:48,769
for ships

479
00:26:48,769 --> 00:26:51,700
it's called Marvin it hang on your penis

480
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:55,639
marina traffic.com yeah you can look up

481
00:26:55,639 --> 00:27:00,620
all the ships I can just I show you Tim

482
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:03,470
to dinner didn't I have it here so this

483
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:09,919
is the web it's not a web site I have to

484
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:17,590
shift it here we go

485
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:25,310
this is here now Tel Aviv the harbor and

486
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,640
here we see some ships that are here so

487
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,520
you can look up on one of those ships

488
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,200
and then see their details about that

489
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:42,340
command okay here it is a sailing boat

490
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:46,450
the name of the ship and so on

491
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:58,670
yeah let's go further with that why my

492
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:01,810
presentation is not coming back

493
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:15,300
here we are okay you can look up all the

494
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,130
informations so you get information

495
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:20,220
about the mobile service identify us

496
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:24,450
so it's like an unique unique number

497
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:27,030
like your mobile phone number then like

498
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,890
two indeed you can have information

499
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:31,290
about it's a ship under Ankara or

500
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:34,410
underway under not under command or

501
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:37,380
something like that the rate of turn the

502
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:40,770
speed the speed over ground positioning

503
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:43,680
occasionally the course over ground the

504
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,650
true heading and some time informations

505
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:49,800
and these are the information that you

506
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,980
can see then on the webpage so here you

507
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:59,220
have P I am oh the mm I the MMS II the

508
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:02,370
original callsign the ship is under the

509
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:04,890
flag of Malta it's a pleasure craft

510
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:10,970
it has 310 gross tonnage it's a 38 meter

511
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:17,850
yacht from 1995 this is the yeah the guy

512
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:19,470
since yacht and this is the actual

513
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:22,170
position about that and it's under the

514
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:24,930
status of word and making no speed so

515
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,200
it's laying anywhere in the harbor and

516
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:33,030
that's it and all those informations are

517
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:37,290
sent every 10 to 10 seconds with all

518
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:43,100
those things that we can see here yeah

519
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:46,590
up to every 6 minutes it's sending a

520
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:49,220
couple of more information about that so

521
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,230
the dimension of the ship the name is a

522
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:56,120
de cargo or whatever ship and so on so

523
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:00,090
this a is system is really quite often

524
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,600
speaking and

525
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,060
spreading the information through the

526
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:07,480
world and how it is working it's just

527
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,620
only a VHF radio channel that are using

528
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:14,320
two channels they're using and you can

529
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,320
listen to that when you have a receiver

530
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:20,050
that's working under 161 and 162

531
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:26,080
megawatts so it's a little bit modulated

532
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:31,300
it's an gsm k gmsk modulated and it's

533
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:35,880
only 9,600 bits today transmitting and

534
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,740
of course there is an HEC RF project for

535
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:42,370
that so our new radio project when you

536
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:44,620
go to the webpage you can download the

537
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:47,020
new radio chart this is under chart how

538
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:51,070
it look like just using some of your RTL

539
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:53,910
SDR devices and then you can listen to

540
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:58,720
the AIS informations if you want to

541
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,860
spoof those informations just change

542
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,420
some of the settings here making

543
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,880
transmitter about it and send whatever

544
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:11,550
you want but remember it's illegal I

545
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:17,980
think okay another one that I mentioned

546
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:21,280
was out of pilots so some ships have

547
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:25,890
autopilot systems onboard so this was a

548
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:29,140
picture that I've made by build up some

549
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:33,250
stuff and sale a friend of me directly

550
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:35,050
recognized a they have an autopilot

551
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:37,540
system onboard I said what yeah they

552
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,370
have a holder pilot so yeah what can you

553
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:41,140
do with that yeah you have a remote

554
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,990
control unit where you can put in the

555
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:46,030
speed and the heading where you want to

556
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:48,250
navigate to so okay you're standing

557
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:50,320
under deck and having like the clicker

558
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,870
here you're saying okay a cross three

559
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:56,110
three two zero with a speed of 10 knots

560
00:31:56,110 --> 00:32:00,250
okay this is how a resample receiver

561
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:04,740
looks like it's a small wireless device

562
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:07,360
okay now I wanted to know how those

563
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,140
wireless devices are working so I didn't

564
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:13,360
know anything about that so I looked up

565
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:13,710
some

566
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:16,710
up for that and then I'm looking for

567
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:19,140
okay where I can start I go to the web

568
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,299
page of Raymarine looking for the

569
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:24,090
autopilot systems and then I found yeah

570
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:27,149
one of those systems then I looked a

571
00:32:27,149 --> 00:32:30,179
little bit deeper so FCC ID because

572
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:32,309
everything what has wireless

573
00:32:32,309 --> 00:32:36,510
transmission anywhere and it's allowed

574
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:42,809
in the market of the US must be yeah

575
00:32:42,809 --> 00:32:45,149
must be on the webpage of the FCC web

576
00:32:45,149 --> 00:32:47,940
site and where you can get informations

577
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:51,090
so I looked up the information for that

578
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:53,909
and then you can see okay

579
00:32:53,909 --> 00:32:56,880
it's those system it operates on two

580
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,279
point four or five gigahertz it's not a

581
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:04,220
Wi-Fi device it's something else so

582
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:07,710
luckily the schematics and detailed

583
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:09,419
information about those systems are also

584
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:12,720
on the webpage so this is also a also

585
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,929
from the FCC ID website where you can

586
00:33:15,929 --> 00:33:19,950
easily see them okay it's an it's an ml

587
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:25,350
a wireless device the the em2 fourth to

588
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:30,120
zero and it's an atmega 64 processor and

589
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,940
it has an own network stack called

590
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:37,950
amber stack so at that point I could not

591
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:40,590
go further because lack of having those

592
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:45,120
devices in place so I'm I think in

593
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,370
September I'm again on a yacht so that I

594
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:50,809
can't go further was those devices to

595
00:33:50,809 --> 00:33:54,659
check again what is transmitted over

596
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:57,570
that how the frequency signals are

597
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:59,460
looking how the modulation schemes are

598
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:04,710
and so on so I think in to the end of

599
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,990
the year I I know more about the

600
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:10,230
autopilot system and I believe there is

601
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:14,099
something possible but I cannot comply

602
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:18,199
now yeah

603
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:20,219
beginning and they're coming back to the

604
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:22,908
beginning of my story

605
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:27,510
I've built up those system because the

606
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:30,480
owner has bought it so it's an device

607
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,480
from local marine it's yeah the left one

608
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,699
it's looking like propery chair and the

609
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:38,130
right one looking like the micro tech

610
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:40,110
metal thing that you can buy on the

611
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:43,199
webpage from Michael mikrotik router and

612
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:47,909
it is one of those models they claiming

613
00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:53,820
to have a booster module and with the

614
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:56,790
right antennas you can have up to 50

615
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:57,840
nautical miles

616
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:04,170
Wi-Fi I'm not sure I've calculated they

617
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:07,530
have 1.6 in what electrical energy under

618
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:13,620
Wi-Fi with the 12 DB antenna I had 25 20

619
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:18,000
why what erp oh I have to hurry up and

620
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,460
[Music]

621
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:25,740
yeah okay we looked up I looked up to do

622
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:29,400
it to the software the software was then

623
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,340
like dresses from the tablet now or from

624
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,860
the computer looks like the same so what

625
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:39,660
I found out then what they make every

626
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,610
time you use the software they make an

627
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:47,790
FTP connect to the router the software

628
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:51,870
then downloading an XML file when you

629
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:56,100
change something in the application it

630
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,750
writes is back in the XML file and

631
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:02,550
uploaded it again to the router and as

632
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:05,940
you know FTP is clear text they're using

633
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:09,390
hard-coded credentials and in the XML

634
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:14,529
files you find all other informations so

635
00:36:14,529 --> 00:36:18,140
the username you see and I love the

636
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:21,230
password because CQ connecting user is a

637
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:24,890
really nice one and also yeah by the way

638
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:28,339
local isn't Spanish word format we're

639
00:36:28,339 --> 00:36:31,490
not crazy crazy yes so I I don't know if

640
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:32,809
it has something to do with the software

641
00:36:32,809 --> 00:36:35,839
but yeah okay then

642
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:37,940
yeah that's paid my attention then I

643
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,980
looked up the software more and more so

644
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:42,740
the Windows executables we're in

645
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:46,670
development net so when you then use the

646
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:49,339
tool like il spire you see some juicy

647
00:36:49,339 --> 00:36:52,279
informations like user names or

648
00:36:52,279 --> 00:36:56,900
developer names and also the yacht

649
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,420
router engine where the configuration

650
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:04,789
everything is in ok the next one is the

651
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:09,710
system has no firewall configured yeah

652
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:13,670
it's a router but on the internet side

653
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:16,910
it should be protected too anyhow yeah

654
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:18,920
from the internet you see all those

655
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,539
ports are open

656
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:23,119
also the FTP one remember there is an

657
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,000
hard-coded credentials what could

658
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,549
possibly go wrong

659
00:37:27,549 --> 00:37:30,380
yeah then they have another function

660
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:33,140
it's called remote support the remote

661
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:37,009
support is yeah you give them a ring say

662
00:37:37,009 --> 00:37:40,250
ok you can support me at that time and

663
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:43,220
then they connect to your device but

664
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,259
they didn't ask for an IP address how

665
00:37:45,259 --> 00:37:48,349
they know they only want to know the

666
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:52,519
serial number of your device yeah every

667
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:54,680
time when you start is a remote support

668
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,869
thing they're making a ping to their

669
00:37:56,869 --> 00:38:01,190
service and the service the IP address

670
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,839
belongs into their systems and then they

671
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:04,490
know ok this is the IP address from that

672
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:09,950
device with that serial number yeah and

673
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:14,869
what they're using then is then the wind

674
00:38:14,869 --> 00:38:17,089
box firemen and the wind box management

675
00:38:17,089 --> 00:38:19,519
software it's an management software

676
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:21,319
that you can use for mikrotik router to

677
00:38:21,319 --> 00:38:23,990
administra everything on the

678
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:28,040
and with these wind box management

679
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:31,160
software you can also look up then other

680
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:35,840
informations like the user loco the

681
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,540
password is not displayed here but the

682
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:42,830
developer has his own back pass user so

683
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:45,200
the developer has always access with his

684
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,870
password and just user name to the boxes

685
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:50,960
when they are online so why should they

686
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,870
have that and you cannot change it on

687
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:56,960
the normal way if you don't know the

688
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,360
password you can also use a tool for

689
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,790
mikrotik router called em Kabuto so you

690
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:04,570
can try to brute force those things yeah

691
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:08,060
so now we have that done so we have to

692
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:12,140
find those yachts I looked up on the

693
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:12,530
webpage

694
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:14,840
they have also some information where

695
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,630
they build up those systems then go to

696
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:21,170
Marina traffic comm there you can look

697
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:25,580
up those devices again and yeah you can

698
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:29,150
see where they are and then you go to

699
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:36,050
show down just look for them when you're

700
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:37,520
done using show done you can see okay

701
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,670
years and ship that I looked up it's on

702
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:44,530
the tender and so on

703
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:47,630
by the way show done has now an ship

704
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:50,810
tracker in own ship tracker service so

705
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:53,870
ship tracker dot showed on dot IO okay

706
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:55,460
you can look up all the systems like

707
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,800
marina traffic comm not so good but you

708
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:02,930
can look up those things yeah okay then

709
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:05,330
I reported it back to the vendor they

710
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:08,270
fixed directly something then in

711
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:11,300
November they finally bring out a final

712
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,410
release

713
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,370
I got a permission to present that stuff

714
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:20,600
I've my CV Eid for that and so on

715
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,180
then I looked up to software what I have

716
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:26,600
patched okay they're using now SSH

717
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:31,040
instead of FTP but obfuscated these

718
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,590
things in the software so I'll spy

719
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:35,160
always

720
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:38,730
jumped out was an error so hmm okay what

721
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:41,700
I can do so I ask it a friend who is

722
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,100
better in reverse engineering so he was

723
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:47,280
able to do something but at the same

724
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,470
time I was looking okay I had the

725
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:52,380
Windows executable but here is also iOS

726
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:54,260
version and there is an Android version

727
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,940
so what I've done then I take the

728
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:02,880
Android app and app decompiled it and

729
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,450
here you can see to use a local as

730
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:08,340
anywhere they have a new password it's

731
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:12,960
no more secure now and and this is the

732
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,110
old one day what they are replacing but

733
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:18,350
they changed not really something else

734
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:22,770
so here is here again and what also was

735
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:25,920
nice there is another one gate a leakage

736
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,790
prevention

737
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:29,790
they own a patch backbone data leak so I

738
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:31,970
don't know where the class is good for

739
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:35,010
yeah maybe you can look up downloading

740
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:40,140
via software as yourself obfuscating is

741
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:43,380
not really protecting if you do obvious

742
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,570
gating don't forget the Android and iOS

743
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:50,640
apks application hard-coded credentials

744
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,710
there's no good solutions for that and

745
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:57,150
yeah SSH is already a good one but don't

746
00:41:57,150 --> 00:42:00,390
forget the other ones and yeah now I

747
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:02,840
have to live hurry up a little bit I

748
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,760
just want to show only the SATCOM things

749
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,200
in a quick way

750
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,310
so internet access vs calm it's also

751
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:14,850
possible these are already known

752
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:17,970
showdown search terms that you can use

753
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:20,580
to look up already known vulnerable

754
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:25,230
versions that are in the Internet yeah

755
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:26,910
the ship Trek has things I also

756
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:30,270
mentioned and the ship tracker one is

757
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:34,980
only using the devii that so in Mossad

758
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:39,750
and so on are also there so I was

759
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:41,850
searching at showdown for some other

760
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:43,780
stuff and then I

761
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:46,810
yeah I dangled over this digital antenna

762
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:49,060
systems so and I looked up what it is

763
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:51,250
and then it comes clear that it was an

764
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:56,980
copan mxp web server for internet access

765
00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:02,320
for those big satellite dishes so this

766
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:05,260
is and clearly index on showdown where

767
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:07,030
you can see okay this is one of those

768
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:08,800
things and when you use the search term

769
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,470
micro digital webserver you find those

770
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:15,970
boxes okay yeah

771
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:19,870
the demo I quit because I have it as a

772
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:22,390
picture also so when you use the

773
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:25,690
showdown search for those terms you find

774
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:30,220
those things this is how the dishes are

775
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:32,950
looking like so they have an web

776
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:35,650
interface and so on the interesting

777
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:37,660
thing is when you have two web page in

778
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:41,590
front there's an a JavaScript loaded in

779
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:45,130
the JavaScript it's in the JSF slash

780
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:49,450
user lock in Java there are some nice

781
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:52,960
stuff if locked on as dealer then use

782
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,530
the menu dealer GX dot HTML if admin use

783
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:59,430
this one if this one use this one okay

784
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:02,680
when you know just putting the URL

785
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:06,400
string in the URL complete then you have

786
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:12,550
access to the system without login so

787
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:14,980
then you are locked in as a dealer and

788
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:18,280
have full access also the nice thing is

789
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,050
you have ten now access to in command

790
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:22,600
line interface with this command line

791
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,150
interface you can do some other nice for

792
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:28,210
like reconfiguring those satellite boxes

793
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:31,690
and you can also do some few more

794
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:34,570
upgrade file uploads downloads and so on

795
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:37,360
so when you want to play with those

796
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,770
stuff feel free

797
00:44:39,770 --> 00:44:43,000
up to you I don't know I I don't do it

798
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,710
by the way if you don't have a password

799
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:53,510
I just read the manual yeah okay then I

800
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:55,670
looked up is there already a CV report

801
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:59,330
for that yeah someone was yeah

802
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:01,880
quicker than I but he reported only one

803
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:05,600
version so I can comply for for other

804
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:10,910
versions that are also vulnerable yeah

805
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:14,060
and by the way these are all other URLs

806
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:18,080
that you can use where you can access

807
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:20,740
the system without authentication so

808
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:23,180
interesting thing is you can configuring

809
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:24,980
i/o ports for other devices the

810
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:27,350
command-line interface change antenna

811
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:29,660
configuration download upload blah blah

812
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:33,490
blah so what is the risk now for that

813
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:36,620
more or less denial of service that's a

814
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:39,260
bad thing or you can increase the cost

815
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:42,770
for the system due to the high expensive

816
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:46,450
data plans that they have and yeah so

817
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:49,130
now we are going to the finish of that a

818
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:53,270
quick future look up so the future is

819
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:56,060
now that I connecting this is only a

820
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:59,540
sample cloud services with cloud devices

821
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:02,690
to all the systems and then access to

822
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:05,570
the complete backbone network so we have

823
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:07,970
to look at those devices in future the

824
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:09,920
cloud services with those things you

825
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,660
have access to the complete engine

826
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:15,970
control systems and so on and yeah

827
00:46:15,970 --> 00:46:18,150
finishing with that made

828
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:21,269
[Music]

829
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:27,980
the last minutes I had to pick up a

830
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:30,310
little bit so if there are any questions

831
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:47,810
yes yeah yeah yeah I expected nothing to

832
00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:51,050
see and yeah as I have seen it down so

833
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:55,760
yeah okay what I was expecting

834
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,670
it was by accident so the computer may

835
00:46:58,670 --> 00:47:01,609
be by accident now and then yeah with

836
00:47:01,609 --> 00:47:03,589
that information then I just have to dig

837
00:47:03,589 --> 00:47:05,869
deeper and append that okay in that loss

838
00:47:05,869 --> 00:47:08,200
available so yeah

839
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:12,950
