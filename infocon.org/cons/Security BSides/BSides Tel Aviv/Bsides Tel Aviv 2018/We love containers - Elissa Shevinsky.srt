1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,569
you ready yeah everyone can hear me yes

2
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:10,590
hey we're all set so thank you for this

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:17,119
warm introduction this is actually -

4
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,949
this is actually a really big deal for

5
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:23,250
me to be here so I'm gonna just tell

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,019
that story really fast I was living here

7
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:28,170
ten years ago in Yerushalayim Grady

8
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,529
housewife so we were running a software

9
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:33,600
firm and I was like you know we were

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,600
hacking and stuff but I really didn't

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,520
leave the house much and I always also

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,879
extremely shy so I would see the things

13
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:44,430
going on and Tel Aviv from my little

14
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,379
house speaking my Shabbat bread you know

15
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,680
in a float and I like wanted to be here

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,840
so badly and I just didn't know how to

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,199
make that happen like at all

18
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,020
I was so shy I wouldn't even tweet and

19
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,289
it was yeah like I made my account and I

20
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:04,229
did nothing with it and I had this dream

21
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:06,119
that someday that would be different for

22
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:09,600
me and ten years later you know it was

23
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,130
like a big journey took me through

24
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,820
Silicon Valley first I overcame the

25
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,390
shyness and started to do more stuff and

26
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,240
eventually got to a place where I can be

27
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,580
here not just like going to meet up and

28
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,380
hanging out but actually sharing some

29
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,400
stuff with you so this is like really

30
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,009
exciting day for me so thank you

31
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,980
of all the things I've done recently

32
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,620
this is really closest to my heart so

33
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,380
thank you besides Aliyev let's get into

34
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,870
it we are here today talking about

35
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,570
containers exploits surprises and

36
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,320
security my name is ELISA chevensky and

37
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,550
for a bet I thought I would be a

38
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,979
developer advocate and this talk was

39
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:01,470
like prepackaged for all of that you

40
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,470
know and it was a lot more corporate and

41
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,550
a lot of the people who talk about

42
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,500
kubernetes talk about containers are

43
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,149
beholden to the companies that they work

44
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:11,250
with I'm a hauled in to Soho token labs

45
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,370
my 22 year old co-founder who is like a

46
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,530
really badass hacker and it's not going

47
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,350
to be mad if I say some things about

48
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,840
kubernetes or about docker so I'm really

49
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,370
excited about this talk because there

50
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,920
aren't that many people on the circuit

51
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,870
talking about kubernetes and docker who

52
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,000
can really like say these things that we

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,489
need to say so I'm really stoked about

54
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:32,820
that

55
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:38,489
I think that's special oh I'm sorry the

56
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:40,200
UI on this is a little different than I

57
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,340
expected I'm not seeing what you're

58
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,310
seeing on my screen software is eating

59
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:48,030
the world Marc Andresen famously said

60
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:54,930
that in 2011 okay fair that was true but

61
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,380
containers are now eating software

62
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:02,480
that's me saying that in 2018

63
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:05,510
yeah it's cool how fast things change

64
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:08,420
and containers are really cool so I'm

65
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,599
gonna talk a little bit about them I'm

66
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,230
gonna talk a little about them but

67
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:17,569
containers are they're very cool but the

68
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:19,909
problem is insecure defaults are also

69
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:23,150
eating your containers they're eating

70
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:27,549
your AWS instances and that's a problem

71
00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:30,079
so let's talk a bit about containers

72
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,549
just to start let's talk about the

73
00:03:31,549 --> 00:03:34,549
promises that they make to us start with

74
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:38,900
docker what is docker does anyone in the

75
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,160
audience want to tell me what is docker

76
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:52,370
truth that's fair anyone else it's a sea

77
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,159
group okay well they claim that they're

78
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:56,989
the world's leading containerization

79
00:03:56,989 --> 00:03:59,930
platform I'd argue that may or may not

80
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,750
be true anymore but it's okay that they

81
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:07,340
see that their promise is also security

82
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,370
they also say that they say that you can

83
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:13,220
deliver applications safer across the

84
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,930
entire lifecycle with built-in security

85
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,750
capabilities and configurations out of

86
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,298
the box just launch docker and you're

87
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:24,800
done that's the promise out of the box

88
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,620
that sounds really good right like just

89
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,150
launched it Security's done I'm a

90
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,620
regular developer I don't have to think

91
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:34,099
about it too much so we're we are gonna

92
00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:37,070
hold them accountable on that cuz it's

93
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:41,599
really not true very recently just a few

94
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,490
days ago in fact I only heard about it

95
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,320
from one of the other speakers last

96
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,930
night a series of malicious crits are

97
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,610
jacking files that were stored on docker

98
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,800
hub have been downloaded more than 5

99
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,889
million times over the last year used to

100
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:58,479
mine over a $90,000 worth of Manero

101
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,789
and that's docker hope that looks really

102
00:05:01,789 --> 00:05:04,310
official right like they're scanning

103
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,750
what's there and they're making sure

104
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,080
that you're not downloading malware

105
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,210
right like I have kind of enterprise-e

106
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,460
expectations about a site that's also

107
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,889
promoting docker con

108
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:18,270
so high level because I'm gonna publish

109
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,710
the slides later like here's the

110
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:23,250
timeline around docker hub and zooming

111
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,830
in the registry was created in 2017 on

112
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:29,130
the first complaint very soon after lots

113
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:31,620
and lots and lots of complaints and very

114
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,130
recently it's basically like a crypto

115
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:40,289
mining botnet so here's a quote from one

116
00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:43,530
of the blogs that did a good job of

117
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:46,020
encapsulating this for ordinary users

118
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,729
just pulling a docker image from docker

119
00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:49,500
hub is like pulling arbitrary binary

120
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,610
data from somewhere executing it hope

121
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:54,979
for the best

122
00:05:54,979 --> 00:06:01,199
so yeah optimism right optimism is a

123
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,289
beautiful thing but maybe less optimism

124
00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:06,270
in our software development and so I

125
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,009
originally thought this talk would

126
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:10,080
really be a lot about docker because

127
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,910
container started with docker and docker

128
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:12,750
so important

129
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,780
Dockers being used so widely but the

130
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:21,510
truth is here we are docker is dead from

131
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,099
my friend Chris who did some excellent

132
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:25,740
talks in the States so yeah we're gonna

133
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,659
stop a docker I've said my piece about

134
00:06:27,659 --> 00:06:30,300
it because docker as a company just

135
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,370
doesn't have the future that we would

136
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,590
hope that it has and if you want to talk

137
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,419
to you about the like economics of

138
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:38,729
making open-source project sustainable

139
00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:41,550
I'm absolutely a hundred percent here to

140
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,500
think and talk about that and I really

141
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,150
respect with Dockers trying to do but

142
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,340
kubernetes came in and ate their lunch

143
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,259
they didn't really have a business model

144
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:51,960
one of the cofounders left and so that's

145
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,000
my explanation to you for why the rest

146
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,370
of the talk is like not about docker

147
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:59,520
despite being about containers so you

148
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,810
know here's to having a business model

149
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,699
please have a business model so you can

150
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:06,449
stay in business docker is dead so we're

151
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:09,330
gonna talk about kubernetes now what

152
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,849
does kubernetes alright from the

153
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:13,229
audience to shout it out what does

154
00:07:13,229 --> 00:07:16,770
kubernetes yeah it's an Orchestrator

155
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,930
that's like the best summation what else

156
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,590
is kubernetes

157
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:25,750
insecure by default yes well then you

158
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,490
just summarize my talk I can get off

159
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:35,440
stage you want to come up anyone else do

160
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,170
I see hands or that shot of whiskey took

161
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:40,470
its toll you're a little blurry

162
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:43,180
all right so according to google

163
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,790
kubernetes is the industry-leading open

164
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,310
source container Orchestrator which

165
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,980
powers kubernetes engine so that's true

166
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,900
that's a true statement and that

167
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:56,470
statement is fine and the promise is

168
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:59,110
that kubernetes can in theory be like

169
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:02,110
really terrific security so this diagram

170
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:04,300
isn't like the best for you to view from

171
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,820
your seats but it basically shows some

172
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,470
of the defense-in-depth that's possible

173
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,300
with containers and with kubernetes and

174
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,790
when configured properly it's a really

175
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:15,400
powerful tool so I think kubernetes is

176
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,310
really cool for big companies that can

177
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:20,110
do the configurations and can support it

178
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:25,030
and one of those companies is Google the

179
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,310
Google cloud website is really

180
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,380
informative containers at Google a

181
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,540
better way to develop and deploy

182
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,330
applications Google has gone so far as

183
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:36,580
to say that it is the Google way from

184
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,440
Gmail to YouTube to search everything at

185
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,049
Google runs in containers and they

186
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:43,210
operate an unprecedented two billion

187
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:47,130
containers a week so like that's a lot

188
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,750
so that's the like containers are eating

189
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,490
software right like it's really taking

190
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:54,130
over it's very interesting and we need

191
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,600
more security people diving into

192
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,340
containers designing cryptocurrency now

193
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,050
so like someone come up and do this

194
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:03,040
instead of me next year here's the

195
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,660
problem with kubernetes the sea is

196
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:11,800
benchmarks is a very long list it's just

197
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,770
so much to do the configuration it is

198
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:18,700
not secure out of the box and by the way

199
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:22,660
these CIS benchmarks they're very

200
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,520
thorough and they did a good job and

201
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,590
like thank you CIS benchmarks but this

202
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:30,070
is not prioritized and so it's just you

203
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,680
know your list of 300 things that you

204
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,310
have to do it's a lot it's a lot for

205
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:36,610
like a

206
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:39,510
two-person team my team's two people I

207
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:44,649
don't think we're gonna do this and I

208
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:46,450
really want to show up here today and

209
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,010
talk to you about fancy exploits cuz

210
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:50,769
you're kind of fancy hackers and I'm a

211
00:09:50,769 --> 00:09:58,750
fancy girl it's true so I advise to get

212
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,550
fancy and talk about like Spector and

213
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,950
meltdown which by the way like came

214
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:06,459
about through like Matt blazes research

215
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:08,769
facility that's funded by like the DoD

216
00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:10,870
and like this just ended up as like a

217
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:13,899
weird outgrowth of that funding just

218
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:16,600
like hooray for like weird academic

219
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:23,980
research yeah right so I really want to

220
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,420
talk to you about fancy exploits for her

221
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,519
I'm just gonna talk about the oldies but

222
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,440
goodies good Ole Miss configuration

223
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,510
because that's what's actually going on

224
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:36,790
here this is my favorite slide because

225
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,680
it's a container that's on fire

226
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,769
it's a trash fire it's a container trash

227
00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:45,579
fire because kubernetes has so many

228
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:48,519
attack vectors and they just don't have

229
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:51,550
to be that way this is a choice this is

230
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,890
a design choice made by the people at

231
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:56,079
kubernetes who are people at Google who

232
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,910
have decided this is how they want to do

233
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:01,240
the software so you know you love trash

234
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,120
you get a trash fire I love trash

235
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,310
you love insecure by defaults you love

236
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:09,490
trash it's trash right it's trash heaven

237
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:13,019
secure default default should be secure

238
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:16,209
but it's not just me right like say

239
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:17,860
something or like do you agree let me

240
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,320
know if you agree yeah it should be

241
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:26,290
secure by default so I used to go into

242
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:28,180
this a lot harder and kind of take on

243
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,250
the individual person at Google who's

244
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,019
been like contributing to this I think

245
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:34,149
more than other people publicly but I

246
00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:35,589
was approached by Red Hat and they're

247
00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:37,000
like you need to do a sit down and like

248
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,529
not be so me and I'm like okay because

249
00:11:41,529 --> 00:11:43,839
you know I think what happened is

250
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,819
kubernetes they didn't think that it

251
00:11:45,819 --> 00:11:47,490
would be used in production that

252
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:49,840
explains a lot doesn't it

253
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,850
cuz you know there does it Google there

254
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,500
like so many projects at Google and

255
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,000
they're all moonshots if they're not

256
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,029
like making money from ads and so people

257
00:11:58,029 --> 00:12:00,070
just do stuff and they don't think that

258
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:03,190
it's going to like eat the world and so

259
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,050
kubernetes is catching up now on

260
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,000
security like so many things it's this

261
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,529
thing after the fact so my hope is that

262
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:13,720
me like really taking them on at some

263
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,140
other events a bit too much has

264
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,089
communicated that the security community

265
00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:22,000
is watching me care about those and in

266
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,640
the meantime we can have some fun with

267
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,210
it

268
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:27,339
I'm a little new to containers

269
00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:31,060
admittedly and so this isn't my original

270
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,980
research this is like really cool stuff

271
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,660
that I found and I really want to share

272
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:37,120
with you and then you go and what do you

273
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,230
do with it is not my business

274
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:44,350
you're responsible adults I trust you

275
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:48,370
you look like trustworthy so we're used

276
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:51,730
to taking very strong measures just that

277
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:58,060
two more minutes oh wow I misinterpreted

278
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,460
the timing by a lot let's go really fast

279
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,370
two more minutes all right

280
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:05,140
so here are people fighting over the

281
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,990
clusters here's the Tesla hack we're

282
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,790
gonna do this in super fast motion and

283
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,980
then I'm gonna put it on the website it

284
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,620
says 1218 here I thought it was still

285
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:18,430
12:30 my apologies there so the hackers

286
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,170
are doing a very good job of hiding

287
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:22,900
themselves and here's what I really want

288
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:27,070
to show you I'm glad that you appreciate

289
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:29,500
this so here's a bunch of things that

290
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,870
are insecure by default someone

291
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,670
commenting on github is there a CV for

292
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:37,750
this and the folks from Google are

293
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,790
saying it's a Mis configuration not a CV

294
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:43,860
II thanks it's fine

295
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,380
and here's showdown so this is what I

296
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,910
think you're gonna love you can just

297
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:51,700
type in kubernetes master and you can

298
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,400
just find all the vulnerable kubernetes

299
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:59,500
instances and you know here's some

300
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,240
common vulnerabilities that you can look

301
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,759
for on showed in

302
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,139
there are a lot of security problems and

303
00:14:05,139 --> 00:14:07,029
they're just known this is the problem

304
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:10,060
that they're known you look at etcd and

305
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:15,129
they say this feature is off by default

306
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:18,790
to preserve backwards compatibility so

307
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,379
you know the authentication was a

308
00:14:20,379 --> 00:14:22,930
completely open system anyone with

309
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:25,720
access the API could change the keys you

310
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,670
know we're gonna leave this insecure for

311
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:31,290
backwards compatibility no big deal so

312
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:36,370
you know here's some information on the

313
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:40,110
port it leaks all kinds of passwords and

314
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:43,800
here are the vulnerabilities to look for

315
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,120
and here's what you type in to showdown

316
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:52,170
let's keep going it smells that I like

317
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,730
Claire OS is good anything made by

318
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,740
kubernetes is actually pretty good cout

319
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,870
bench is good here's what you get for

320
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:01,749
output hep-c oh very good and they're

321
00:15:01,749 --> 00:15:03,759
hiring and they're remote that's good

322
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:07,720
money in Israel yeah you want jobs in

323
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,589
America you come to me and let's wrap

324
00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:14,620
this up there's so much here I love this

325
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,740
slide

326
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,920
a round of applause for me because we

327
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,390
you know I'm not shy anymore

328
00:15:27,589 --> 00:15:30,450
