ambassador from DEFCON the biggest

13
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,399
hacker convention on earth in Las Vegas

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,700
he just returned from a trip to China

15
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,680
where they did a very special Def Con

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,010
China event because the founders of Def

17
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,320
Con decided that yeah that's pretty

18
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,980

so DEFCON China and Jason will tell us a

21
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:53,070
little about that that was actually

22
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,530
because they decided that if the

23
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,480
security researchers in China cannot

24
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,670

doing

40
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,890
it's like I have to apologize I've been

41
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:44,020
trying to dress Nasir but my luggage

42
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,520
I've been the shirt is somewhere in

43
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,399
Israel so that's good I don't know where

44
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,039
in Israel it is but it's supposed to be

45
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:53,560
here so thank you Turkish Airlines for

46
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,100
that I fly United at least he didn't

47
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,210
beat me up so I got that going for me so

48
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:04,630
yeah so a pardon for my my dress but I

49
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:07,750
want to get right into it I was asked by

50
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,699
Carina she asked me to do the keynote

51
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:12,430
and I was like and she said like 15

52
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:15,280
minutes you got 15 minutes and everybody

53
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,019
knows how much I talk it's like that's

54
00:02:17,019 --> 00:02:18,519
really something you know coming up with

55
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:21,099
15 minutes of trying to because usually

56
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,470
it's like an hour and 15 minutes I can

57
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,180
manage maybe it's like you just an hour

58
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:29,110
32 hours so I wanted to get inside what

59
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:31,060
am I going to talk to you about what do

60
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,280
I think is so important that I want if I

61
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,110
only have 15 minutes I want to talk to

62
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,150
you about and so I came up with this

63
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:41,500
talk it's called greater than 300 even

64
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,190
more powerful than over 9,000 a little

65
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:48,489
bit about me is you may have seen me rob

66
00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:50,650
a bank on National Geographic talked on

67
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,389
the news but more likely you've seen me

68
00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:54,269
on your surveillance cameras robbing you

69
00:02:54,269 --> 00:02:57,370
that's sort of what I do so I do a

70
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:59,079
little bit of offensive and defensive

71
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:01,209
kind of thing but let's get straight

72
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:03,639
into the 300 because most people are

73
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:05,889
thinking this 300 it's like you're

74
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:07,389
thinking you know that's what I want to

75
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:08,769
talk about you know which is you know a

76
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:10,389
cool movie and stuff you know it's nice

77
00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:15,430
it's like but no it's this you have over

78
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:18,310
300 days to the next besides Tel Aviv

79
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:21,850
what are you gonna do with it what's up

80
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:24,370
it's like has anybody here you've been

81
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,920

82
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,760
hand you've been here for the whole

83
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,599
conference have you learned something

84
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:32,889
something in something inspired you

85
00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:34,930
something thought about it it's like one

86
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,280
of the questions I gotta ask you is like

87
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,380
what are you going to talk about next

88
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:42,329
year what's your subject going to be

89
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:44,709
it's like you see people up here with

90
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:45,580
talks and say

91
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,950
see me with my talks and I hope when you

92
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,140
look at my talks you say wow that's

93
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,350
pretty basic Jason okay because it

94
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,480
usually is pretty basic it's like and

95
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,690
that's fine because I'm not trying to go

96
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,130
and say all the advanced stuff it's like

97
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,690
I want you to start off with the basics

98
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:03,970
I want you to understand that there are

99
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,830
still people out there that need to know

100
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:09,040
how to get started they need to know

101
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,100
what the basics are I mean advanced you

102
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,570
know using a zero-day to pop a

103
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:16,480
calculator on an ATM or a toaster oven

104
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,180
or a light bulb yay it's like that's

105
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,780
awesome but we need to keep education

106
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,880
going and it's like and it's not just

107
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,280
going to be me keep being up on stage

108
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,790
giving talk after talk you need to be on

109
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:33,070
stage you need to be sharing the

110
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:36,450
information it is just selfishly

111
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:39,250
horrible that you have knowledge that I

112
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,380
don't know and you're keeping it to

113
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,440
yourself it's like I don't

114
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,270
the uten the most useless time that I

115
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,680
have at a conference is this right here

116
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,060
because I'm not learning all I'm doing

117
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,770
is going below and it's like I'm just

118
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:54,730
talking and you know

119
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:57,130
babbling you're on and I'm not getting

120
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,230
anything out of it and I am selfish it's

121
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,300
all about me right it's like I want to

122
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,800
learn I come here to learn

123
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,050
I come here to network I come here to

124
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,960
find out what you have to say what you

125
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,140
know it's like I need you to share more

126
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,810
of your information I need you to come

127
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,330

00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,020

it's like from car hacking to voting

170
00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:44,569
machine hacking there's something there

171
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:46,680
it's like and it doesn't just have to be

172
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,419
that conference you can start developing

173
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:50,729
those talks and start understanding that

174
00:06:50,729 --> 00:06:52,530
that's what this community is about this

175
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:55,889
community is not built on just listening

176
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:58,530
to what other people have to say it's

177
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:01,139
about sharing information it's about

178
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:03,509
being part of the community and one of

179
00:07:03,509 --> 00:07:05,159
the key things is is that you're part of

180
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:06,599
the community all over the world Oh

181
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:08,580
waitron world Sorry Sorry

182
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,080
that was for another slide deck it's

183
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,349
like flat earth you know sorry no this

184
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:16,889
is the world right there we go so you're

185
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:18,300
part of the world you're part of a

186
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,819
global community it's like and what does

187
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:23,130
that mean what does that mean to be part

188
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,500
of the global community

189
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,750
it means participating and understanding

190
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,340
that the global is not just in our

191
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,039
backyard not just what we agree on not

192
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:34,169
what we're a part of but just accepting

193
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:36,509
all different sides of it it's like so

194
00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:37,800
it's like one of the key things it's

195
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,819
like and that's one things I like about

196
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:40,979
DEFCON groups is that we share that it's

197
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:42,930
like we share that spirit of

198
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,060
communication and being part of a

199
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,560
community something bigger than

200
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,870
ourselves one of the best things that I

201
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:52,520
like back in the 90s is being on the IRC

202
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,159
it's like IRC was like slack but you

203
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,889
know almost it's worse so it's like in

204
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:00,000
case you're wondering what a higher C

205
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,969
was okay and the best thing about being

206
00:08:02,969 --> 00:08:05,610
on IRC is that I didn't know where you

207
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,300
came from

208
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,949
I mean people older than me one for the

209
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:09,340
BBS I did some VBS

210
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,620
I was like nine but not very many but

211
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,710
it's like MBBS Azhar were actually worse

212
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:17,590
than slack so you have to go through

213
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,150
that and you look at that and you know

214
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,210
what I didn't know where you came from I

215
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:23,860
didn't know where you lived I didn't

216
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,080
know what your religion was I didn't

217
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,610
know what you look like I didn't know

218
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,710
what color you were what gender you were

219
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,729
nothing I knew what you thought I knew

220
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:35,320
what information that you had to share

221
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,960
with me and what information you wanted

222
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,870
to me to share with you that's what I

223
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:44,130
knew then we got Instagram

224
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:49,570
crap now I know you're a girl now I know

225
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,750
you're a guy now I know that you're

226
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,850
different color than me now I know you

227
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:56,740
have a different religion than I am and

228
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,070
that's when it started going south it's

229
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,380
because we started letting that dictate

230
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,710
instead of what the information dictated

231
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,330
we are part of a global community we're

232
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:09,910
not when I came here I was having people

233
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,500
tell me saying oh Jase are you sure

234
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,810
about coming here it's like yeah like

235
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:17,920
why not I've been to over 45 countries

236
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,370
in ten years and I am telling you right

237
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:24,580
now I have never met a foreigner you sit

238
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:27,190
down in the corner of Beijing it's like

239
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:29,560
and you see people going to school it's

240
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,839
like taking their kids to school

241
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:34,029
businessmen going off to work it's like

242
00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:35,560
that's the same thing I see here in

243
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,900
Jerusalem when I was there just this

244
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,000
morning it's like it's the same thing I

245
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,529
see in the Philippines it was the same

246
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:44,260
thing I saw in Bogota Colombia same

247
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:48,209
thing I see in Paris France were people

248
00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:51,250
what separates us is perceptions and

249
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,190
fears and you can't let other people's

250
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,740
projections of fear of what they think

251
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,830
this the world is shadow or shame change

252
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:02,110
what you want so we had some things

253
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,950
thank you

254
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:10,580
and there was some talk about DEFCON

255
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,410
Beijing and I was told to mention about

256
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:13,640
that and that's one of the key things

257
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,400
it's like I heard about was like oh my

258
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:16,970
gosh

259
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:21,500
taking it over to Beijing okay it's like

260
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,390
you know they'll do this you'll know

261
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,890
they'll do this you'll know they're

262
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,620
gonna do this and I'm like I've been

263
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:30,140
going my first conference outside of the

264
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:33,140
US my first time outside of the US was

265
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,560
to Beijing in 2008 and I'm telling you

266
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,040
right now I was afraid I I mean I used

267
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,030
to be look I use them to behind a

268
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:43,490
dumpster okay it's like when I was 16

269
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:45,680
it's like trust me I know what being

270
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,330
afraid was like it hasn't been happening

271
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,430
in like decades okay because it's like

272
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:50,930
I've got a very high threshold of fear

273
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:55,310
and but my first time I was afraid and

274
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:58,130
you know what that was until I got out

275
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:01,370
of my hotel room it's like that was when

276
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,780
I started walking around and meeting

277
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,640
people and seeing people and when I went

278
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,340
to the first conference I wasn't an

279
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:10,330
American that was coming over there to

280
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:13,790
you know spy or be part of whatever the

281
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:16,370
hacking community and trying to I was a

282
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:19,430
hacker I was someone wanting to learn I

283
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:23,300
was well received I was welcomed to the

284
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,600
after party it was amazing time that's

285
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,390
what Def Con was trying to bring to

286
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,550
China it's like Def Con wasn't trying to

287
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:34,790
bring Def Con Vegas to China Def Con was

288
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,160
trying to bring a conference a place

289
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,930
where people in the same kind of style

290
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:41,480
that the Chinese already have to share

291
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,760
information because one of the biggest

292
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,830
problems we have in this community and

293
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,740
on this I think planet is that everybody

294
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,020
is too busy talking about each other and

295
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,720
not to each other and that's what we

296
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,820
need to start building bridges on we

297
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,890
need to start opening communication we

298
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,870
need to start understanding that what I

299
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:02,690
have to say is important who here thinks

300
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,720
that they have a talk or idea or

301
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,130
something their passion about that

302
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,590
they're able to give out and share by

303
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:12,130
next year

304
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:19,280
what is this do you realize that my

305
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:25,100
talks to me are crap seriously I have

306
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:28,400
one of the best examples of you know

307
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,620
impostor syndrome on the world the only

308
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,320
thing I'm good at is failing it's like

309
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,880
the only thing that I've really been I

310
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,920
mean I actually had a talk based on all

311
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,260
my fails it's like not really cool fails

312
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,610
where I accidentally robbed the wrong

313
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,230
bank or anything like that it was

314
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:45,530
literally how I screwed up and how I

315
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,420
messed up and don't do the things that I

316
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:50,900
did but I still get up here because I

317
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,030
hope at least one point someone will

318
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,740
hear something and they'll either go and

319
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,570
say wow I learned something from that

320
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:58,310
guy it's like I want to learn and do

321
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:01,460
more to it or crap I can't be worse than

322
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,350
that guy it's like I want to go up and

323
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:06,800
talk next time either way so don't let

324
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,320
your voices it's like here you know that

325
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,700
voice in the back of your head that says

326
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,740
that you're not good enough or you don't

327
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:15,470
think have someone has to learn stopped

328
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:18,170
you from teaching from sharing your

329
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,910
information the hacker community is

330
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:23,510
about sharing information so if you're

331
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,550
part of this community then you should

332
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:28,520
be sharing information it's like and if

333
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,780
you're not in this music will Jason I'm

334
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,160
not in this hacker community well you

335
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,190
should be it's an amazing place because

336
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,140
you're accepted for who you are and what

337
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:40,610
you know not what religion not what

338
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:43,270
color not what gender not who you love

339
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:46,570
it's what you know and what you can show

340
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,640
that's what this has got to be about

341
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,600
this was supposed to be a very quick

342
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,500
talk I think I accomplished that what I

343
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,350
will do is like open it up for questions

344
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:59,750
it's like you can ask me about anything

345
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,250
then one of the key things I have to

346
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:04,790
warn you about I do not filter at all so

347
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,860
you can ask me any question that you

348
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,270
feel like you think you can get away

349
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:10,460
with and be careful because I will

350
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,470
answer it as honestly and unfiltered as

351
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:15,800
I can it's been very embarrassing in

352
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,120
several different locations around the

353
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,510
world but I will do that here so let's

354
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:24,939
start with some questions yes

355
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,110
that is a good question I don't have one

356
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,970
I have five home away from home cities I

357
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:36,430
have five cities that I know everywhere

358
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,200
to go I know where everything's at I

359
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,300
know where all the Pizza Hut's are it's

360
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,360
like I I have had cab drivers tear ID

361
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,560
take me to the long way and I've been

362
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,720
able to stop them going no no I'm not a

363
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,700
tourist you go this way

364
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,760
it's Beijing Berlin Singapore Shanghai

365
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,210
in Paris it's like they're they're not

366
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,290
like the best ones but they're the ones

367
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,930
that I've gone to the most mall say

368
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:01,300
Michelle took my breath away

369
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,240
it's like when I was 10 years old

370
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,940
it's an awful the coast of France when I

371
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,490
was 10 years old I didn't have let's

372
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,380
just say a normal childhood it was

373
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:14,350
against the Geneva Conventions but I

374
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,600
used to read national Geographics and I

375
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,460
would see the different cities inter and

376
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,410
mossy Michelle was the first place that

377
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:23,620
I ever saw that was like beautiful and

378
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,500
real was like oh my gosh I don't have to

379
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,820
live here I could actually live

380
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,160
somewhere like that and two years ago I

381
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,650
actually got to go to it and so and one

382
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:34,060
of the best pictures it's like I'm one

383
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,080
of my wallpapers I'm one of my

384
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,470
computer's is a picture not looking at

385
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,089
Mont saint-michel because that's all I

386
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:41,650
did my whole entire life it was a

387
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,330
picture of outside my hotel window

388
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:45,490
seeing the outside of it so I was

389
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:46,780
actually looking out from Mont

390
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,970
saint-michel so that was probably one of

391
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,890
the best places I've ever been just

392
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:53,380
because of that memory but I've seen

393
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,780
beauty here it's like I was walking on

394
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,990
Mount Zion and I got lost I was trying

395
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:02,110
to get to the tomb of King David and I

396
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:04,210
just randomly walked up to a lady and

397
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:05,740
she was like and I was like she was

398
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,210
waiting for the bus she's busy she was

399
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:09,010
looking on her phone alright and I had a

400
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,050
map say hey can you can you show me it's

401
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:12,940
like I'm trying to get to is this worth

402
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,710
that and not only does she give me

403
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,390
directions but this she was like and

404
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:19,930
enjoy your stay here it's kindness

405
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:22,870
everywhere it is not something beholden

406
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:25,360
to one area or one city I've seen it in

407
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,400
every city I've been in I've seen it in

408
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:32,850
every country that I visited yes

409
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:41,210
yes my favorite failure

410
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,490
[Music]

411
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:46,610
my favorite failure was attacking the

412
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:50,780
network guys I went and created a whole

413
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,150
I created such an adversarial

414
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,860
relationship with the networking and IT

415
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,080
team because security and network guys

416
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,520
were not supposed to get along they know

417
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,010
what they did so it's like so so I had

418
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:04,099
this I had this adversarial relationship

419
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:06,470
with them and I noticed one time on the

420
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:09,619
firewall these weird telnet sessions

421
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:10,790
that were being dropped but it was

422
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,230
coming from inside the network you know

423
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,609
the phone calls coming from inside the

424
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:13,970
house

425
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:16,310
I freaked them out right it's like I

426
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:18,290
lost you know flare guns it's like we

427
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:20,000
had like the big red button was pushed

428
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,280
talked to the CIO got him over there

429
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,150
where we're trying to figure out what's

430
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:25,180
going on I'm freaking out

431
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:28,520
about 15 minutes later the junior

432
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,160
network guys like oh could that be my

433
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,740
scan that I'm doing for with our Orion

434
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,210
system and or whatever and said you know

435
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:38,990
to our external our routers it's like

436
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:43,820
our branch routers yes it could be you

437
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,040
know it's like and the thing was he

438
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,920
could have probably told me that sooner

439
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,910
but I was an a-hole

440
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:53,930
why bother I've learned that your

441
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:55,790
facilitator in information security

442
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:58,790
you're not the law you're not I am the

443
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:01,670
authority I know you are the facilitator

444
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:04,100
you're there to help networking is just

445
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,260
like anybody else and when they start

446
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,840
realizing that you're helping them they

447
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,850
start helping you so that was probably

448
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:13,130
one of my best failures is that because

449
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:15,170
I started at that point to be better at

450
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:20,950
communicating with the network right yes

451
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:53,840
and that's perfect and do you realize

452
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,670
there's people all over that would love

453
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,140
to hear about that people that want to

454
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,330
talk to their children other people that

455
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:01,580
are watching youtube videos do you know

456
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,440
how I have two kids do you know how much

457
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,720
time they spend on YouTube they would

458
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,910
love to stumble across a video of

459
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:09,380
someone like you coming up here and

460
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,700
showing them how to get it done

461
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,190
I got a deem today if someone's like how

462
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,900
do I become a hacker okay

463
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,450
I haven't replied yet but first of all

464
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:19,400
that's not a good question okay because

465
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,110
you're a hacker you don't ask how to be

466
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:23,540
a hack you can't be a hacker you can't

467
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:26,480
learn to be a hacker it's just built

468
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,000
into who we are it's like every child

469
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,960
was a hacker

470
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,400
it's like someone what times we lose

471
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,630
that you know how you know a child's a

472
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:36,710
hacker why why does this work

473
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:40,340
why okay how's it why and they just ask

474
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,320
that why they have that curiosity that's

475
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,170
always built in so it's like yes to show

476
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:46,400
people it's like how to do the

477
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,260
streamline how to make the shortcuts

478
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,140
that's valuable so everybody has

479
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,460
something contribute it doesn't always

480
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:55,160
have to be a zero day none of my talks

481
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,930
involves zero day none of my talks

482
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:59,510
evolve one or two or three days most of

483
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:01,340
them are like four hundred or above days

484
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:04,970
okay it's like nothing new okay but I

485
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,290
still get up and I still share that

486
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,490
information because I think it might

487
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:10,150
help someone

488
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:14,300
yes the local DEFCON groups invited you

489
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:18,920
to come in and talk as well hey so any

490
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,670
other questions by the way if we still

491
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:24,830
have time this is the way I work if I

492
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,900
still have time which I do and no one

493
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,270
answers a question to ask a question I

494
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,430
randomly pick someone in the audience to

495
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:35,810
ask me a question okay there we go okay

496
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:37,790
so who wants to ask me a question or

497
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:55,420
should I go find out someone yes yes

498
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:59,020
actually was a pretty good one I was

499
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,250
robbing a bank in Houston Texas

500
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:05,030
it's like and I just found blueprints

501
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,550
for the bank in the construction

502
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:10,520
dumpster and if you don't know how

503
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,730
valuable blueprints are for a bank they

504
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,050
should not be left in the construction

505
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:16,670
dumpster thank goodness it wasn't the

506
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:17,960
regular dumpster I end up in a lot of

507
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,280
dumpsters okay I like construction

508
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,510
dumpsters to the best because there's

509
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:24,020
less food matter or other matter and so

510
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,570
I'm coming out and I'm bout to like go

511
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:28,520
out and do my happy dance everybody has

512
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,720
their own happy root dance when they

513
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,830
break something you know it's like I'm

514
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,300
not gonna show you my root dance but uh

515
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,070
so I'm about to get out of this dumpster

516
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:36,470
and I see blue and red lights and I'm

517
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:39,230
like I didn't order disco lights for my

518
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,640
happy root dance where did this come

519
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,560
from it's like it's all of a sudden

520
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,700
there's like a police officer he's like

521
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,810
that was your end

522
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:46,250
what was your if it hits and I'm like

523
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,710
I'm coming out of a dumpster but I'm in

524
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:51,530
Texas I could die now okay it's like so

525
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:53,180
it's like I literally get out of my I

526
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:57,800
have a letter to don't shoot me here I

527
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,170
have a letter I'm going for paper and I

528
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:02,120
pull out the get-out-of-jail-free card

529
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,390
and I sashay it sideways to the guy less

530
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,580
likely to kill me and it's like he was

531
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,020
the older dude that was passenger and

532
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:14,150
I'm like here it's like you know as

533
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:17,030
adorably and as harmless as I can and he

534
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:19,370
read it like cursory and you know what

535
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:21,260
he said he's like oh he's

536
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,540
engagement it's like fine whatever and

537
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:29,300
then it hit me what did he do he let me

538
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:29,900
go

539
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,280
and he didn't call any of the numbers I

540
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,550
now carry to get out of jail free cards

541
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:39,080
one is the one that the company gave me

542
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,730
and the other one is the forged one that

543
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:43,550
I make myself telling whoever catches me

544
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:45,290
that they have to do everything that I

545
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:46,820
say they can't put it in the report

546
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,790
because it's an ongoing audit and the

547
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,260
numbers that I give them our burner

548
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,360
phones that are my colleagues have who

549
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,890
will answer the phone as the person

550
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:56,540
that's supposed to be on there it's an

551
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,520
amazing I have that one company who

552
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,290
actually said for a bonus they wanted me

553
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:02,750
to go into their server room and take a

554
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,130
server out of their server room they had

555
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:05,960
one to set up aside so you'll know by

556
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,640
the name of it and stuff it sits on the

557
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,470
side just like you'll get a bonus I'd go

558
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,790
in there and I break into the server

559
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:14,360
room at night and those it okay I can't

560
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,230
say that word those wonderful people

561
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,400
decided to be a little funny and play a

562
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,590
joke on me the server they put for the

563
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:25,040
bonus was an old compact scuzzy file

564
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,110
server that weighs like five for you

565
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:29,060
five thousand pounds I may be

566
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,340
exaggerating a little bit okay

567
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,900
it's like and that was on the side of

568
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:36,050
the corner I was like oh we're gonna be

569
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:41,360
funny today so I go back outside and I

570
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,710
get caught by security and it's like and

571
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:47,270
when the security comes it's like they

572
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:49,010
catch me it's like because I was very

573
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,750
obvious to make sure that they did it's

574
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,010
like I handed them my forge

575
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:54,140
get-out-of-jail-free card that talk to

576
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,130
him about like you have to do everything

577
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:57,070
and I say you have to light and they

578
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:59,630
carried the server out to my car because

579
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:01,160
that sucker was heavy and I wasn't doing

580
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,640
it okay it's like so my best epiphany

581
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,670
was figuring out I can get away with

582
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:12,530
forged emails yes okay yes one last

583
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:13,160
question

584
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,030
yes

585
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:19,969
[Music]

586
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:24,860
very simple what do you like doing what

587
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,080
do you have a passion about what makes

588
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,030
you curious and make it something that

589
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,680
you may not know that very much do you

590
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,920
know the best way to learn something is

591
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,090
knowing that you have to give a talk on

592
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:37,100
it that people are going to question you

593
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,650
want it you learn it real thorough it's

594
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,120
like when you know that's coming down

595
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,580
it's like so find something you have a

596
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,260
passion about something you may not even

597
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,690
know about yet it's like and then start

598
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,820
studying tell yourself I want to give a

599
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,260
talk on this figure out how you're gonna

600
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,270
give a talk on it what parts of that

601
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:55,070
you're gonna because every you can

602
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:57,290
everybody in this room can give a talk

603
00:24:57,290 --> 00:25:00,950
on in MAPP and hardly any of them are

604
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:03,380
going to be the exact same it's like

605
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,580
because everybody has a different

606
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,200
approach to what they're learning

607
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,030
everybody has a different approach to

608
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:09,650
see something and the way that you see

609
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,390
something maybe the aha moment for

610
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:12,920
someone else in this audience that goes

611
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,470
and says I never saw it that way now it

612
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:18,320
makes sense so that's what you do you

613
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,790
find the thing that makes you passionate

614
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:22,090
about and you share it with the world

615
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:23,870
all right thank you

616
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:28,719
[Applause]
