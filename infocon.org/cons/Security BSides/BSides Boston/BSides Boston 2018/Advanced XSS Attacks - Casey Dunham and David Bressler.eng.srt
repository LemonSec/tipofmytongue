1
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:19,020
for you well today's you taught me to

2
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,279
appreciate it thanks for these sides

3
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:26,630
gravity here oh good one here you ok I

4
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:29,040
can't get myself protection this but um

5
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:30,119
so real quickly enjoy the other lot size

6
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,399
to get through this is kind of a

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:35,489
two-part talking pets you don't want so

8
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,670
Ruby moving kind of fast at stop sign me

9
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:41,370
feel free to ask logical trying but this

10
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:45,600
is an orphan children conscripting like

11
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:47,760
that um so today introduction real quick

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,110
out engler dance expressions yes

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,360
cross-site scripting and then we'll go

14
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:53,610
to talk about hibernate and single

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,050
injection through heaven and a little

16
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:59,280
bit of prevention of stuff to you no

17
00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:01,440
plans of tarqah Q&A alright so as is

18
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,239
injurious minus K star now for the

19
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,459
kitchen security consulting before I'm

20
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:08,100
done security work under the sky over

21
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:10,048
here and the new code reviews about

22
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,490
other patient assessments and this

23
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:15,209
promotion majority of time the small

24
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:18,318
let's do it call for training I remember

25
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:20,520
open organization law Pickers kochetkov

26
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:23,249
rebooting the last name and a big

27
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,719
ruthless DC 2 of 7 thing failing at that

28
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:28,100
for a while how many people have done

29
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:30,208
any angularjs worth a few home okay um

30
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:32,490
it's only I'm still learning I feel like

31
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:35,700
many times how many obstacles oh that's

32
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:37,079
silver party won't worry oh boy you know

33
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,939
it's going to do it so engler chance is

34
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:41,579
a front end of JavaScript framework

35
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:43,229
developed at Google this is going to be

36
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:49,380
picked up on google and a lot of the

37
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:51,119
Google Apps of your degree so if you're

38
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,589
the term a single page application is

39
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,259
where this comes from others angularjs

40
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,779
backbone and forecast of all so the

41
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:01,859
frameworks for making really rich you I

42
00:01:57,779 --> 00:02:04,469
heavy client-side applications bolson

43
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:07,919
we're behind us rest api that Norfolk

44
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:10,889
JSON permit data retrieval updating data

45
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:13,859
that my goodness it will step into code

46
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:16,799
and you can see here looks mostly like

47
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,200
HTML is something we have some

48
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,090
additional stuff here that individuals

49
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,720
provides interestedly money energy on

50
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,910
season long

51
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,340
aw d HTML so they have what they call

52
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:28,799
directives or attributes that we can add

53
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:31,350
in resemble you know but aren't actually

54
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,850
HTML and what you'll see all the time

55
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:35,359
this will be important later on is the

56
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:38,900
NGF directive kind of bootstraps our

57
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:41,370
application so when the page first hotel

58
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,900
anchor chances of ability to look for

59
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,810
this ng-app directive customers have

60
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,070
served please copy itself important a

61
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:50,100
good one is an anchor jess will actually

62
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:51,570
build the top of that and this is where

63
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,799
it starts doing that process it starts

64
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:55,140
building looking through the technology

65
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,590
bottle that says that rebuilding the

66
00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:01,200
vehicle directives there's no the little

67
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:02,250
to hear ng repeat very much like if

68
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,940
you've done any time a template

69
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:08,010
programming very significant energy acid

70
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,920
is also object or capable smart so if

71
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:13,679
you have like this featured products Oh

72
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,329
ray or list and behavior it through

73
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,459
product and English just will repeat

74
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:18,810
this here I'm really completely the

75
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:24,030
important part on don't want to kind get

76
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:26,100
back on so this is where because we're

77
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:27,900
going positive these are grown as

78
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,150
expressions and they're just these are

79
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,830
valued at the client site so product

80
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:34,200
that name will be evaluated in April

81
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:36,180
product rather than inside now that's

82
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:40,230
only dawn on the client side papi server

83
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:43,550
side so here's another one day g source

84
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:45,768
has view image URL of very similar so

85
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:48,000
this is an angular portion of this

86
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:50,340
position on that's good just plenty to

87
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,450
help so this is why he's one can sent to

88
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:56,459
the client so one thing about John of

89
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:58,470
first day there just expresses vs of

90
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:02,580
JavaScript expressions is they are kind

91
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:04,830
of it it's pointless it global functions

92
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,880
equities and so the limitations that you

93
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:08,280
would think that a function is no

94
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:10,170
control those statements it doesn't

95
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,870
offer filters like the straightest one

96
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:16,769
here the currency especially a built-in

97
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:19,380
filter puts like currency amounts so we

98
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:23,370
have some limitations here but you're

99
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:24,900
still some issues here and no not about

100
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:27,120
Japanese zero days I'm going to hear

101
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,799
you're really fit aside we learn you

102
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,450
know court's order pair of days has

103
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,660
haunted reputation of the website and

104
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:34,830
he's got essentially sandbox escape

105
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,840
sorry Oh

106
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:38,849
every version of angularjs most recent

107
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,429
wants to talk how many that I go yeah

108
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:44,430
but he goes it isn't a lot more detail

109
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:47,460
and it's really hard to explain the same

110
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:48,900
last escape life on screen at riding it

111
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51,479
doesn't work out too well but he doesn't

112
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:54,630
even kill off all cookies development of

113
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:56,550
that which is pending so here it is here

114
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:59,969
this is a sandbox escape so what we're

115
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:03,780
doing is you have a English its

116
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:06,090
expression put it will go to this like

117
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:09,030
brouhaha this little park on this

118
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:10,890
English s expression essentially is

119
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:14,130
built in a way that breaks angularjs

120
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:17,340
code so we rejecting our payload into

121
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:19,950
English as itself so one of these arts

122
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:21,810
going on here is we got this here what

123
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,950
we're doing this where one thing that's

124
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:24,360
really cool with javascript is you can

125
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:25,950
the prototype functionality have

126
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,270
predefined functions we can overload

127
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:30,120
that we can create the most on the fly

128
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:32,599
so if you were essentially of back

129
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,920
dooring the character I function and

130
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,470
reason we do that is that where this is

131
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:39,660
being used in a dress code of since fear

132
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:41,880
can use it with the rainy joy here

133
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:46,080
anytime that character is all it's

134
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:48,150
actually a great option and then email

135
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,440
this is a built in angular motion and

136
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:51,960
it's essentially reduce if you evaluate

137
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,480
our code and then when that happens for

138
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,010
us apart here is built this is what's

139
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,140
actually being attracted in engler to

140
00:05:56,010 --> 00:06:00,210
fix this effects so that the entire

141
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:02,099
English Jessica doesn't freak then our

142
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:04,349
payload is something you would want to

143
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:07,020
use it this and we can use this anywhere

144
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:09,900
we want for version 1 dot 49 pain to the

145
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:12,090
gas which is old photography of course

146
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:14,099
be civil here so then be this simply

147
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:17,460
swap out or loved one the point of our

148
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:19,380
payload cab fares our exercise however a

149
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:22,739
couple other things did happen um and

150
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:23,670
I'm just going to show the phone for

151
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,050
this because when I started learning

152
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:29,070
this is start playing oh then hope you

153
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:32,060
up on Rebecca trusted uh is any uh is

154
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:32,060
anyone done today I

155
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:44,359
I this playful has a weight so has

156
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:48,550
anyone got any like jSPL code java

157
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:51,500
template languages yeah little bit so

158
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:52,970
when the interesting games was up but in

159
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,070
order for the process with applaud

160
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:56,630
actually Peter you're not going to

161
00:06:55,070 --> 00:07:00,940
subtract straight through it to the

162
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:00,940
angular app maybe pile a'dope hooker

163
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:06,080
Wendy's habit is of an anchor jan spirit

164
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:09,020
of application to actually call itself

165
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,479
that gets a client-side paper is vexing

166
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:14,510
use on the client side and what happens

167
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:17,570
is if the developer has a page that the

168
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:20,690
JSP page versus interpolated basically

169
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:23,540
essentially compiled server side if they

170
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:26,420
have angularjs code in there then

171
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:31,070
expression stuff or your piping on some

172
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:34,280
of her e essentially is basically making

173
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:35,690
it vulnerable to process rivet if the

174
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,669
site is it's a new page application this

175
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:39,200
is brian on the client side it does the

176
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:40,730
HTML code all the expressions to be

177
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,400
operational podiums was no culpability

178
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:45,650
there well one of the very interesting

179
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:50,000
to me for the really interesting things

180
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:51,770
that I have now so here we have this

181
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,840
little English a sandbox all invisible

182
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:55,840
search function you can search for a

183
00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:01,970
company or whatever um but so what we

184
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:04,660
can do is we can see if we can try our

185
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:04,660
halo here

186
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:12,120
Robbie

187
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:23,650
let's do this I'm just doing this so now

188
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:32,890
you know I don't get any weird

189
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:36,929
characters all right so we can try the

190
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:39,789
typical you know home loss nomar one

191
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:45,609
that's wonderful it was just a test see

192
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:48,600
that ok then execute ok if you look at

193
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:48,600
this once code here that

194
00:08:56,209 --> 00:09:02,059
her now like with problem like you have

195
00:08:59,269 --> 00:09:03,829
to click on all the page I guess so you

196
00:09:02,059 --> 00:09:06,230
can see her that it is actually all

197
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:09,589
pretty pony property but this isn't

198
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:17,689
actually English s this is dr. beside

199
00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:19,939
via the Java template library and the so

200
00:09:17,689 --> 00:09:22,519
this is the this is the page views kind

201
00:09:19,939 --> 00:09:24,139
of standard surface I drama template

202
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:27,709
language structure here pretty great to

203
00:09:24,139 --> 00:09:35,660
the customers of the search box and then

204
00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:39,050
the natural result page again instance

205
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:41,929
in GSP if you see here there is no

206
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:46,809
English yes on us at all it's all java

207
00:09:41,929 --> 00:09:52,339
sort of template pages but we do have

208
00:09:46,809 --> 00:10:01,879
the JavaScript or angler GS o being

209
00:09:52,339 --> 00:10:04,670
included total signals but those make

210
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:06,439
use of language yes so I see this before

211
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:08,059
when developers are moving to English

212
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,618
yes from another paper so if at all

213
00:10:08,059 --> 00:10:12,860
times you can swap out everything city

214
00:10:09,619 --> 00:10:14,569
of eastvale well we have been shocked

215
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:16,339
director bootstrapping and also include

216
00:10:14,569 --> 00:10:18,829
the script source here and discipline of

217
00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:20,389
the plate to get angular to work so we

218
00:10:18,829 --> 00:10:22,339
do on the england vs scripting we leave

219
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:24,759
the page as well as angie app so it

220
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:26,839
would boost dropping a bomb that page so

221
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:29,029
you don't have to search results here

222
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:32,029
okay but there's no name is called SQL

223
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:35,740
server side stuff but you can see that

224
00:10:32,029 --> 00:10:35,740
you can trying to pin it out

225
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:46,230
see if you get a cross-site scripting

226
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:48,350
fall now what about health minute

227
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:54,420
because what this essentially is is that

228
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:57,000
we are able to team if those two

229
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:59,579
conditions is this if the ng op is there

230
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,430
a big boost wrap and then the template

231
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:04,980
thank God is being served up is also

232
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:06,510
done service on of user control the data

233
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:09,180
you don't have to use angularjs

234
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:11,939
expressions anymore because this we're

235
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:13,709
objecting into angularjs and use eval to

236
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:15,540
trigger that we're going to break

237
00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:18,060
the internet you have script and trigger

238
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:20,219
our feel that way so essentially what

239
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:22,050
this means is that any developer who's

240
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:24,470
moving to England she asks America

241
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:27,060
scripts in you know templated somewhere

242
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:28,529
that part out cash these vulnerable

243
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:32,989
cross-site scripting even though the are

244
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:36,750
doing HTML coding because the JSP stuff

245
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:38,130
but the CL that does HTML coding that

246
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,959
was what we just saw in without being

247
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:42,180
coded as a positive hope there are no

248
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:43,859
scanners I don't pick this up and this

249
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:47,819
could easily miss of us must go to you

250
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:48,930
because this is constantly so I thought

251
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,520
it was really interesting that wasn't

252
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:52,020
expecting that I thought like you have

253
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,480
to be using an English yes express

254
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:57,870
oneself on that page which we reduced it

255
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:01,560
but I'm creative I do make sense any

256
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:03,240
questions about that so far so do you

257
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:06,329
only indication that they use an angler

258
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:09,660
of the TL that's not a neighbor s that's

259
00:12:06,329 --> 00:12:12,239
only that's the gym javaserver template

260
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:14,910
library jSPL so like there's no able on

261
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,260
this page at all instead of for the NGF

262
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:19,529
directive and then the script that

263
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:21,209
includes angular asset to the page so

264
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:23,189
yeah unless you knew that they were

265
00:12:21,209 --> 00:12:25,619
using angular and knew that like this is

266
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:28,770
very probable that this was coming from

267
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:31,170
that the CL values were planning for

268
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:33,990
user control like what no this is olive

269
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:35,670
oil at all yeah so would you recommend

270
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:38,250
let's see you just get a whole I can zip

271
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:40,770
file code or code review just just prep

272
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:42,240
for mg app and find out where if it

273
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:43,589
exists and then locate it and then go

274
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,170
from there with that you want approach

275
00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:48,510
to try to be more efficient to focus it

276
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:50,610
zero in on those i think what i what i

277
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:52,410
would do is an understanding of the

278
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:55,230
applicator my views are sore

279
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:56,850
so you don't Diana if let's say you're

280
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:58,170
doing both you'll be going in for the

281
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:00,060
web but you also get the code as well

282
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:01,529
yes so what I would make sure I

283
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,359
understand like what's age or the

284
00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:05,550
life-sign poker it without part of

285
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,949
things and Virg yes you know my favorite

286
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:11,430
deviation how many theoretically we

287
00:13:07,949 --> 00:13:12,839
should have any templates being handled

288
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:14,609
service on the apprentice server side

289
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:16,529
and England just like this isn't

290
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:18,569
something that made control like this I

291
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:20,370
moment or ENSO a bit just because if you

292
00:13:18,569 --> 00:13:22,410
misuse by the developer so when i'm

293
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:24,060
looking to the girls 8 I start seeing

294
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:26,810
like okay with GSP pages and starting

295
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:28,800
like English a sort of using up a

296
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:31,680
plasticizer something else up there i

297
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,569
would start looking and see if that

298
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,878
script in geography is including

299
00:13:33,569 --> 00:13:37,469
everywhere it's only needed the root of

300
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:38,759
the elements where angular dress is

301
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:41,339
being applied you don't we needed up

302
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:42,870
enumeration this is some Rollins so you

303
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:45,480
did love let see there that hybrid stage

304
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:46,829
we're going from that to that with your

305
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,319
recommendation which make sure to get

306
00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:51,149
their own way or if I was in developer I

307
00:13:49,319 --> 00:13:55,219
probably try knowing this I would

308
00:13:51,149 --> 00:13:57,630
probably only include to be cuz we'll

309
00:13:55,220 --> 00:14:00,060
have a mere of an ipod inclusion

310
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:02,490
jennifer gets ripped AGG assault a to

311
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:04,130
wherever I needed it so what if i'm

312
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:05,639
using the uploader temple later

313
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:07,410
sometimes that's will be applied

314
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:09,720
everywhere the site i try and limit it

315
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:11,279
to America needs to be and then also

316
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,410
make sure that those resources that have

317
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:15,660
it or serve statically and about the

318
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:22,889
integrity name of a pre population on

319
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:25,649
the server side all right oh okay

320
00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:27,620
perfect so I'm going to move on to the

321
00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:32,480
hibrane yourself just be able to monitor

322
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:32,480
and quite a few more slides

323
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:54,640
okay uh wait so anyone falooda harmony

324
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:55,900
yeah it's pretty hard harmony is an

325
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,810
object-relational mapping tool for

326
00:14:55,900 --> 00:15:00,910
travel and it makes the database work in

327
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:03,849
the job and I'm really using essentially

328
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:05,500
what became in harmony for her comp pad

329
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:13,090
and essentially like people became

330
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:14,710
correctly but it's hard oh right sure

331
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:17,680
looking at this I was gonna pay myself

332
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:19,660
my phone these guys did some pretty paws

333
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,579
and this one's coming off I packed in

334
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:23,410
the boss 2016 day I'm looking for that

335
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:26,650
one hazira I think you getting some new

336
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:28,839
Ray's eagerness but I've got a lot of

337
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:35,980
work ahead remain like isn't over and I

338
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:37,690
already told work on ops and they know

339
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:40,530
this this guy here River not also has a

340
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:42,550
great presentation these sliders

341
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:44,740
references fees will get this on Jack

342
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:47,589
but this is not a really good one these

343
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:48,880
are very so they're very uh the are

344
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:53,800
decent amount of knowledge on your part

345
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:55,390
of your going to draw but so every all

346
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:58,479
traditional optical what it does is

347
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:59,980
essentially case files listed right

348
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,690
developers need to travel classes

349
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:06,880
instead of Brenda database directly to

350
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:09,190
select a nice impulse a cyst between RS

351
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:13,630
new album in our database where that is

352
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:15,520
workable most grasses and hibernate will

353
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:17,620
generate got sequel for us everything

354
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,730
else does a platform it's really

355
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:20,290
possible at informants if we want to

356
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:23,260
swap swap the ABA says help you don't

357
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:25,110
have to mess with right all and it is a

358
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:27,040
pretty good i'm performing and

359
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:28,180
especially if it did bathroom scale if

360
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,880
you're writing a web app and child your

361
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:33,250
pop music so here's an example what we

362
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:38,110
might even Oh left here we have a little

363
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:39,430
table little bottles of data here and on

364
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:42,190
the right be out of our customer class

365
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:44,290
and here is this a plain old java off

366
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:46,130
there's nothing special about this but

367
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:49,130
this is my house of representatives

368
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:51,110
in the top alone so there's the old kind

369
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:53,750
of old school way of dependency is still

370
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:55,280
a lot of legacy applications we have our

371
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,660
see full up here we're getting a

372
00:16:55,280 --> 00:17:00,290
statement with roommate impressions of

373
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:04,129
these second communi executed query the

374
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:09,109
CSU a new custom project Chum to see it

375
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:10,790
beyond result and then down here down

376
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:12,469
here we're getting the data from the

377
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:14,659
database now and we're studying all this

378
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:16,940
on there yeah this is a pretty simple

379
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:19,220
power amounts of elitism so powder that

380
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:22,100
is pretty well known and kind of

381
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:24,500
inspired the design of heart beating so

382
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:26,030
when I read eight though here's where is

383
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,650
what would like using the h2o math to

384
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:31,430
prepare communities by raiding party

385
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:32,840
language so you have a aconitine come

386
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:37,100
from somewhere so here's a each

387
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:38,959
bolstering see that it's a simple format

388
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,879
but we're also working with this custom

389
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,100
object is capital C business

390
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,780
representing our class so it allows us

391
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,340
how Yuki Scrolls an object-oriented

392
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:48,320
method to finger actually make

393
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:52,550
encouraging us on objects confidence

394
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:55,340
itself be recreated a creator query and

395
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:57,500
then the data and then we persecuted we

396
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:59,149
get the unique resolve and this is how

397
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,920
people to populate this constant object

398
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:02,630
for us so now we just have a custom

399
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:06,230
object work now to do any kind plug

400
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:07,910
additional happy the stuff here there so

401
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:10,850
this is what that cost looks like a

402
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:12,200
hybrid hybrid mapping supplying the

403
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:14,360
oranges annotations are going to fly on

404
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:17,240
the fastest a up to here this is how

405
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:19,760
this maps into the column of the put the

406
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:24,140
data type up your work in the solar

407
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:25,940
screen or acceptor um you girls do like

408
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:27,830
you know if you want to map like a joint

409
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:29,410
condition that there are also not too so

410
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:31,460
you can join one object to another

411
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:35,720
everyone take care of the eternal

412
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:37,970
mapping peoples have models so exploding

413
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,830
hibernate queries so I'm going for a

414
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:42,260
linkage is similar to see home it's not

415
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:44,840
really a super cetera subset but its

416
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:46,610
unrestricted what we can do is fully

417
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,620
object-oriented so developers working in

418
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:54,050
customer objects and user objects or

419
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:55,879
products not single birds and the HTML

420
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:58,159
language uses the objects the only about

421
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,270
properties along with their other

422
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,880
objects like

423
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:04,250
if the above object here I can applaud

424
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:09,320
game wasn't apt we couldn't punch out on

425
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:11,600
HTML and go here's our map objects

426
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,730
razandrich properties are comedy for

427
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:17,149
second jhana object because aliens

428
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:23,900
columns and that's essentially a very

429
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:26,750
simple HTML query but we also consume

430
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:28,850
people to injection just like regular

431
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,650
chain pc coder see polar actually a new

432
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:32,540
are formatted sequel statement office

433
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:34,550
drinking combination you can see that

434
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:39,050
the safety happens here where we have

435
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:42,710
the butler has built a site query out

436
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:44,810
but we're adjusting right into here as

437
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:47,330
usual controllable this is what the

438
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:48,860
injection would happen then don't

439
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:50,629
respond straight off to the create very

440
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:53,300
Paul announced needed counsel to the

441
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:56,900
database and then prepare even run so

442
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:58,669
this is what might look like if you are

443
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:01,340
testing something and i love the except

444
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:02,570
up here and obviously in a riddle but

445
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:06,740
what application popping up in his

446
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:09,439
factories like this I opened the uh-oh

447
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:12,560
care if you just inserted in a bowl this

448
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,930
is just a single tape just you all

449
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:16,669
coated single thing mark and just like

450
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:17,930
your own test for sequel injection boy

451
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:21,800
you'll notice here we get an assumption

452
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:23,540
is a hybrid a query exception to be

453
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:26,180
broke the HS well honest some fanciful

454
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:29,870
so child's play an exception about that

455
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:33,050
so you don't have an alibi full-scale he

456
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:36,169
hope if you fix it so this is a where

457
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:38,060
our queries been injected and you can

458
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:41,510
say okay hibernate grilling there's this

459
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:44,570
law firm of conditions of former and etc

460
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:46,670
and so we're going to try to reassess

461
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:48,350
apology here so that we can see

462
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:54,140
everything in the database what my

463
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:56,510
tables rod and so when they here's what

464
00:20:54,140 --> 00:21:00,410
our query or injections on the flight

465
00:20:56,510 --> 00:21:02,360
and then got to be mind that will be

466
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:03,590
injected here we don't have anything you

467
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,389
don't have to take control over in the

468
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:06,860
stuff here only what's here so we're

469
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:09,190
essentially fixing rested on queries

470
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,189
Ross

471
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:15,729
so we tried that and it checked out and

472
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:17,860
we'll see okay it worked no hardly any

473
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:23,470
first aid in here put as a valid HTML

474
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:25,360
statement so now at this point okay we

475
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:27,130
have an HTML injection but because of

476
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,929
limitations of age 12 there's only so

477
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:31,960
much we can do about your potentially

478
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:33,130
query or somehow enumerate columns and

479
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:35,080
properties on mountain air second

480
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:36,070
captain the locals are and if you don't

481
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:39,639
have the assumptions have been very

482
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:40,929
typically do that at the same time maybe

483
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,850
there's no juicy data that you can

484
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:44,260
access that way right you only work with

485
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:46,600
the mouse properties so we're trying

486
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,860
here at davids another table in David's

487
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,810
but that's not a percentage by the

488
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:50,919
application and can't access it I things

489
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:54,780
I've been able to develop Commission

490
00:21:50,920 --> 00:22:00,940
schema or unless for some reason

491
00:21:54,780 --> 00:22:04,210
developers but fortunately for us so we

492
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:07,150
don't need to order of that because all

493
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:08,530
of it will any of these HTML injections

494
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:10,630
we can actually create a sequel

495
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:14,379
injection awful hold on just read the

496
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:16,180
sequel injection so here we have Total

497
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:18,100
Film you essentially have the scroll

498
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:20,590
injection which is what you can solve

499
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:23,860
but then we also have to insert internet

500
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:27,820
a sequel injection and then is pass on

501
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:29,229
executed in database so it only make

502
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:32,800
this work a couple really just in case

503
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:35,110
here vm first two different escape

504
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:37,450
condoms of needed in to break out of the

505
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:41,199
HTML flexor and also to interpret to the

506
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:44,770
sequel to the first one in time page 12

507
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:47,440
of a slash is not America and h 12 uses

508
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:50,020
a single tape to escape two tix to civil

509
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,730
propecia marks you can find these to

510
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:53,470
break that age 12 Xers because we're

511
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:56,920
escaping this a single quote they can

512
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:59,260
use a telephone to book whose acetyl the

513
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:01,240
two textures escape one which the

514
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:03,100
backslash entities quals fine it's not

515
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:05,560
escaping anything during this past off

516
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:12,300
to the simple injection the backlash is

517
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:15,639
escaping a single pic actual people yes

518
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:17,500
so you see if you do that we get an

519
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,510
actual jdbc exception don't have minus

520
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:21,100
equal except right now bro cannot know

521
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:23,230
of any people a bubble and we're

522
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:27,639
actually executing did you see my

523
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:29,200
all see for my butt and at that point

524
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,390
just like the sandbox escape for

525
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,400
cross-site scripting language s may have

526
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:36,360
essentially an escape right we have a

527
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:39,910
poem that week analogous objection horny

528
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:42,729
but again the sequel itself is be valid

529
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:43,809
as well as each well if you can't break

530
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:45,940
you the one of those who sought to work

531
00:23:43,809 --> 00:23:48,428
and again yeah this is where it gets

532
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:52,630
tricky this is here on a second

533
00:23:48,429 --> 00:23:57,340
assumption reception um so again we're

534
00:23:52,630 --> 00:24:00,309
back to his normal Prairie pattern we're

535
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:03,280
back to the great pattern for before so

536
00:24:00,309 --> 00:24:04,690
this is where injection is going so

537
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:07,690
we're gonna start simple now I recommend

538
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:09,040
doing this if anyone does hi testing and

539
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:11,020
try to exploit seal interactions when

540
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,580
the person side view is trying my body

541
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:14,620
can come up let that very much look like

542
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:17,740
and start filling it up from there so

543
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:20,500
just place holder values etc so okay if

544
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:22,299
you have this injection for here so okay

545
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,470
well you'll try the simple thing you

546
00:24:22,299 --> 00:24:24,879
want their on this because maybe it's

547
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:26,710
not like you don't have a pretty wild

548
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,140
card on Yancy that's a lot to figure

549
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:33,820
that out but it'd be out of this in

550
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:36,429
there this is still h12 may be okay

551
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:38,350
beyond the results family I was expected

552
00:24:36,429 --> 00:24:41,140
because it's an you know it's not a true

553
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:44,020
statement so I hope this build upon it

554
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:47,290
but it's this column you know it's a

555
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:49,750
valid HTML / let's move on no okay let's

556
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:52,270
try and get into simple gesture so the

557
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:55,270
red is what we're actually conducting

558
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:58,750
the sequel now so we do our escape here

559
00:24:55,270 --> 00:25:00,100
let me have this people's one and then

560
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:01,990
we're just using the column character in

561
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:03,730
this you will probably come up anything

562
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:05,260
else that might be there and then we're

563
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:11,309
finishing off with a higher game just

564
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:14,279
like before two paragraphs a network now

565
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:15,658
so at this point because every walk with

566
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:17,549
their normal sequel injection now in

567
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:19,470
this example we might how the table as

568
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:21,809
displaying some data and look at the

569
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:23,220
news Audrey principal standard sequel

570
00:25:21,809 --> 00:25:25,860
injection the information concerning

571
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:27,720
that C sucking bro most effective name

572
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:32,178
you know it's now we can call the

573
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:32,179
database function I'm sequel to his name

574
00:25:33,019 --> 00:25:37,710
so you can see here that this is a

575
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:42,600
database name the baby C is our last

576
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:44,429
talk possibly on us we must do the

577
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:46,408
person you add this inherent Davis

578
00:25:44,429 --> 00:25:50,580
version just like before so there's a

579
00:25:46,409 --> 00:25:52,350
person there now to the same field here

580
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:54,899
now that's conscious typical sequel

581
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:56,219
injection here was nothing at this point

582
00:25:54,899 --> 00:25:58,320
health integrated to hibernate

583
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:04,950
multi-million age 12 we're disconnecting

584
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:07,259
the sequel injection so here's an

585
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:09,659
example what the actual produce age 12

586
00:26:07,259 --> 00:26:12,179
look like so if your audience knows it

587
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:16,499
was hired a new to see this I'll carry

588
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:18,230
long's the whole part is is that harmony

589
00:26:16,499 --> 00:26:21,539
is between this entire thing as a spring

590
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:23,490
this has all info lot of skating the

591
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:26,309
single for it's capable simple boat so

592
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:29,639
from here Owen here it's just a certain

593
00:26:26,309 --> 00:26:30,960
today it's not until the jdbc parts

594
00:26:29,639 --> 00:26:32,939
which are parsing if I becomes that

595
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:36,230
progressive aggression party it's not

596
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:38,730
necessarily an objection because we're

597
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:43,919
but we were jumping into the sequel be

598
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:47,039
produced by balaji strawberry so

599
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:49,470
prevention I'll to save a seat for

600
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:52,590
judgment like if you're in a sort of you

601
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:55,139
and you want prevent sequel injection is

602
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:58,649
the same thing loading the stream key

603
00:26:55,139 --> 00:27:04,219
copy of all parties that's it and if you

604
00:26:58,649 --> 00:27:10,379
look back at the initial example Prairie

605
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:11,820
doc um they have no just like main

606
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:15,119
parameters to change the see if you have

607
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:17,369
those the H code phrase as well and the

608
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:18,840
second County on those the thing is it's

609
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:20,789
not even just a security reason to do

610
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:24,059
that in hardening this actually will

611
00:27:20,789 --> 00:27:25,059
cash automatically that if you were

612
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,889
using straight to see

613
00:27:25,059 --> 00:27:28,360
what do that so the most of the time

614
00:27:26,889 --> 00:27:29,949
developers do miss editors because it

615
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:32,158
provides performance reasons for doing

616
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:32,159
so

617
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:52,039
oh that's like it's okay yeah in

618
00:27:47,179 --> 00:27:53,600
parameters oh and there's no reason not

619
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:55,580
to use of right I mean it just that's

620
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,399
not good each girl is not necessarily

621
00:27:55,580 --> 00:28:00,379
involve a to allow a hybrid allowance to

622
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:02,928
use to query the database it does have

623
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:05,178
the criterion API which is perfect or

624
00:28:02,929 --> 00:28:07,159
two very identity dangers like

625
00:28:05,179 --> 00:28:09,799
construction and you said doesn't it

626
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:13,100
using as well there's different reasons

627
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:15,440
for using one or gonna go so doing a

628
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:18,019
source code review and there's a great I

629
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,750
want to look for of any poles to create

630
00:28:18,019 --> 00:28:24,100
Marie or crazy hooker okay too small of

631
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:26,120
each coil springs so it could be tip of

632
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:27,740
potentially vulnerable to the separate

633
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,789
injection you did not the book the CEO

634
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:30,590
people words in each goes from a

635
00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:32,480
plumbing problem to end user control the

636
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:34,610
kid are the destruction that you scroll

637
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,950
for the st. manners or the other Nets

638
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:38,809
not adhering is also in you needed at

639
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:42,500
the end of medications because I'm will

640
00:28:38,809 --> 00:28:44,210
take where hibernate the construction

641
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:46,129
will go down the developers way while

642
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:47,899
you just run straight native simple and

643
00:28:46,129 --> 00:28:50,600
just pass the survey top through so if

644
00:28:47,899 --> 00:28:52,070
you have a very somewhere okay I had

645
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:54,379
thought that phrase doing and how it's

646
00:28:52,070 --> 00:29:00,289
being destructive actually also detected

647
00:28:54,379 --> 00:29:04,939
this version to any question needs to

648
00:29:00,289 --> 00:29:10,158
that seems like that's a technique of

649
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:11,539
using it oh yeah yep I'm focused

650
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:14,120
hibernating solo I have a bad experience

651
00:29:11,539 --> 00:29:16,190
with but essentially yeah and some of

652
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:21,879
the other science they've done through

653
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:21,879
like I think I've had as a grenade and

654
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:30,379
so one of the things I've been working

655
00:29:26,059 --> 00:29:32,149
on is exploiting this no I have a little

656
00:29:30,379 --> 00:29:33,649
hungry test app that disability

657
00:29:32,149 --> 00:29:36,139
allowance exceptions to go through

658
00:29:33,649 --> 00:29:39,469
service or work with the real world is

659
00:29:36,139 --> 00:29:40,610
most likely to get mine detection and if

660
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:45,019
you're doing a single injection of it

661
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:49,820
was really hard to explain however there

662
00:29:45,019 --> 00:29:52,640
was a so are closing stuff up so I got

663
00:29:49,820 --> 00:30:03,220
some time here so what

664
00:29:52,640 --> 00:30:03,220
this around here yes

665
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:26,740
so I felt very soon Ralph is actually

666
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,780
saying one that I want party so my

667
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:31,420
primary sandbox area allows this is not

668
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:33,190
sure for things and so we can try this

669
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:36,040
out and say okay here's our customary

670
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:40,000
whole principle tick in there yeah get

671
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:44,649
that 500 and very accept you just like

672
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:49,240
new song slides and try our other folk

673
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:51,340
here we have interception but if you

674
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:56,920
slow down we also see that young people

675
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:59,620
GPC are sequels impacts exception so we

676
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:05,560
say okay let's that's acceptable new T

677
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:07,149
Bo traction and signal map now is just

678
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:14,080
before I put on this right held at this

679
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:15,820
house work um sequel have run under the

680
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:21,370
right conditions will actually pick up

681
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:23,139
that that's injectable however you have

682
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:30,179
to bottom with a bum bum of green on

683
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:30,180
briscoe 5i uncle Teddy

684
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:35,530
yes baby

685
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:49,220
ultramar target for the side note yeah

686
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:51,860
yeah you for local I use the projector

687
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:56,860
that they another us of high off

688
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:56,860
resolution of this blows

689
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:08,429
you

690
00:32:11,549 --> 00:32:20,989
oh thank you I go to I can't see my type

691
00:32:21,049 --> 00:32:29,809
that's you quick huh Oh gonna love max

692
00:32:32,419 --> 00:32:36,869
so if you run this without the level of

693
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:38,459
the rest specifications in a mole find

694
00:32:36,869 --> 00:32:45,299
anything I'll say it's not injectable

695
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:53,730
but it takes if you mess it up now it's

696
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:54,989
all fun so level 5 plus 3 time alright

697
00:32:53,730 --> 00:33:00,869
so let's go through here to drill

698
00:32:54,989 --> 00:33:02,549
seriousness and actually blood on and so

699
00:33:00,869 --> 00:33:05,070
money this way it will point out that

700
00:33:02,549 --> 00:33:10,440
hey this kurtis parameters they played

701
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:12,749
like el pelo this is from work so get

702
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,700
ready cheers normal no don't touch

703
00:33:12,749 --> 00:33:17,429
anything else hurry up however though at

704
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:18,809
this point no it's just pure luck in

705
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:22,769
coincidence that i actually found that

706
00:33:18,809 --> 00:33:27,029
reason why is because halo is using its

707
00:33:22,769 --> 00:33:28,830
still following each club right so it's

708
00:33:27,029 --> 00:33:30,210
only a 2 just happen upon you scroll in

709
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:32,939
church it doesn't involve with a sequel

710
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:36,359
touch necessary so if you're trying to

711
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:39,239
exploit this bike jump all like that's

712
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:41,129
something um it's going to essentially

713
00:33:39,239 --> 00:33:42,570
get some error it says that if they

714
00:33:41,129 --> 00:33:46,799
can't do it because here you to the

715
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:50,249
Gators this is all access so it doesn't

716
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:52,200
want to get um now I've been trying to

717
00:33:50,249 --> 00:33:54,149
get a hustle payload and to go about to

718
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:56,489
work if anyone comes to Prague let's try

719
00:33:54,149 --> 00:33:59,129
it out I have a bill and actually

720
00:33:56,489 --> 00:34:00,450
creating work oh and I know like see

721
00:33:59,129 --> 00:34:02,459
bolte hobe a plunge to create your own

722
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:07,259
payloads you can specify the injection

723
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:09,690
point but uh I just wanted the fountain

724
00:34:07,259 --> 00:34:11,819
got the recipe and the work on it for a

725
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:14,579
photographer features here now public

726
00:34:11,819 --> 00:34:15,690
public goods bought this week and there

727
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:17,399
was this one day I'm still working on I

728
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:19,500
mean get on to figure it out at some

729
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:22,618
point but how would that make that's

730
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:25,069
completely easy to to explain to people

731
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:25,069
tripping

732
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:39,679
alright cool remember you have a cigar

733
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:42,020
thoughts on you decided the yes any

734
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:47,810
questions you want like a low-cost irate

735
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:49,040
that female exploit any way but it's a

736
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:50,899
problem I like this nice little

737
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,969
instruction at the same time because of

738
00:34:50,899 --> 00:34:55,040
the nature of the language and framework

739
00:34:52,969 --> 00:34:57,740
it's actually hard to find attractive

740
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:01,310
all everything actually look up

741
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:03,290
involving perceptions it was partially

742
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:05,029
card pockets of salty but again my

743
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:07,160
google sees where developers have a very

744
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:09,590
high rate of all big we have to use the

745
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:13,190
tool correctly right but it especially

746
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:14,840
smells good oh that's awfully high iron

747
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:16,250
point flip book before i'm just going to

748
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,710
realize that like I can actually can't

749
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:21,140
get to your full on simple correction

750
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:22,790
ourselves have it but apparently people

751
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:24,560
this some of these slides the research

752
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:27,170
these guys they just came out like he

753
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:29,600
just posted slide so I think but the bid

754
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:31,130
last year or last year so it's not to

755
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:33,230
fit health care that's only thing I can

756
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:34,730
find on it at all cuz I'm sorry I'm kind

757
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:36,619
of digging around and I became a possum

758
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:42,770
about this is awesome to make the

759
00:35:36,619 --> 00:35:45,650
argument and so i will put are these

760
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:48,259
little progress a very support I just

761
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:52,220
don't feel facility to test this stuff

762
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:55,940
here when I will put them up online I

763
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:58,040
think ur you're not updated if they are

764
00:35:55,940 --> 00:36:00,619
but if I could help Project Blue poems

765
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:05,690
on other 17 outfit all hope I'm updated

766
00:36:00,619 --> 00:36:08,080
i'll keep it out so Stephen look at the

767
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:08,080
TV

768
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:18,120
e

769
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:25,170
so see that the app that actually is

770
00:36:35,140 --> 00:37:13,420
oh so whatever do I start small and work

771
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:18,879
on filling whatever queria triangle here

772
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:24,910
to log off on pieces like that because

773
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:26,740
it's important so now we like hair so

774
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:29,410
that so they're here at this point

775
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:31,450
though we can do the rest of our

776
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:33,850
objection so I pay them so we could do

777
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:35,770
that you hit I'll show you I'll just

778
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:37,089
show you this if anyone is interested so

779
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:39,700
we're going to union select theaters at

780
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:41,290
this point we don't know where something

781
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:43,870
very very same table if you don't know

782
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:46,630
how many columns or are you able to even

783
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:48,250
know it got a query being on has three

784
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:49,660
columns or four columns we need to help

785
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:52,300
the day they have the same number

786
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:53,710
columns so one of the days I'm you know

787
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:55,780
once you find a single charge and you

788
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:57,190
starting right itself will start trying

789
00:37:55,780 --> 00:38:01,450
to figure out how many of those columns

790
00:37:57,190 --> 00:38:05,920
are just pressing assumption educated

791
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:08,160
custom mom so if you forgot to search

792
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,160
here

793
00:38:14,299 --> 00:38:20,869
so here we kind of made it such a good

794
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:22,489
subject look at it you could have see

795
00:38:20,869 --> 00:38:24,140
that okay the salon state of Kentucky

796
00:38:22,489 --> 00:38:27,170
benefit balls so from there well let's

797
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:29,569
co-op in you can do it get out our

798
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:31,789
personal column here and I always kind

799
00:38:29,569 --> 00:38:36,130
of do so but just our piecemeal and

800
00:38:31,789 --> 00:38:36,130
other Street columns so I'll show that

801
00:38:39,849 --> 00:38:44,059
their networks pronounced heat up

802
00:38:41,989 --> 00:38:45,589
because it use if you overload what data

803
00:38:44,059 --> 00:38:48,319
is being pulled out so if it's it ok

804
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:50,299
ideas flowing font name field as a third

805
00:38:48,319 --> 00:38:54,288
parameter that apparently the developer

806
00:38:50,299 --> 00:38:56,089
is queria subsidy third piece here and

807
00:38:54,289 --> 00:38:58,189
the economies of seconds so now we know

808
00:38:56,089 --> 00:39:00,019
what the data is going concern of doing

809
00:38:58,189 --> 00:39:04,038
that stuff we could say okay well I want

810
00:39:00,019 --> 00:39:05,928
to know the database version or the

811
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:07,729
database name and then third version of

812
00:39:05,929 --> 00:39:10,339
the database we use if I see hold the

813
00:39:07,729 --> 00:39:12,169
outer function is built which is cold

814
00:39:10,339 --> 00:39:13,578
doesn't so there's no built-in function

815
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:19,400
is HTML like that except for a few

816
00:39:13,579 --> 00:39:21,410
lengths acts or purchase I've got did

817
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,819
you everybody in stock tht handling it's

818
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:25,269
propagating this all from the HTML

819
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:25,269
