1
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:11,990
welcome to bsides Boston 2016 this is

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:14,690
our poor family law vs law student

3
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:17,198
projects when we've had also about some

4
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:19,850
so glad you guys were able to get to it

5
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,650
I like to pretend they're for speakers

6
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:23,000
morning the common ground support I

7
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:26,570
guess 10 years of professional

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,939
experience originated in startups with

9
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:31,419
information for all principal of the

10
00:00:28,939 --> 00:00:33,350
committee has a PhD from Cambridge

11
00:00:31,419 --> 00:00:36,559
University and computational

12
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:39,680
neuroscience his affiliations with MIT

13
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,300
and see Larry University NASCAR work

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,640
here that he will be presented to us as

15
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,709
information your own product designer on

16
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:54,129
some similar convergence thank you so

17
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:59,149
much I don't was it good hey partner so

18
00:00:54,129 --> 00:01:01,210
so today's topic is present you and you

19
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:05,720
in design framework for product event

20
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:08,450
call it the permission the lack of a

21
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,740
better word but I must admit this the

22
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:20,750
first time I'm giving this house is

23
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:22,310
still good friend I'm doing um so let's

24
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:24,670
give you a bit of context because why

25
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:27,260
I'm quietening it's an important topic I

26
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:29,870
think there is a shortage of scope you

27
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:32,890
look around folks estimates the 13

28
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:35,720
million cybersecurity dr. open right now

29
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:37,820
both white and you know in a couple of

30
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:41,090
here I know right that's what I was not

31
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:43,009
a catch that's what I was thinking and

32
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:47,030
then a couple of years it will be six

33
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:51,080
million oh that's why I didn't mess I

34
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:54,560
think so you know six million job

35
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:58,150
openings it's pretty if you have a work

36
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,150
ahead of you will not

37
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:08,679
and insane potatoes and you know is that

38
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:10,479
you can see the best job in the world I

39
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:15,010
don't know what any one of you regret

40
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:17,910
not getting sand inside that so so that

41
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:21,040
was definitely gambling skills right now

42
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:23,200
foreseeable future and so this talk is a

43
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,910
little bit about how to reach this gasps

44
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,679
how to kind of educate product

45
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:29,230
management so it takes its main legal

46
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:37,810
product minute but hopefully use it

47
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:40,750
security so so let me give you a little

48
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:43,239
bit of background on further planning

49
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:45,160
and acknowledge that there on the free

50
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:47,470
books and be honest I think they are on

51
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,640
two different frameworks it seems like

52
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:53,530
every big company has their own

53
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:56,890
framework sav has one IBM at one I don't

54
00:02:53,530 --> 00:03:00,670
know if it doesn't it work even google

55
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:02,828
has their own design framework you know

56
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:07,660
like legislating one particular one in

57
00:03:02,829 --> 00:03:10,150
this case I like Stanford framework it's

58
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:12,010
also used by I do hope design thinking

59
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:13,630
is very popular so just to give you a

60
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:15,670
clip like what what our design framework

61
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:17,829
let's go through one of them and you

62
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:20,950
know that much maybe works for us to get

63
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:24,069
that much early in the morning so let's

64
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:26,768
go to cooperating um so design framework

65
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:30,670
design thinking consists out of four

66
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:33,010
stages intuitively well if you start

67
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:34,899
with anything and attempt to find the

68
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:37,358
progress your idea to put a couple of

69
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:42,910
solutions and then you start protocol

70
00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:45,669
let me do you so I went to Japan and I

71
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:48,668
work in a start-up and let's see what we

72
00:03:45,669 --> 00:03:50,650
can help the Japanese with technologies

73
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:53,560
and one of the ideas that we had like

74
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:55,030
how can we teach kids to hope you know

75
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,739
it's a popular thing nowadays everyone

76
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:59,169
will go to the same thing like last

77
00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:02,319
issue of how to code something to get

78
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:04,720
any runs so in the beginning and went

79
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:08,649
terribly wrong so what what is then went

80
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:12,970
from a couple of ideas it's probably too

81
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:15,190
complicated talking so yeah so maybe it

82
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:16,899
was too complicated but I mean I mean

83
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:22,600
it's kids so we kind of adjusted it so

84
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:24,940
sir the kids hated this problem somebody

85
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,380
keep going and you are going for the

86
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:28,419
kids right now but to think about

87
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:30,550
Japanese kids if it's this it's there

88
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:32,979
are some specific right what what could

89
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:36,520
be specific about Japanese get that kind

90
00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:39,669
of made it different or Japanese people

91
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:41,500
environment culture okay more telling

92
00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:43,780
you amor giving you be the one giving

93
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,340
you people read things like that so so

94
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:47,138
that's the part of empathy right so you

95
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:49,479
want to a handful size and presence then

96
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:53,020
what is happening ideal even before you

97
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:55,690
feel and you know that's why this record

98
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:57,490
popular so it is analogies the program

99
00:04:55,690 --> 00:05:00,479
that happens in the COS days of testing

100
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:02,710
was we didn't take some Japanese money's

101
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,780
right so there's nothing funny about

102
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:06,580
this really eat them they think

103
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:08,650
apartment producer grade isn't like the

104
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:11,500
rural state government drop anything

105
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:13,900
engineers out in mechanics and you do

106
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:16,030
this you if you disappointed them so

107
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:18,849
it's a cultural change and I'm sure you

108
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:20,919
then so once you divide this problem

109
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:22,360
like that right then you can understand

110
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:23,859
like okay so we still want to do coding

111
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,080
we think this is the right thing to do

112
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:28,300
but we do have a problem in we empathize

113
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,698
with what the proper ones and so then

114
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:34,120
you can start iterating on top of it and

115
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:36,430
so what we did is we decided to do and

116
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,259
think about robots right I run into them

117
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:41,590
like Robert so we say okay there are 0

118
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:42,639
to focus manipulative robots right so

119
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:44,590
we'll teach you how to manipulate

120
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,259
movement and the mothers hospital a

121
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:48,818
great thing and encoding was just a side

122
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:53,979
effect as it turns out community

123
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:58,840
property so we can sleep as an example

124
00:05:53,979 --> 00:06:01,389
of it is entering the framework that we

125
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:04,030
focus on today is information is based

126
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:06,900
on information theory just kind of by a

127
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,900
show of hands how many

128
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:13,049
all right I mean it's very cool thing

129
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,270
you know like I did background and

130
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:17,310
conditional universe anything it's like

131
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:19,620
one of the really good theories that's

132
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:23,850
how the brain works how to work with it

133
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:25,169
so it wasn't meant like what China he

134
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,780
recently celebrated course obviously

135
00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:29,190
this happy birthday but I learned

136
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,799
everything from dating the kind who's

137
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:34,229
gonna very famous guy and also

138
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:37,800
unfortunately died this year so it's

139
00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:40,260
kind of my way commemorating the main

140
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:44,880
point of information theory is this

141
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:46,250
equation so H the letters that they use

142
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,780
to kind of summarize the with

143
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:50,940
information and he is the probability of

144
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:53,010
the events that I have so it's a

145
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:55,139
function of probability so let me give

146
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:59,820
you a couple of examples we can make it

147
00:06:55,139 --> 00:07:03,919
most businesses so imagine your door and

148
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:06,630
other liberal you come cheap coming up

149
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,520
so you have one she coming up one might

150
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:10,169
even otherwise even otherwise you and

151
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,849
they keep coming on and you like okay a

152
00:07:10,169 --> 00:07:22,109
lot of white sheep i'm pretty bored

153
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:28,849
achievement I when she and so imagine

154
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:31,590
that something oh yeah just like that

155
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:34,650
okay well I mean good is this for this

156
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:36,840
thing with on actually invest the so

157
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:38,159
they keep coming up and you you can't

158
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:41,010
the ship the first shape searching

159
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:42,419
closer and then suddenly instead of one

160
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:44,370
of the white shapes a black sheet comes

161
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:45,810
up you've never seen the flexion wheel

162
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:47,070
and while that's a big surprise so

163
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:49,320
information and kind of a measure of

164
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:51,510
surprised like you have something that

165
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:53,849
came out with a low probability there's

166
00:07:51,510 --> 00:08:05,360
there's a type information carrying

167
00:07:53,849 --> 00:08:05,360
event attention um I think the password

168
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:16,710
scary going Wow look too short all right

169
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:19,710
yeah it's a temporary password is Lucas

170
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:28,049
I'm in excuse everything everything this

171
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:30,330
is a good so information is method of

172
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:37,500
the probability and the low probability

173
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:39,478
events carry the most information it

174
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:44,430
doesn't really like the slide oh maybe

175
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:46,440
it is so the main point about

176
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:47,640
information theory is a very peculiar

177
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,530
property of information through

178
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:53,520
purchases it doesn't really care about

179
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:55,110
the value of the event so it's only

180
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,470
cares about the probability something

181
00:08:55,110 --> 00:09:00,090
has more value to you than less value it

182
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:03,030
doesn't incorporate that so if you like

183
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:05,100
black she's touching me like that right

184
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:06,569
so let me give you another example so

185
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,970
you have this white sheep coming on and

186
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:11,010
they keep coming out of this door and

187
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:13,290
then some nails of the store jumps a big

188
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:15,480
tagging right so the first thing that I

189
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:18,030
did get the hell out of print well so

190
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,410
Tiger makes a big difference versus a

191
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:23,100
black sheep right leg shape I exciting

192
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:26,040
for tigers on a more valuable to me it

193
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:28,020
then but information theory doesn't

194
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,520
capture it so this is kind of the key

195
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:31,079
property this is the reason why we use

196
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:34,439
information satirical for this product

197
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:38,120
design is because we're saying we will

198
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:41,190
not a prior arrest assign any value to

199
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:43,020
to the information we will not say this

200
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:45,300
information is more valuable than done

201
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:46,980
we'll just say we don't know what the

202
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:50,520
values information about through the

203
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:53,880
old-fashioned Olympic sensible anyone

204
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:58,380
has questions about me while we learned

205
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:59,850
about projector slides I really just

206
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,620
background for this presentation I

207
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:05,490
normally hits less but then you stand

208
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:08,910
with like strange accent so so let me

209
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:11,250
give you an example of how information

210
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:14,040
driven product design can contribute to

211
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:15,779
kind of the data sets father right so

212
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,969
back in the day she is been working in

213
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:21,449
in a matchmaking company less dating

214
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:24,329
question goes and so we have nine ten

215
00:10:21,449 --> 00:10:26,040
minute Lions win it for the job and the

216
00:10:24,329 --> 00:10:27,388
turquoise to to mention them and I was

217
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:38,160
the paper scientist who created the

218
00:10:27,389 --> 00:10:42,059
solver so you know how many furious no

219
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:44,850
you know there is my friend this so

220
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:47,100
before they tow sentences so when I came

221
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:48,540
into this company they had loads of it

222
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,180
and they had all this information today

223
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:53,430
and they had like the names of the

224
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:56,248
people the location whether the like

225
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:58,819
cats or dogs work what's the color they

226
00:10:56,249 --> 00:11:02,610
expected the celery like all of us and

227
00:10:58,819 --> 00:11:04,469
and we came in and we started analyzing

228
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:06,149
this in turn up none of this was

229
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:09,930
actually important to to do the

230
00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:11,430
measuring 450 kilograms right I looked

231
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:12,899
in with her then I realized the only

232
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:16,410
thing that was really critical for

233
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:18,449
success was the ecstasy of you know how

234
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:22,189
to do the login for us to the respond I

235
00:11:18,449 --> 00:11:22,189
mean I call it kind of focus for that

236
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,850
and you know like just a personal tip if

237
00:11:25,589 --> 00:11:28,500
you were wondering my know in response

238
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:30,480
to your tender try to change infected

239
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,519
I'm not saying that that's what they use

240
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,269
it in for a different activity two very

241
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:37,860
strong practice so so the main point of

242
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:39,930
this example under I'm just going to go

243
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,399
through a lot of product design examples

244
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:44,430
and show you how information will print

245
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:46,259
the main point of this example is when I

246
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:49,258
came in none of the engineers in this

247
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:51,439
entire technology was recording any of

248
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:54,180
this day because there were like here we

249
00:11:51,439 --> 00:11:55,529
we care about cans we care about celery

250
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,059
would care about your nail but they

251
00:11:55,529 --> 00:11:59,399
didn't really understand that if you

252
00:11:57,059 --> 00:12:03,120
report all this data in the background

253
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:04,679
you can actually filter today because

254
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,449
that's not how product managers thing so

255
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:08,850
that's kind of the idea of information

256
00:12:06,449 --> 00:12:11,429
through a particular do not a prior I

257
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:14,339
think that there is valuable information

258
00:12:11,429 --> 00:12:16,769
and less value you will never know you

259
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:18,389
know the distance you will never know

260
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:20,399
what really correlate just make sure

261
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:25,540
that you record all of it and it will

262
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:31,430
voice so let me give you another example

263
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:36,699
yeah so far so far the living on onto

264
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:39,680
the back he did for activity oh right um

265
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:41,750
so let's see so that was the first

266
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:45,430
example rights with a dissenting coupled

267
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:45,430
with a matchmaking where we stay where

268
00:12:48,580 --> 00:13:02,630
we say record all the information a

269
00:12:52,540 --> 00:13:05,900
painting so maximize the information

270
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:07,670
that you think a record everything and

271
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:09,680
of course the caveat get is refer those

272
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:13,370
information that you can as long as it

273
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:15,020
doesn't impede a character from any

274
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:16,850
questions and it uses like all men and

275
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:18,140
women separately you can record

276
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:20,120
information in the background without

277
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:22,130
kind of stopping the user from

278
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:25,580
experiencing a good product that's the

279
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:27,560
best and let me get this so you have to

280
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:29,480
perform however this is the sorry

281
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,910
success criteria have you ever had on

282
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:33,530
this one so that's the same like when

283
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:36,290
you're designing the product don't think

284
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:37,819
about the bell gertie don't don't think

285
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:39,650
like you're the biggest edges and you

286
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:41,360
will know what to report right then i

287
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:43,310
have the same thing like I you didn't

288
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,680
and I thought that I know what the

289
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:48,260
report well I'm not even working again

290
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,300
oh you're sharing a 40 pots dad yo

291
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:52,400
what's good Rick correct but would eat

292
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:54,199
right there oh no it just it's always

293
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:59,180
different right okay let me give you a

294
00:13:54,200 --> 00:14:01,190
Mexican hey let's face it it's a company

295
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:02,689
right this is making my koala my exit

296
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:05,300
the predictor that we want to do is how

297
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:07,450
to optimize the money to her right right

298
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:10,640
right yeah I guess what I'm saying is

299
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:15,080
thinking about you're saying like

300
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:17,720
waffles but all that behind but you also

301
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:19,400
do make the decision on front of what

302
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,060
your success criteria books don't know

303
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:24,530
about your ego good you know okay

304
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:26,060
because you will never know the co comes

305
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:28,250
to you and if they say we will use a

306
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:30,170
girls instead of rubbing oh and then

307
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:32,710
you're like okay I'll demet aight i'm

308
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:36,189
really good hungry

309
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:38,530
so so that's the thing like what what do

310
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:41,470
they move this talk to create a system

311
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:43,810
that kind of reduces the shortage of the

312
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:46,210
cyber security and gave us if we were in

313
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:48,369
a contagious dentist they will tell you

314
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:49,870
but how do they know right I wasn't it a

315
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:52,750
sentence I came and I didn't know what

316
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:54,670
it cookin up so don't build the products

317
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:57,400
access know the product if enabled it

318
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:59,880
let me here we go maybe a more

319
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:02,650
interesting you come this is from 2011

320
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:04,120
probably many of you have heard of it so

321
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:07,240
you can't detect the person from the

322
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:10,750
history was postmortem how many of you

323
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:12,970
know but yeah I hope so that's another

324
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:16,090
surprising thing right so we had all

325
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:17,770
this data for four years in basically

326
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:19,660
for quite a lot of time right and then

327
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:22,360
somebody comes in and starts looking

328
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:24,850
into features and it turns out we can

329
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,470
predict it very well right dependent it

330
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:29,110
doesn't depend on how fast the person is

331
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:30,370
I think none of the stuff that makes

332
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:33,040
them so the person is diving in

333
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:35,020
dependence on the gaps that you create

334
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,150
the features that you created in between

335
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:39,790
today specifically structured Internet

336
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:42,100
no one knew muck same thing with mouse

337
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:45,010
me right so quite a lot of companies do

338
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:48,750
right now mouse movements to detect

339
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:53,470
whether it's a real person logging in

340
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:55,330
and sometimes I feel good I think so

341
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:57,610
this was the two examples of unicron's

342
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:59,680
data sent how if you want to do

343
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:01,120
information from product is it do not be

344
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,969
partially do not think that you know

345
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,830
better just record everything as long as

346
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:07,840
it doesn't if you do it's a shame you

347
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:11,040
don't happen in screen but um have you

348
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:14,590
ever seen a law get feel friend so I

349
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:17,650
know so when you look in back in the

350
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:19,060
days what the response was if you missed

351
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:26,650
that the email of the password because

352
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:28,180
you're a do you know so then it does

353
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:29,920
could change the little bit and people

354
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:32,020
were saying well you showed you to

355
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,969
expose this information to the user you

356
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:35,410
shouldn't tell them that this evil

357
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:39,370
doesn't exist because then that gas

358
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:40,930
moving the genomics it turns out my I

359
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:44,020
hope this is like it give I thought this

360
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:45,599
is like foundation of cybersecurity but

361
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:48,060
if you actually going to

362
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,009
Facebook Google in linked it right now

363
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:53,430
they actually tell you that this account

364
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:56,750
doesn't it so the only company that's

365
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:59,040
that actually does not tell you that and

366
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:00,420
and you know I mean so this is the

367
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,089
classical examples of back in the day

368
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:05,819
you didn't want to expose this one bit

369
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:07,799
of information this is this one extra

370
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:09,899
bit saying that this email and password

371
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:11,039
condition is it just one extra bit and

372
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:14,910
so that that's how you should think

373
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:16,470
about it one little bit medals from set

374
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:18,329
of screws and you know I mean this is

375
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:20,370
data leakage it's been around for years

376
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:22,260
like if your cyber security you find a

377
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:24,359
port but what product management if they

378
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:27,119
don't think with it and let me give you

379
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:30,959
a more relevant example um the battery

380
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:32,908
is yang 05 how many have photos that we

381
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,750
can fingerprint a person based on their

382
00:17:32,909 --> 00:17:39,539
better each other yeah so let's it puts

383
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:42,020
out 15 so relatively reason that it's

384
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:45,150
very cool so it's based on your battery

385
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:48,150
you can see which person is accessing

386
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:50,070
your website and you can track them

387
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:52,799
according to the website that then exit

388
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:54,200
and the reason why it quite wipe this

389
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,929
one is it because the battery

390
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:59,640
information is using a float number

391
00:17:56,929 --> 00:18:02,520
which has a very strong a big precision

392
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:04,200
so you come in you have this battery

393
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,460
discharge that has a big number and then

394
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,500
you go to another website that people

395
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:10,890
say okay it's the same person with the

396
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:12,630
same bat very level 22 this different so

397
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:15,030
the only thing that you have to do to

398
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:18,570
fix it is instead of reporting it as a

399
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:21,690
load report the decision that's a very

400
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:23,010
simple thing to do that's how they fix

401
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:24,480
is likely to be there was no discussion

402
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:26,700
after this guy's figure the data they

403
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,890
they basically change from flow to an

404
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,270
end and everything was time but this is

405
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:32,570
the type of thinking that you need to do

406
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:35,190
right you need to this thinking and my

407
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:39,408
well am I giving one bit of information

408
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:43,260
away like literally every bit matter

409
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:44,820
that kind of mixing and this is how kind

410
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,200
of the books like when you when you

411
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:48,210
combine these good things right so

412
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:52,049
what's the difference between this login

413
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:54,690
screen at this blog entry Google can

414
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:56,908
actually track all the information then

415
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:58,250
they can they keep the store everything

416
00:18:56,909 --> 00:19:00,800
like that II

417
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:02,780
the timing when you login everything

418
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:05,000
right and so the great some sort of i

419
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:07,490
don't know i mean upset about ten

420
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,400
standard practices but they attract some

421
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:12,620
photo is this the right user and if you

422
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,960
are above a certain scholar then they

423
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:16,879
kind of show you your future and show

424
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,500
you the email that you love me so you're

425
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,930
coming up and they stay hey here is your

426
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,580
name is your signature please put in the

427
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:24,860
password but if you're below a certain

428
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:26,899
score than them so that's kind of you

429
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:28,280
know in education information from a

430
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:31,480
product with and when you record

431
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:33,530
everything you can cuz storage is free

432
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:36,200
don't don't think of storage in the

433
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:39,620
problems and then you use that to kind

434
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:44,780
of adjust how much information to expose

435
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:45,919
and combat you so that's kind of so

436
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:49,910
that's kind of the first part of the

437
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:51,440
talk oh well you know like i showed you

438
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:55,880
how information current product you that

439
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:57,620
can help you with beta sign when you say

440
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:00,470
i want to report all the information

441
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:02,090
again and how you can do it's for cyber

442
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:04,040
security where you want to minimize the

443
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:06,800
information that you exposed to them to

444
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:26,120
the user right so that that kind of my

445
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:28,430
summer and precious so nobody everything

446
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,929
like required randomly recordable all

447
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:32,300
the things that you can report and then

448
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:35,570
double in it is like this hiking when

449
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:37,700
you want to go for hanging video now as

450
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:47,419
far as making analytics and we sir km it

451
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:49,730
is called a bottom wall well look at me

452
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:52,550
so this is different oh yeah that's what

453
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:55,340
I love ya but but they've done the same

454
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:57,889
way the key is no to focus with that

455
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:59,899
because I give you an example of a long

456
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:02,990
time that was all this super West energy

457
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:06,170
right let's have this they then let's

458
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:09,650
read predict this get one Mary so right

459
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:11,480
now there's another direction of

460
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:13,520
consequences right so if you were

461
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:16,429
focused on that stuff hold it you were

462
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,379
creating might be not actually that you

463
00:21:16,429 --> 00:21:19,820
so that's kind of the thing like if you

464
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:22,460
start thinking about my ship without

465
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:28,240
working with on use you will kind of

466
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:30,830
miss out on over because the algorithmic

467
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:34,580
and you know i mean like this way you

468
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:36,740
kind of have a history of with it but i

469
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:38,840
understand that you can say okay we

470
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:40,580
realize that now looks but we'll go to

471
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:43,040
describe a little bit but then you're

472
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:45,080
not have it so if you actually think

473
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:49,580
that this data will be directly well you

474
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:51,560
can see people aquatica sorry go back to

475
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:53,510
your company isn't eligible to remove

476
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:56,060
from the public websites who they work

477
00:21:53,510 --> 00:22:10,190
with and you know record everything else

478
00:21:56,060 --> 00:22:13,820
inside of you so if you have on today

479
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:19,310
that yam and I think so far the only

480
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:25,220
thing we found this where'd you go to

481
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:28,389
find this infinite this is so like if

482
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:30,250
you want to make for some money filters

483
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:32,170
and that you have collected all this

484
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:36,520
information like like they take units

485
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:38,050
one example this is one of the projects

486
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:43,750
that was working with this month we

487
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:47,590
basically building in time after over 50

488
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:50,700
great bottle full Ares and other

489
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:50,699
homeless cover more about

490
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:01,990
all right thank you very much
