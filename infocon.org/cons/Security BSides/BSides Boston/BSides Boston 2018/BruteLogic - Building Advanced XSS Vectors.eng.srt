1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,410
our next presentation like I mentioned

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:07,319
this is going to be hopefully go well

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:09,780
he's actually in Brazil right now that's

4
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:11,820
why he's not here this is a friend of

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,649
mine who does a ton of great process

6
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,230
scripting research he works for a

7
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,090
security working on their web

8
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,529
application firewall is one of the

9
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:23,009
leading researchers this news you

10
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:26,250
probably have never seen on Louis calm

11
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:28,590
which is now they get some new name to

12
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:33,450
the site I guess which puts up process

13
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:35,250
scripting research research that's a

14
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,329
great place to go and if you're on

15
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,610
Twitter you want to learn more about

16
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:40,590
cross-site scripting this is a good one

17
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,660
of the people that you want to follow he

18
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,340
also has lots of other fun stuff that he

19
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,230
puts up as protected Twitter accounts

20
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,399
brutal secrets so he's going to talk

21
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:55,260
about itself a little bit at the

22
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:59,280
beginning and this is okay hi Pat hi

23
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:04,369
everyone good morning to all I would

24
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:10,170
like to introduce myself and I enemy who

25
00:01:04,369 --> 00:01:13,080
assists from Brazil and I will talk

26
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,619
about cross-site scripting and Vincent

27
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,509
Becker's

28
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:22,680
and I would like to ask to ask you in

29
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:26,640
advance to forgive my English because

30
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:32,939
the English is not my native language so

31
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:35,729
I hope you enjoyed the distort at least

32
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:42,000
the slides because it's an interesting

33
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:47,158
subject so here we go we start with

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:50,939
about about our channel we will go

35
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:56,250
through back to skim back to build up to

36
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:59,639
that I built web girl some ignores key

37
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:04,380
event handles the using native code

38
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:07,590
could bypass the the main subject of

39
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:12,380
this talk which are the location-based

40
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:18,440
payloads and we finish with

41
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:24,049
the reflection okay so I'm a security

42
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:28,820
research and security it's a huge which

43
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:32,990
is a security company the DOS my weekly

44
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:35,660
lab and protect the customs with a Web

45
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:41,390
Application Firewall my job is to break

46
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:44,900
it to bypass it to find the ways to in

47
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:46,459
which an attacker can harm and the

48
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:50,770
website of our customers

49
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:56,720
I'm a former number one at open but body

50
00:02:50,770 --> 00:03:00,020
for me access disposal and I have

51
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:03,380
somehow frames and appearing him somehow

52
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:09,530
James have some acknowledgement and as

53
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:10,820
you may know I'm specializing XSS you

54
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:14,260
may be thinking right now

55
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:17,900
Oh God and not that also next success

56
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:21,769
but I promise to you that this will be

57
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:27,730
kind of different of the things you see

58
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:31,610
out there and we will use the edit one

59
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:34,850
just for for the adductor compose

60
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:38,060
because in fact you must require a

61
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:42,019
better and proof of concept involving at

62
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:46,390
least and document dot domain to be sure

63
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:53,720
that the javascript is executing on the

64
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:57,140
victims page or on the target that that

65
00:03:53,720 --> 00:04:03,050
thought would be mean about the the

66
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:05,899
vectors involving HTML and events if it

67
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:09,770
handles because we have the class case

68
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:14,209
quickly Alex one we will talk about it

69
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:17,510
too but mainly the the HTML tags with an

70
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:20,450
avid Heather and some stuff may be hard

71
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:23,099
to follow because javascript is a very

72
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:26,490
weird language

73
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:30,290
and for those who are not used to it may

74
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:30,290
be a little bit difficult

75
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:41,520
dr. scheme we start with a scheme to

76
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:45,600
build the vectors we have the regular

77
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:49,289
one the simplest which is a tag and if

78
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:54,780
it handy and then the JavaScript code a

79
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:59,100
simple example would be who's sorry

80
00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:06,419
and it could be the SVG unload popping

81
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:11,610
Alex worn a very skinny a for one would

82
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:18,240
be like a spark we have the extra in

83
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:22,590
blue and the spaces in red what the

84
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:27,570
mandatory one is the first space this

85
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:33,380
has to be there the others are just as

86
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:33,380
extra so as an example we have the

87
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:41,609
payload effector with the head which

88
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:46,410
needs the table the tech table before so

89
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:51,150
we have zero C as a space a separator of

90
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:54,660
the one element or not we have the style

91
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:59,640
which makes the font size bigger to make

92
00:05:54,660 --> 00:06:04,220
it easier to almost open to trigger the

93
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:08,130
prompt box which is another just another

94
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:13,380
box like a harlot and config and we have

95
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:18,960
a bunch of ACE to to make is almost over

96
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:23,580
two trillion because with with with that

97
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:27,810
is in the page with the question were in

98
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:31,409
a bigger it's there are more chances to

99
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:34,169
the mouth and beyond it and trigger our

100
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:37,680
prompt boss

101
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:41,120
and later our to college web girl and

102
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:46,499
pretty logical dot dr suresh lab gun

103
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:50,639
which is me to build these vectors so

104
00:06:46,499 --> 00:06:54,180
it's not an automated - it's just more

105
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:58,680
interactive to cheat in the end of this

106
00:06:54,180 --> 00:07:04,020
talk will I will play with it live to

107
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:08,819
show you but I will show you some

108
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:12,990
screenshots it has more than 3000 unique

109
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:17,430
combinations just using the tag editor

110
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:21,629
handle the event handlers I'm not

111
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:24,840
counting the the JavaScript part the

112
00:07:21,629 --> 00:07:26,969
spaces the excel and all of this just

113
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,188
we've taken hand we have more than 3000

114
00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:32,300
and probably more because it needs some

115
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:37,830
improvement I did a lot of time ago and

116
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:42,750
I have to go back to it and update you

117
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:46,438
can you can use take your event to to

118
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:50,250
choose one of them and then the two will

119
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:54,710
bring the respective event to the attack

120
00:07:50,250 --> 00:08:00,120
or the respective tag to that effect and

121
00:07:54,710 --> 00:08:03,409
some we can we can choose handle by

122
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:06,659
browser you can choose handled by legacy

123
00:08:03,409 --> 00:08:10,639
for the filter bypass procedure that we

124
00:08:06,659 --> 00:08:13,759
will see in a little while we have the

125
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:18,449
rejection of the fact or manually and we

126
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:21,240
can test on a live target or just use

127
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:27,659
the default page the full test page of

128
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:31,349
the - here is the the main page where

129
00:08:27,659 --> 00:08:36,799
you can see the browsers we can see the

130
00:08:31,349 --> 00:08:40,159
fields that we can choose it brings with

131
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:46,019
t4 payload that's with your own art one

132
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:46,650
and after clicking on the beauty we took

133
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:49,680
the

134
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:53,250
vector appears on this text area below

135
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:59,069
and then we click on load to the next

136
00:08:53,250 --> 00:09:03,150
page which is the one we choose the the

137
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:06,900
time and some other options and click on

138
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:09,660
shoot and then if the payload is

139
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:12,810
correcting the page is vulnerable it

140
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:19,439
will pop up a knowledge of confirming or

141
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:23,849
prompt box so in order to to understand

142
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:26,480
what we will see we need to also know

143
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:32,460
about some eggnog ski event handlers

144
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:36,810
which if it helped us that can be used

145
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:37,680
with almost any tag they can work with a

146
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:41,339
betrayal tags

147
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:45,359
I mean tags that you can invent the name

148
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:52,400
like in bruge there is no type brooch on

149
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:56,100
html5 and but it is a XML and French 10

150
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:59,610
most required user interaction as we

151
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:04,260
will see and then I want your own major

152
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:07,230
browsers on blood on click on quality

153
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:10,230
and context menu from courage and drop

154
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:14,670
of kicking and so on okay

155
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:18,900
there are 18 event handlers like that

156
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:21,680
they are very useful and probably a good

157
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:25,350
filter will have to plot they know

158
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:29,339
simple example take blood or clinking

159
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:34,110
art world a click mystery a quick meet

160
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:39,839
text referring to in order to click in

161
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:42,420
pop-up that lets see now he using native

162
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,500
code because it's important to know

163
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:48,599
death too

164
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:51,650
and we have two examples the first the

165
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,250
first one is a very common scenario

166
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:57,420
where we

167
00:10:53,250 --> 00:11:01,680
have some input lengthen the value of

168
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:05,370
inputs tag of the type hidden' if the

169
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:09,569
code is all in the same line because it

170
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:14,130
was wrote on this way or because a

171
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:16,610
framework did in this way there are a

172
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:20,790
lot of sites that then make this stuff

173
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:24,390
so if you use the import scripture Alex

174
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:25,620
with the comments in the end we will see

175
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:29,640
like this

176
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:36,000
we have been ejected red and the

177
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:40,199
resulting blue the the not the negative

178
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:46,220
code is is being commented so the one

179
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:49,230
that that executes it so our at one box

180
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:52,080
the other example it's the same as

181
00:11:49,230 --> 00:12:00,080
before but now the code is different

182
00:11:52,080 --> 00:12:04,410
lines which makes us to adapt our vector

183
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:09,300
to fit on it and to execute I'm using a

184
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:12,930
my my Street and my website Bridge Road

185
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:17,250
cannot be our selection one it's just a

186
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:21,359
text file with Alec Alec one that will

187
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:24,330
be colored and executed by that by that

188
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:28,520
script or I can use in an extra text

189
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:34,530
mode form if the filter is looking for

190
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:39,300
some some alpha of alpha beta chars

191
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:45,180
after the double slash here we see the

192
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:51,719
injection read we use in the native

193
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:56,939
double quote and greet the inside and we

194
00:12:51,720 --> 00:13:00,480
see the resulting from also advanced pub

195
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:02,790
this adjuster and an intro to to want to

196
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,110
be single in a while but it's very

197
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:08,339
useful me

198
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:11,850
access of attacks in the white and even

199
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:19,110
does the unimportant you are bypassing

200
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:22,680
from as I posted on my clock but this is

201
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:24,720
to another tower ok filter bypass let's

202
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:28,349
see the basis of filter bypass because

203
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:35,180
there are tons of presentation about it

204
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:40,260
just we just review some we have the

205
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:44,279
procedural very useful and it was based

206
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:49,740
on this procedure that I beaut webcam we

207
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:54,660
have an arbitrary tag like X plus a fake

208
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:58,220
head like all X X X dot what and equals

209
00:13:54,660 --> 00:14:02,399
1 we simply start with five charts and

210
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:09,110
start to increase it so we have X you

211
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:13,560
know example 5 6 7 charts in total and

212
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:18,390
we see that in the seventh charge the

213
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:22,829
filter blockers so we can just use up to

214
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:24,300
6 shots so we have done caught on blown

215
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:29,160
on papi on Dragon

216
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:34,439
that's why when girl lists the headless

217
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:37,290
by group by homeless by the number of

218
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:40,620
Charles because it's important to tense

219
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:43,199
the filter of this way a filter kept

220
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:46,019
catch to take an abstract egg because

221
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:48,839
you can put anything on it so his his

222
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:52,170
last chance before the JavaScript part

223
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:55,079
it's the event handler so it's really

224
00:14:52,170 --> 00:15:01,170
important to to to know which headless

225
00:14:55,079 --> 00:15:05,550
it can cept we have the basic tricks

226
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:09,930
like encoding URL encoding we have mixed

227
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:14,449
case which it's still useful too

228
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:22,170
today Oh God still useful

229
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:26,310
we have dobry for very few tests and I

230
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:31,380
have spaces like we saw in webcam so

231
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:35,550
have slash we have Debbie new lining so

232
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:39,030
we have coats single quotes double

233
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:44,359
quotes we have cool thing that I call it

234
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:52,170
limited limit ism that we we make the

235
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:54,870
our testing our test probe to appeal

236
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:57,540
like something the future will allow to

237
00:15:54,870 --> 00:16:02,220
pass so we have is something that that

238
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:05,819
mimics the closing tag another word that

239
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:08,820
means a text outside the tag because the

240
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:12,260
tag was not very closing it's it's

241
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:16,200
between double quotes so it's parcel as

242
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:21,270
normal attribute of the tag and we have

243
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:26,420
something that feels like URL so we'll

244
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:31,439
have HTTP slash slash own clicky on blue

245
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:37,380
any event that we were so we have the

246
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:39,690
code that is the mix of our T's okay

247
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:40,680
enough let's start with the

248
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:46,470
location-based

249
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:52,790
payloads location-based payload is a

250
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:52,790
little complex very promise to tube you

251
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:59,570
and they are basically document dot

252
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:04,430
location properties of the JavaScript

253
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:05,510
language and similar stuff the the great

254
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:09,980
part of it

255
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:15,290
it's we can avoid special chars at least

256
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:17,689
between the equal and greater des which

257
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:21,438
is the JavaScript part of the vector

258
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:23,420
it's it's you can be sure that the game

259
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:27,380
you over to the filter because it's

260
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:30,530
almost impossible to to catch it a

261
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:36,170
filter better better to get it to catch

262
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:41,059
it before it so we have a scheme here of

263
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:44,750
the URL with the protocol domain path

264
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:47,770
page etc we start with the location

265
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:53,210
protocol which returns that that

266
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:54,620
protocol in red of our our scheme we

267
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:59,500
have location hostname or

268
00:17:54,620 --> 00:18:03,250
document.domain that returns the domain

269
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:07,640
location dot origin which returns the

270
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:10,610
protocol domain protocol close domain we

271
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:15,620
have the location of path name with path

272
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:18,550
and page location search which is all

273
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:24,379
after the special mark to the the hash

274
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:25,428
sign previous sibling dot not very dot

275
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:29,929
made not born

276
00:18:25,429 --> 00:18:36,350
dot text content I'll call it before as

277
00:18:29,929 --> 00:18:40,400
we will see in a little while why which

278
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:44,870
is the text one part right before the

279
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:49,760
dead tag name node name which we call

280
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:54,169
itself it's the name of the tag we are

281
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:58,010
using in the injection outer HTML which

282
00:18:54,170 --> 00:19:02,880
is the the whole thing the whole tag we

283
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:06,658
are using in an HTML

284
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:10,889
which we call after it's the text to

285
00:19:06,659 --> 00:19:13,980
read text content next sibling not not

286
00:19:10,889 --> 00:19:18,590
very for child not very less childhood

287
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:23,669
very they all are like before the text -

288
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:27,360
they are after the main tag but you sure

289
00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:32,460
- of course it's the hash part of the

290
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:38,279
URL and URL location which have base URL

291
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:44,519
I document URI it's the food where I out

292
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:49,679
you run out so we can also use it as we

293
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:54,590
will see in the following payloads so

294
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,590
let's let's start from the beginning -

295
00:19:54,860 --> 00:20:03,899
to get on we need to be taking that this

296
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:08,269
first the first balonus which you load

297
00:20:03,899 --> 00:20:14,039
location we came with location we can

298
00:20:08,269 --> 00:20:18,090
direct your browser a browser to to

299
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:20,908
another page but we can use the episode

300
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:24,809
of protocol JavaScript to make the

301
00:20:20,909 --> 00:20:31,679
browser execute our JavaScript code

302
00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:38,399
which is our h1 so after it we can start

303
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:44,480
to play and we come with the location

304
00:20:38,399 --> 00:20:47,939
hash substring 1 which will point to the

305
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:54,840
string the text the stuff that we have

306
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:59,659
after the rash the substring is 0

307
00:20:54,840 --> 00:21:05,039
it's the hash sign itself a substring 1

308
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:10,289
it's the JavaScript alert one next we

309
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:12,360
have we can split that stringy and to

310
00:21:10,289 --> 00:21:17,879
Javas + clip

311
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:21,659
sleepless Allen Prue's rt+ location has

312
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:26,370
to be sting one which we all go

313
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:31,049
Cantonese all of this with the hash part

314
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:34,080
which is the politest with the one

315
00:21:31,049 --> 00:21:36,450
palette this is a very important thing

316
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:40,350
to avoid because filters we will always

317
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:45,750
look for it that's what we are trying to

318
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:49,020
do here to avoid varieties so next we

319
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:56,309
have another trick to get rid of single

320
00:21:49,020 --> 00:22:00,030
post which is the the regex the street

321
00:21:56,309 --> 00:22:03,270
between in turn the slash slash Jarvis

322
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:07,440
slash dot source the dot source Prophet

323
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:10,980
returns the the rejects itself with no

324
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:16,710
change with no modifications and so we

325
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:20,400
can use it to avoid their coats next

326
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:24,210
line we have the Jarvis again we saw

327
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:28,140
scripting etc but using this time the

328
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:31,799
location hash with brackets bracket with

329
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:34,890
one and two because location hash is the

330
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:39,240
string another string here we can point

331
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:43,770
to positions on that on on that swing

332
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:48,120
it's an array like everything in

333
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:52,200
JavaScript so we have the left palette

334
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:54,659
is the number one right parameters and

335
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:57,120
the planets are are never said to

336
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:59,510
several anything after the hash has

337
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:03,570
never sent to serve it stays on client

338
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:07,290
so a filter will never see it but we are

339
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:12,059
still using practice so let's get rid of

340
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:16,950
them - lets see the they will show again

341
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:20,230
but for a new a new perspective let's

342
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:25,240
take the JavaScript text which is

343
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:29,380
method 1 and I'm 31 and we try to Alice

344
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:31,660
the tag name if we do that we will see

345
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:34,870
the JavaScript being being Alyx in the

346
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:39,340
page so we are tempted to try the

347
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:43,739
JavaScript column Alice one all in the

348
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:49,659
tag name it to point the location to it

349
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:52,809
but this will not work because the code

350
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:56,290
will be returning in uppercase and Alice

351
00:23:52,809 --> 00:24:03,760
can't be uppercase javascript cable not

352
00:23:56,290 --> 00:24:07,149
Alice so we have to to get rid of the

353
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:12,730
Dalits in the tag name in place it in

354
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:17,140
the hash part so we have the tag name

355
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:22,020
prawns location hash one which we work

356
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:24,640
in the tag name in an HTML location hash

357
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:28,389
which concatenates the tag name

358
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:32,350
javascript with in HTML which will turn

359
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:41,230
the click me part with the opening of

360
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:45,730
the Comets and in the hash part which

361
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:50,970
will close the comments and start our

362
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:50,970
party code our proof of concept pop

363
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:58,720
right below we see some constructions

364
00:24:54,809 --> 00:25:02,980
what we can do with such strings we see

365
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:06,820
javascript concatenating to click me to

366
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:10,679
run it in three ways three different

367
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:14,200
ways so we can play as we as we wish

368
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:14,940
with this to construct the JavaScript on

369
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:20,530
each one

370
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:24,700
the to execute our JavaScript code okay

371
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:25,418
let's go for a taxonomy now and we have

372
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,700
my type

373
00:25:25,419 --> 00:25:30,010
location location self location selfless

374
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:34,480
who helped by we have

375
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:37,480
positioning of these prophets we can use

376
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,730
that common names like before which

377
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:42,640
comes before the tag of course itself

378
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:46,210
the tech itself which has something

379
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:51,280
inside some attributes for example we

380
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:53,770
have after you have the hash part let's

381
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:58,059
let's see the first example a very

382
00:25:53,770 --> 00:26:02,410
simple one with the in HTML prophets we

383
00:25:58,059 --> 00:26:07,540
just have a Habitrail tag which it's the

384
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:11,400
j1 that with on click we can punch the

385
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:15,428
browser using location show that in HTML

386
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:19,510
string return which is the JavaScript

387
00:26:15,429 --> 00:26:23,830
colon at one and double slash to commit

388
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:26,820
the rest this will pop up the the arch

389
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:30,720
one flawless

390
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:38,168
another example would be location side

391
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:40,440
which is we are using the name NID to to

392
00:26:38,169 --> 00:26:45,309
construct the JavaScript our last string

393
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:51,809
we have Namie as javascript in red in

394
00:26:45,309 --> 00:26:57,280
the IDs t : a Letran who contain h both

395
00:26:51,809 --> 00:27:02,410
we have our location so things start to

396
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:06,610
get to get complex with the next one we

397
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:10,270
already saw which is the tag name in

398
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:14,860
HTML location hash we take the tag name

399
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:18,280
it it takes after the tag which is the

400
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:21,850
inner HTML and take the hash we start

401
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:24,639
with start a comet and close the call

402
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:28,990
because again we have to get rid of the

403
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:32,530
hash sign which will not be a valid

404
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:34,080
syntax so we have to calm it oh we can

405
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:39,158
stringify

406
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:42,090
sweet fight between foods swing by the

407
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:47,309
the hash to 2

408
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:50,100
be sure to use the arts which is the the

409
00:27:47,309 --> 00:27:55,350
next example the next line we are using

410
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:58,649
single quotes to to turn click me and

411
00:27:55,350 --> 00:28:02,010
the hash sign into a string and then

412
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:04,890
well almost concatenated to allit world

413
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:09,500
because the middle sign is not really

414
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:17,460
concatenation but but it makes the

415
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:21,929
JavaScript parser executed so we have

416
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:24,960
our last example we are using URL which

417
00:28:21,929 --> 00:28:27,600
a little bit more complicated we start

418
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:31,679
tag names of spirit with job to the

419
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:35,490
inner HTML and then we use all the URL

420
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:39,690
which are injecting a reflector of

421
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:44,820
course and in fact the case which gives

422
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:48,659
us the resulting improve the the URL

423
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:52,860
will repeat the double quote which will

424
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:58,020
close the the first code the first

425
00:28:52,860 --> 00:29:03,149
double quote and then we'll stop will

426
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:06,658
try to choose to me knows the the next

427
00:29:03,149 --> 00:29:11,189
string which we start with the single

428
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:15,049
point click meet JavaScript hash will

429
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:19,559
close it in the hash and then again

430
00:29:15,049 --> 00:29:22,260
Minho's allit one I hope you are getting

431
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:26,309
because it's really hard to explain and

432
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:30,559
I have to talk coughs in English so hope

433
00:29:26,309 --> 00:29:34,200
you like then I hope you understand so

434
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:40,340
location itself Pradesh I'm use that

435
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:45,299
name and you URL in the red JavaScript I

436
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:47,299
have the order of the pillow the all the

437
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:50,929
vector including

438
00:29:47,299 --> 00:29:55,279
Italian children show that we are I'm

439
00:29:50,929 --> 00:29:58,129
using a URL as the same as before the

440
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:59,659
same McKinney's and but the next one is

441
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:05,360
a little different because I'm using

442
00:29:59,659 --> 00:30:07,100
what I call a blood job in blue we can

443
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:14,119
we can follow it

444
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:18,259
I've used HTTP and call as a label is

445
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:20,600
the JavaScript label it's it's a it's a

446
00:30:18,259 --> 00:30:25,609
piece of code we can name it you can

447
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:30,799
label so I'm using it in comment on the

448
00:30:25,609 --> 00:30:34,580
code until the end of the URL and to the

449
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:37,850
the hash when it comes to the hash I'm

450
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:40,489
using a newline character to jump to

451
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:44,238
another line and then make the

452
00:30:40,489 --> 00:30:50,239
JavaScript engine execute all at one so

453
00:30:44,239 --> 00:30:55,749
none of the URL will be a parcel it will

454
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:55,749
be considered to execute and just at one

455
00:30:57,609 --> 00:31:05,418
we have another example with location

456
00:31:01,899 --> 00:31:09,768
location after hash key after precession

457
00:31:05,419 --> 00:31:12,109
which the state mechanics before use the

458
00:31:09,769 --> 00:31:14,450
strings to concatenate to alt one and

459
00:31:12,109 --> 00:31:21,590
then using the new line the label adjure

460
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:28,539
again to achieve our our execution this

461
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:32,658
seems a little simple so we can move on

462
00:31:28,539 --> 00:31:36,590
the tissue itself has a process after

463
00:31:32,659 --> 00:31:43,460
pradesh we have the tag name with Java's

464
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:48,759
alone and the crypt part after the day

465
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:53,929
which is the inner HTML again the URL to

466
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:58,090
to concatenation closed the single

467
00:31:53,929 --> 00:32:00,140
quotes and double quotes that we open

468
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:02,899
again

469
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:09,100
the next slide the label ajob same

470
00:32:02,899 --> 00:32:09,100
treats use the the newline character

471
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:16,909
this this is more interesting because we

472
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:20,510
are using itself plus before which is

473
00:32:16,909 --> 00:32:23,059
the technique of speed plus previous

474
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:26,390
sibling taught notepad

475
00:32:23,059 --> 00:32:30,320
it's a little bit larger but for a

476
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:33,169
future this is not important the

477
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:38,539
important is to bypass it the pre

478
00:32:33,169 --> 00:32:42,139
possibly not where we returned the the

479
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:49,100
part before the tag it's the double

480
00:32:42,139 --> 00:32:58,158
quote minims lx9 just a GG mistake it

481
00:32:49,100 --> 00:33:03,678
was to be to be one but I hope you you

482
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:07,279
got the point now right below we have

483
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:10,880
itself after before will chance the

484
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:11,690
Javas well whip to click me and then

485
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,409
jump again

486
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:22,010
so the previous sibling which is the

487
00:33:15,409 --> 00:33:26,720
alatna again the key shaft itself which

488
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:31,850
is the combination of in HTML and out

489
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:39,289
HTML which start with JavaScript quick

490
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:42,939
me and then they are testimonies all the

491
00:33:39,289 --> 00:33:47,779
pillow we have in blue the result of it

492
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:53,419
we have javascript column 1 the click me

493
00:33:47,779 --> 00:33:57,409
between comets plus elect one with less

494
00:33:53,419 --> 00:34:01,669
than site before which is one because

495
00:33:57,409 --> 00:34:05,389
the one will be will be evaluated with

496
00:34:01,669 --> 00:34:08,089
the grid with the last inside to the

497
00:34:05,389 --> 00:34:13,719
network and then we we are comment the

498
00:34:08,089 --> 00:34:17,960
rest with the HTML comment

499
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:33,219
Kamisha mark next we have another

500
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:41,260
example of it which is the J sorry guys

501
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:45,408
we have the JavaScript click me close

502
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:50,330
the outer HTML in another example we are

503
00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:54,080
closed the comments at the creating a PG

504
00:34:50,330 --> 00:35:01,670
3 and then minnows our h1 comments in

505
00:34:54,080 --> 00:35:06,620
the rest again we have now vocation

506
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:07,790
after before after itself it's a little

507
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:10,250
bit more complicated

508
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:13,640
let's up to the the blue part which is

509
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:21,850
the result JavaScript freaked me between

510
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:24,680
comments and then the the tag name and

511
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:28,040
in fact is the outer edge here but we

512
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:31,580
started the tag name they are a dime and

513
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:35,210
commit the rest this require a little

514
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:37,299
bit of attention to to really understand

515
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:44,900
what is going on here because it's a

516
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:48,260
it's a larger payload it's it's they are

517
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:53,750
help you to using a browser to test to

518
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:57,680
make the RS by poking up so I don't I

519
00:35:53,750 --> 00:36:01,430
don't really hope that we can understand

520
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:05,810
it just seen for awhile but these lines

521
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:10,540
will be online those who didn't

522
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:16,600
understand it ok can take it out to

523
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:21,920
choose total area so and we have some

524
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:24,680
time limits and let's jump to the they

525
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,840
are not a type of location payload which

526
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:28,660
is the self aside

527
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:32,620
this these are the these are very cool

528
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:37,950
because we are using the the pillow to

529
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:42,069
construct to counter the the same page

530
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:44,500
the same page we are injection to make

531
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:47,590
another request another request this

532
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:51,420
time with the payload we want so here we

533
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:54,520
are use a location to to return the item

534
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:56,650
what what we have in ID we have the

535
00:36:54,520 --> 00:37:01,270
pressure mark which will make the

536
00:36:56,650 --> 00:37:04,030
location search for the same page to say

537
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:08,140
the same cubed page because we are

538
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:11,410
started to to declare the parameters

539
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:14,350
that we want in that page so we use in

540
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:21,879
the parameter P as an example so we are

541
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:25,690
again turning to the browser to use to

542
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:30,940
use that piece that people remain the

543
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:34,780
with the very earth SVG oh no Alex one

544
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:37,420
with a blue side where we are on encoded

545
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:40,330
of course because it will turn into

546
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:45,220
space so in blue we can see the resume

547
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:48,580
it just the same URL with that with the

548
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:52,180
value of the parameter P change change

549
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:55,450
to what we want to execute this can

550
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:59,890
trick our filter because the future will

551
00:37:55,450 --> 00:38:03,189
will just look for for the stuff on the

552
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:06,879
fan beginning after of our injection

553
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:12,060
which is dressed with g IG part it may

554
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:14,800
be just just ignored the that second

555
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:21,580
that second payload we are injecting in

556
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:28,500
the inter destiny of the location we

557
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:33,058
have it again below use the using us

558
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:37,229
towards script source as we did before

559
00:38:33,059 --> 00:38:41,459
we can also use it with the property

560
00:38:37,229 --> 00:38:45,319
after the day we are using again on red

561
00:38:41,459 --> 00:38:51,239
and the question mark the peep parameter

562
00:38:45,319 --> 00:38:54,359
and but this time we can encode the the

563
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:59,099
payload the final payload because it

564
00:38:54,359 --> 00:39:02,119
just acts and this in this way we can

565
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:02,119
trick the field again

566
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:13,200
vacation self blows itself we start with

567
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:17,339
location selfless which is the similar

568
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:24,618
became soft before but with we are using

569
00:39:17,339 --> 00:39:24,619
this time the HPP and the laypeople HPP

570
00:39:25,609 --> 00:39:34,740
HTTP parameter pollution it's a

571
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:41,210
technique that we use another another a

572
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:46,529
clone of the parameter value which we

573
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:51,240
instead of other people out into URL in

574
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:55,500
language like like PHP the second

575
00:39:51,240 --> 00:40:01,078
parameter that will be evaluated so with

576
00:39:55,500 --> 00:40:06,539
if we just if you just using if you just

577
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:15,569
used to add it to the URL we are using

578
00:40:06,539 --> 00:40:18,240
location plus equal outer HTML we so we

579
00:40:15,569 --> 00:40:21,390
can recap points the URL to another

580
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:25,459
address and that address we will come

581
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:30,359
with another peep parameter after the

582
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:34,529
original one and this new parameter that

583
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:40,410
will be executed that will be evaluated

584
00:40:34,529 --> 00:40:45,470
and execute our our JavaScript below we

585
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:50,910
have again with with it after captured

586
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:54,589
the pillow again in blue we have the

587
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:58,520
result which opens did you know that one

588
00:40:54,589 --> 00:41:04,200
completely encoded we have it before

589
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:08,339
same same stuff which cannot be used to

590
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:11,640
trick the server the design use document

591
00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:15,720
body text content which is all the the

592
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:19,770
text document body has but we

593
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:23,520
we are here think that we are injected

594
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:30,000
into the body so what comes before can

595
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:36,780
be used with our payload to to put in

596
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:40,830
the final result now Cho to finish this

597
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:43,380
top let's see something more more easy

598
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:46,590
which is the much reflection which

599
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:49,980
reflection is is very common in the

600
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:55,860
world usually the pages are vulnerable

601
00:41:49,980 --> 00:42:00,990
to more than one appearance of XSS in

602
00:41:55,860 --> 00:42:05,030
the page and then and then we have

603
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:11,790
double reflection with a single put read

604
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:15,270
the result in blue the cold in light

605
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:19,500
brain which we would not be executed

606
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:21,960
because it's according to the HTML

607
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:27,210
parser will be the value of the one

608
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:31,320
attribute we can see this again double

609
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:35,310
reflection with a single pute to the

610
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:38,850
script using script the same

611
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:42,740
construction using but now just I'm

612
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:47,130
using the single port and comments which

613
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:48,990
which can be used in the script tags we

614
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:52,520
have triple reflection we're using a

615
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:57,950
single input which is a little bit

616
00:42:52,520 --> 00:43:03,210
complicated but it still works if we

617
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:08,549
look at off to to find such a native

618
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:13,500
code that can that can provide such

619
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:17,660
scenario we have triple reflection which

620
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:21,380
thing we put user scripts also which is

621
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:25,310
which is also difficult to achieve

622
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:29,720
because we really need to rely on the

623
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:33,820
difficult to to be able to to open and

624
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:38,060
close the single pole double quotes etc

625
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:40,700
and this is the easiest one which is the

626
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:48,350
Moochie pooch when we have two inputs

627
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:53,770
like P n q2 to reflect on the page it's

628
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:57,200
very easy to inputs it's also easy so

629
00:43:53,770 --> 00:44:02,150
conclude the x-axis vectors can be

630
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:04,870
complex can easily be pewters he can

631
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:04,870
blow your mind

632
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:15,259
yeah and thanks thank you all and if you

633
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:18,710
have some questions please be kind

634
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:23,300
enough because I may not understand it

635
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:27,980
well the spoke in English but petit is

636
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:28,700
there to help me so thank you for this

637
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:38,270
opportunity

638
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:44,720
Thanks anybody have any questions for

639
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:46,460
him other than wow that was hard but

640
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,240
like I mentioned if you want to talk to

641
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:49,010
him directly

642

yeah yeah thank you guys think we have

647
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:04,390
one question for you okay

648
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:15,520
those three thousand unique attacks that

649
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:17,680
you have in your web gun can that be

650
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:21,640
loaded into something like burp suite or

651
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:26,379
some other tool yeah if I share the

652
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:29,759
database yes I'm I'm working but the

653
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:33,970
promise it's that I'm working on a to

654
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:38,410
privately to my employer superly to test

655
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:42,009
the the wharf so I'm not sure yet if I

656
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:47,200
can't share the database with without

657
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:51,690
