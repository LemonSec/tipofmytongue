1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,710
I'm Jen Andre I'm the CEO of a company

2
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:07,350
called command which is a startup based

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:10,559
out of Cambridge here in Boston my

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:13,230
background is I would say it's an RD and

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:16,230
insecurities products um I'm also an

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:18,090
entrepreneur so before command I was

7
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,250
co-founder of a company called Brett sac

8
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,869
which does cloud-based security

9
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,869
monitoring which is also based out of

10
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:29,519
here in Boston before that I worked rd

11
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:33,000
at Mandaeans and for that I did several

12
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,739
roles at symantec that semantics MSSP I

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,270
started off working the song and then I

14
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:39,360
move more to like the product

15
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:41,070
engineering side so I have for better or

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,860
worse a background in security and

17
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:46,800
security products some of the other

18
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,809
stuff I do is I helped organize a local

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,968
Boston security meetup group here called

20
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:52,500
hack secure we're just getting started

21
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:55,260
but we're starting to hold monthly

22
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,090
meetups we do things like lightning

23
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,559
toxin so it's basically designed for

24
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,149
practitioners to come and talk about

25
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,230
what they're working on so I'm really

26
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:03,059
excited about some of the stuff we I'm

27
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:06,810
coming up we've organized the CTF over

28
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:11,880
at rapid7 um and we should have some fun

29
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:13,290
stuff happening there anyway so I

30
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,449
realized when I was writing this talk

31
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,700
not everyone knew what a Hydra was so I

32
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,140
figured I should put some slides here to

33
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,439
explain it and thank you for pointing

34
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,820
that out um so a Hydra for those of you

35
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:26,850
that don't know is a mythical creature

36
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:28,740
it's definitely not real but it's a

37
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,869
creature and the story of this creature

38
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,158
is if you cut off one of its heads to

39
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:34,110
will grow back so there's a whole

40
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,420
there's a whole myth all mythological

41
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:39,270
story about it but that's the essential

42
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:43,590
core point of it um and I wanted to talk

43
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:47,009
about how we security teams ah should

44
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:48,210
aspire to some of those traits so the

45
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:51,630
first train I want to talk about is

46
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:54,240
resiliency so um I like this picture

47
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,039
here because you see me all of you are

48
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,059
familiar with the pirate

49
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,470
a and the many attempts to shut off

50
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:03,530
while sharing our report sharing their

51
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:04,850
but I think resiliency is one key point

52
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:06,440
that we can we can take from this

53
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:09,199
mythological myth you cut off one of its

54
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:11,180
heads to girls back and we a security

55
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:14,600
team should aspire to that short of

56
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:16,760
resiliency scalability is another thing

57
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,620
obviously having multiple heads is a

58
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,120
useful thing the guy this picture here

59
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:23,660
looks like he's kind of struggling to

60
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,100
deal with what's going on here and um it

61
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:27,140
can kind of feel like this as a defender

62
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,459
but if you're if you're an attacker and

63
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:31,640
you have to avoid all these different

64
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:32,660
traps you can kind of turn the tables on

65
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,690
an attacker as well and I'm going to

66
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:41,959
talk about some of those use cases later

67
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:43,880
on so the key point about this is that

68
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:45,680
we want these traits across not just

69
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,820
like the systems that we're trying to

70
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,130
secure and the stuff we're trying to

71
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:51,170
secure but also in our security team as

72
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:53,150
well we should be resilient and we

73
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:54,380
should be scalable so as the

74
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:56,720
organization grows that we are

75
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:58,010
protecting we should also scale to that

76
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,320
organization we should be resilient to

77
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:02,600
changes within the environment we're

78
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:05,600
protecting and for most of us we have to

79
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:08,000
be just because we don't take a snapshot

80
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,190
of a company or a network at a certain

81
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,560
state and protect that we have to always

82
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:14,560
be thinking about the next big thing

83
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:20,439
so ways we fail at both of those things

84
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:22,359
we own the policy in the process around

85
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:24,999
things that don't help execute and I'll

86
00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:26,909
talk about more specific use cases but

87
00:03:24,999 --> 00:03:29,290
it's generally the philosophy that we

88
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:31,980
give out these policies or to find these

89
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:34,060
processes to these other organizations

90
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,858
several organizations and teams that

91
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,810
were working with and we say you need to

92
00:03:35,859 --> 00:03:39,459
be doing this versus you need to be

93
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:44,169
doing this and here's a way we can help

94
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:46,120
you get that done I think another way

95
00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:48,730
where security teams can fail is we

96
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:51,519
don't scale ourselves so if we are the

97
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:53,590
gating factor for security decisions if

98
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,840
we put a process in place or a policy in

99
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:57,730
place that says you know we need to have

100
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,439
some sort of uh you know but a

101
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:01,060
vulnerability management process but you

102
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,969
guys are you know we'd ever prove

103
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,530
everything or um at for any login that

104
00:04:03,969 --> 00:04:08,439
comes in or any access control we have

105
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:09,730
to approve the access control we become

106
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:14,530
the gating factor and it's hard to scale

107
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:16,149
ourselves and also if we hold all the

108
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:18,070
knowledge and expertise about security

109
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:19,839
and every time a decision has to be made

110
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:22,530
they have to come to us then I think we

111
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,530
also fail

112
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:28,280
so this concept of the human body net um

113
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:29,840
how many of you have been or seen a

114
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,900
security at scale conference how about

115
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,000
Facebook cool yeah there's one in Boston

116
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:37,190
recently and I like these conferences

117
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,760
because you just kind of see some

118
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:41,930
interesting ways these new technology

119
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:45,280
companies are solving problems in

120
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:48,080
security so this term actually came from

121
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,580
yoga Monica who I think he's at daughter

122
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,030
security now but back when he gave this

123
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:54,289
talk he was at square security and this

124
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:56,630
is actually a really good talk to watch

125
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:59,000
because he talks about some of the stuff

126
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:01,460
they did it square which is obviously a

127
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,670
payment processing company um you know a

128
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:07,789
technology company that he had to do in

129
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:09,890
order to protect that business and he

130
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:11,750
didn't have a huge security team he

131
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:13,159
didn't have a huge security budget so he

132
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:15,500
ended up having to do some really

133
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,330
innovative things and one concept he

134
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:21,380
introduces in this talk is the idea of

135
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:23,870
being a human botnet so rather than you

136
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:26,210
know security taking all of the tasks

137
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:29,000
that's pretty traditionally owns he

138
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:31,250
decided to introduce some processes and

139
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,170
some tools to start scaling that out to

140
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,880
the rest of the organization and that's

141
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:37,070
actually kind of the core of this talk

142
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,930
there's going to be some you know talk

143
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:40,550
of automation and different tools to

144
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:43,400
accomplish that but really the

145
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:46,610
philosophy is like how do we as security

146
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:50,919
team scale ourselves so we can be

147
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:50,920
resilient and we can be flexible

148
00:05:51,969 --> 00:05:58,929
so the first use case I want to talk

149
00:05:53,979 --> 00:06:01,808
about is around security monitoring so

150
00:05:58,929 --> 00:06:03,099
when you think about how security teams

151
00:06:01,809 --> 00:06:05,139
have traditionally done security

152
00:06:03,099 --> 00:06:08,289
monitoring you have all these different

153
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:09,249
tools and systems generating alarms

154
00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:12,159
they're looking at a bunch of different

155
00:06:09,249 --> 00:06:14,739
stuff the cool thing is is like there's

156
00:06:12,159 --> 00:06:16,808
there's actually more I think data

157
00:06:14,739 --> 00:06:17,828
collection and more technology today we

158
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:19,989
have all these new different types of

159
00:06:17,829 --> 00:06:22,119
cool endpoints that you all these

160
00:06:19,989 --> 00:06:26,649
interesting on collection and alerting

161
00:06:22,119 --> 00:06:27,909
of things and it's really great except

162
00:06:26,649 --> 00:06:29,439
that you need someone to actually

163
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:30,759
monitor these alerts you're gonna you're

164
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:34,360
going to do some level filtering things

165
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:35,860
out but um you know this is how I felt

166
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,289
like this is what private why I left the

167
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,429
stock because after you know six months

168
00:06:38,289 --> 00:06:40,808
of doing that wreak havoc I don't want

169
00:06:39,429 --> 00:06:42,849
to do with that triage ever get in my

170
00:06:40,809 --> 00:06:44,679
life I want to work on the systems that

171
00:06:42,849 --> 00:06:48,459
actually detect these threats and try to

172
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:51,458
improve that so what have I told you

173
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:53,559
that you didn't have to do this anymore

174
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:57,969
like this this wasn't the only way to do

175
00:06:53,559 --> 00:07:00,639
security monitoring so I don't know how

176
00:06:57,969 --> 00:07:04,149
many of you saw um I guess three or four

177
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,469
weeks ago Ryan Hoover was a straight

178
00:07:04,149 --> 00:07:06,969
edge here at slac close to this blog

179
00:07:05,469 --> 00:07:09,610
post and I thought was really

180
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:12,429
interesting and it very much ties into

181
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:15,729
this whole talking getting but it's all

182
00:07:12,429 --> 00:07:17,378
around how they the team at slac scaled

183
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:19,929
out their security monitoring they don't

184
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:21,610
have a huge you know sock with a bunch

185
00:07:19,929 --> 00:07:23,018
of security and us triaging all these

186
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:27,159
alerts what they did was very

187
00:07:23,019 --> 00:07:29,979
interesting so oh my i failed on

188
00:07:27,159 --> 00:07:31,989
animation but you get the point so the

189
00:07:29,979 --> 00:07:35,079
way the process works is they have

190
00:07:31,989 --> 00:07:36,339
monitoring on various servers and in

191
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:40,899
points that you security monitoring

192
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:43,299
right and what happens is that every

193
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:44,999
time there's an alert that happens the

194
00:07:43,299 --> 00:07:47,289
Lord doesn't immediately go to some

195
00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:49,629
security event manager that queue for

196
00:07:47,289 --> 00:07:53,019
security analyst to triage what they do

197
00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:56,679
instead for certain possible Ertz is

198
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:58,050
they actually determine who could

199
00:07:56,679 --> 00:08:00,539
potentially triage

200
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:03,180
alert so on this particular use case if

201
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:05,128
someone logs into a server right like an

202
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:08,370
application server and runs a command

203
00:08:05,129 --> 00:08:11,009
that slap being suspicious on what they

204
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:13,800
do is they look up who's the user that's

205
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:17,220
actually logged in at the time what's a

206
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,810
slack username and then they triage via

207
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:21,810
slack so what they'll do is they'll send

208
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:23,789
a direct message to that person and say

209
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:27,330
hey did you actually run this command

210
00:08:23,789 --> 00:08:28,919
that we saw was suspicious that person

211
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:31,409
can reply yes or no they can acknowledge

212
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:34,140
or not and then the acknowledgement

213
00:08:31,409 --> 00:08:36,088
itself is actually um confirmed to be a

214
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,740
two-factor system they have a kind of an

215
00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:38,849
app on their phone where someone has to

216
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:44,130
confirm that they actually knowledge

217
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:45,480
learn and that's cool and the cool thing

218
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:46,740
about it is like it's not really that

219
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,560
hard to implement when you think about

220
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,630
it so what about some of the pieces that

221
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,579
you need to actually accomplish this you

222
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:55,380
need the endpoint monitoring the cool

223
00:08:53,579 --> 00:08:56,760
thing is is there's a lot of open source

224
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,589
tools that actually accomplish this

225
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,240
stuff and by the way like in their

226
00:08:58,589 --> 00:09:02,279
particular use case they were doing some

227
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,959
very specific behavioral monitoring this

228
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:05,130
could also apply to application

229
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:06,899
wondering well there's no reason why you

230
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:08,790
couldn't scale those alerts or even

231
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:11,250
certain classes and network alerts to

232
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:15,079
you know more sophisticated members of

233
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:17,399
your operations and engineering teams um

234
00:09:15,079 --> 00:09:21,420
you need a means of determining user

235
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:22,950
identity ownership so again like if

236
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,750
you're using open source stuff you can

237
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:27,029
use a configuration management database

238
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:28,500
if you have some other internal system

239
00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:32,030
you need that as well you can use that

240
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:34,790
as well um you know

241
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:37,010
need to determine who read the first

242
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:38,300
factor notification capability so in

243
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:40,250
this particular example they're using

244
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:43,459
slack you could easily use hipchat

245
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:45,830
jabber IRC anything else to first get in

246
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:48,770
touch with the user and try to confirm

247
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:52,360
whether or not that security alarm was

248
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:55,400
something that needs to be investigated

249
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:57,980
and then you need that to factor

250
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:59,270
confirmation so an example they used I

251
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,680
think they had built an app if you

252
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:02,329
actually go and look about blog it's

253
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,550
like a custom app that they built it

254
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:07,250
does a post trip edification but again

255
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:09,260
like you could use twilio or something

256
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,340
else some other you maybe the email as

257
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:15,710
another two factor authentication

258
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:18,800
mechanism um so I just talked about that

259
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:20,090
and then then this is sometimes the

260
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,180
toughest part you need the technology to

261
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:24,770
glue it all together um to be honest

262
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:29,089
like this isn't actually that much code

263
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:31,699
to put together and in order to prove

264
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:34,690
that to you I'm gonna show you a demo so

265
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:36,650
pray to the demo gods this works

266
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:38,780
actually first before I do the demo let

267
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:41,630
me talk about the architecture that I

268
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:43,520
came up with to replicate this so you

269
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:45,050
see here like I have this example server

270
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,660
that I'm to set up using a vagrant

271
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:49,219
virtual machine I've installed system

272
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,650
dig foul Scott code because it's open

273
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:53,000
source and it's free you can tell I just

274
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,319
like it didn't take me weeks to write

275
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,400
this because this was released this week

276
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,960
I literally just launched it but like if

277
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,670
you want a more commercial solution like

278
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,290
actually the last copy at co-founded

279
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:06,050
threat sac has a very nice turnkey

280
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:07,339
solution and you know for what a support

281
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:10,699
there's other commercial solutions that

282
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:13,100
you can use again like it's not the the

283
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,690
actual monitoring system isn't that

284
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:17,540
important it's more about demonstrating

285
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:19,370
the process here and then I have a

286
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:21,589
little agent that I wrote that basically

287
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:23,450
looks for the alerts on that box and

288
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:25,610
then what it'll do is every time there's

289
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:27,440
an alert it will forward it to our

290
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:30,170
deputy bought server and what's that

291
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,540
server do it actually connects to slack

292
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:34,310
and it will do well before I even does

293
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:36,050
that it does certain things like it

294
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:39,920
looks up who does the user account

295
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:42,258
belong to so if it's jai andhra and just

296
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,689
logged in it's going to be me and

297
00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:47,569
got a look at my phone number and then

298
00:11:44,689 --> 00:11:49,639
it will try to notify me on slack I have

299
00:11:47,569 --> 00:11:51,319
to confirm that that behavior was me and

300
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:55,339
if I confirm it it's going to try to

301
00:11:51,319 --> 00:11:56,779
two-factor message me on to Leo so let's

302
00:11:55,339 --> 00:12:03,949
see if I can actually get this demo to

303
00:11:56,779 --> 00:12:06,529
work so some of the tools i'm using here

304
00:12:03,949 --> 00:12:08,809
just to go over it again these are all

305
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:10,129
free or open source or like open

306
00:12:08,809 --> 00:12:14,269
platforms there's nothing here that's

307
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:16,189
you know like customer at all ah this

308
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:20,660
tool here is just a tool that I had to

309
00:12:16,189 --> 00:12:22,279
use to mirror my messages it's super

310
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,839
sketchy so after this talk and probably

311
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:25,279
gonna delete it because it's like

312
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,799
connected to my android phone at all

313
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:33,769
these weird ways ah let's see if I can

314
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:36,319
make sure i'm logged in here cool those

315
00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:38,119
are all my text messages if anyone here

316
00:12:36,319 --> 00:12:39,259
is my phone number please don't text me

317
00:12:38,119 --> 00:12:43,269
cuz it will show up here in the

318
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:47,480
notifications I'm looking over you

319
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:48,919
commanders um oh and before i get

320
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,779
started to show us a little bit of some

321
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:52,279
of the other stuff here um this is

322
00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:54,410
actually the repo with the source code

323
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:55,910
again this is very much proof of concept

324
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:57,829
don't deploy this in a production

325
00:12:55,910 --> 00:13:01,868
environment it's going to require a lot

326
00:12:57,829 --> 00:13:01,868
more validation to actually use

327
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,930
um just to show a little bit about what

328
00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:09,449
I'm actually going to learn on I've

329
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:12,269
deployed the Cystic Falco tool with two

330
00:13:09,449 --> 00:13:14,639
rules one rule which is to detect what I

331
00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:16,649
call privilege escalation and all this

332
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:22,949
does actually let me just zoom in here

333
00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:24,569
so you can see this is that good so the

334
00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:28,109
privilege escalation rule will just look

335
00:13:24,569 --> 00:13:35,099
for people basically running on sudo so

336
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:36,870
if you look at a studio user whoops yeah

337
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:40,740
the user exact binders here corresponds

338
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:43,350
to a pseudo execution if I can find it

339
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:45,420
yep exactly so it's looking for anyone

340
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:49,259
running pseudo or su on this particular

341
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:50,910
machine and um if it's not the agent

342
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:52,529
self because I don't want to report on

343
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:54,149
my own alerts i'll create this endless

344
00:13:52,529 --> 00:13:56,069
loop of stuff that's really annoying to

345
00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:58,310
deal with probably more annoying for

346
00:13:56,069 --> 00:14:00,990
twilio slack than me but annoying and

347
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:03,508
then I want to look for anything this is

348
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:07,040
here just the system call exec CDE which

349
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:11,360
is a process starting off very simple um

350
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,360
right let's go down here

351
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:16,400
I can't actually zoom in here for some

352
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:18,229
reason but if you can see this here the

353
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:20,660
second alert I have is on network

354
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:22,160
activity and again this I think actually

355
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:24,589
just shipped with Falco and modified it

356
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,150
just a tiny bit to filter anything from

357
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:28,010
the agent itself because of that

358
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:31,640
infinite loop issue and all I'm looking

359
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:34,910
for is any inbound or outbound FPS

360
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:38,150
activity from the IP family that's not

361
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:40,100
the agent and um actually has a process

362
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:41,600
named sometimes them for some reason

363
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:47,360
some events come in without a process

364
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:49,790
name that's it so this is the system

365
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,200
tool if you're interested in it again I

366
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:52,760
will look at you were looking at other

367
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,440
tools there's other open source OS query

368
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:59,140
threats that's a very good turnkey

369
00:14:54,440 --> 00:15:02,090
commercial one it doesn't really matter

370
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:05,689
so for the second factory notification i

371
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:08,180
am using twilio twilio is just basically

372
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:10,790
an API for sending text messages and

373
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:13,130
creating voice messages um they have

374
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:15,170
like a nice little rest api and it's

375
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:20,090
very easy to use so i used it because i

376
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:25,099
have to do this demo very fast um what

377
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:28,700
I've created here is a slack slack group

378
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:30,440
i called it security bot demo and once i

379
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:33,230
start the service you'll see basically a

380
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,550
bot come up called deputy you'll see

381
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:37,310
here i also created a channel called

382
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:39,650
security so what happens if i don't

383
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:41,479
actually confirm the second factor

384
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:43,100
authentication or I say this whole you

385
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,770
know this thing happened but it wasn't

386
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:48,230
me is that the security alert will get

387
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:49,730
escalated by getting posted to the

388
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:51,740
security channel so the security team

389
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:53,600
can deal with it now again you probably

390
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:57,890
want a more robust process for actually

391
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:59,660
escalating security events alright so

392
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:02,630
now that that's done let's get started

393
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:07,310
with the demo again try not to message

394
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:09,650
me or at least keep it PG if you do so

395
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:13,599
um the first thing I'm going to do is

396
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:13,600
actually log into my vagrant server

397
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:25,910
credit a user J Andre to do so hopefully

398
00:16:19,069 --> 00:16:27,410
this will work cut off um oh so this

399
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:32,540
tool here is just I'm just running

400
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:36,860
basically a proxy so that my agent can

401
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:38,629
connect and post messages to HBS IP like

402
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:40,370
I just wanted to make it more consistent

403
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:43,459
for my demo environment that's not

404
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:48,110
required in a production architecture

405
00:16:43,459 --> 00:16:50,119
and here is my security BOTS and I'm

406
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:52,009
using docker basically to start it up so

407
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,079
that's what I'm doing right now going to

408
00:16:52,009 --> 00:16:55,730
start up my security BOTS and what it's

409
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,439
going to do it's going to create an ACP

410
00:16:55,730 --> 00:17:01,160
server it's going to listen for two

411
00:16:57,439 --> 00:17:02,899
posts so um alerts is where my agent is

412
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:05,809
going to be posting alerts to when it

413
00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:08,929
sees them and confirm is where the

414
00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:11,329
twilio call back api is going to post

415
00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:16,280
the confirmation after I've applied via

416
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:19,089
text message any questions so far now

417
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:21,500
pray to the devil God's this works so

418
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:23,030
first of all i'm going to pretend i just

419
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,640
logged in this box you know on the

420
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:26,839
system admin i'm going to do something

421
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,720
that's going to be triggered by our

422
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:31,158
security monitoring system and because i

423
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,289
have one of those privilege escalation

424
00:17:31,159 --> 00:17:39,320
lips configured it should this should

425
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:42,730
work actually let me just um ah so you

426
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:47,600
can see here that i got a message saying

427
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:50,030
a suspicious commanders r and so again

428
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,469
what happened here was the agent which

429
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:55,549
is constantly looking for message from

430
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:59,049
cystic valco got an alert and posted a

431
00:17:55,549 --> 00:18:02,960
message to my slot channel say hey ah

432
00:17:59,049 --> 00:18:06,379
you logged in and you ran sudo LS on

433
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:08,630
this particular box now my job here if

434
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:11,750
this is you know this is me i'm just

435
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:13,580
going to confirm yes i ran that and then

436
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:16,690
it says acknowledging and what it's

437
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:19,158
going to do is confirm via my phone and

438
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:24,830
because i don't pay for twilio i'm using

439
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:26,690
the demo or the trial account can be a

440
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:29,330
little bit slow but hopefully a message

441
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:31,780
will come through actually confirming in

442
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:31,780
a second

443
00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:42,249
and if not you can see previous examples

444
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:44,940
of me testing this service out come on

445
00:18:42,249 --> 00:18:44,940
twilio

446
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:53,059
oh yeah so it came in on my phone and

447
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:54,580
then i refreshed right what was coming

448
00:18:53,059 --> 00:18:57,860
in so you didn't see the notification

449
00:18:54,580 --> 00:19:00,830
but you did see the message um sudo LS

450
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:03,620
was ran on this box at this time now I

451
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:05,689
can confirm um that I actually ran it

452
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:08,270
but like just for the sake of this demo

453
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:09,800
I want to pretend that like hey like

454
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:13,190
someone had actually stolen my slack

455
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:15,139
credentials and um tried to basically

456
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:18,790
confirm the security alert happen for me

457
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:23,030
so I'm just going to hit no to reject

458
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:28,639
and then what you see is the escalation

459
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:30,200
process happening where this where we

460
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,030
see it actually in the security channel

461
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,770
now again like this probably isn't the

462
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:35,090
most for both rebuff escalation process

463
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:36,920
you're probably going to want this to go

464
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:38,899
when total an actual ticketing system or

465
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:42,110
event queue afford instant handler to

466
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:43,820
handle but you can see the benefits of

467
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:46,010
this is like I don't have to deal with

468
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:48,919
every single potential security alert

469
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:50,540
that comes in I can actually fan out or

470
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:53,150
crowdsource some of these security

471
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:54,590
alerts to more sophisticated members of

472
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:57,679
the engineering team and off steam and

473
00:19:54,590 --> 00:20:03,559
reduce the burden of alert triage on the

474
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:06,470
security team any questions give us a

475
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:09,020
thumbs up again all the source code is

476
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:10,520
up on github it's very much proof of

477
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,929
concept like some of the things like the

478
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,639
actual looking up my phone number is

479
00:20:11,929 --> 00:20:14,630
just hard coded to environment variables

480
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,100
you don't want to use this you want an

481
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:19,400
actual system where you're looking at

482
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:23,469
people's credentials and everything like

483
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:28,380
that so cool

484
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:28,380
now back to this talk

485
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:41,390
so that's just one example of how

486
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:44,210
through a combination of both technology

487
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:45,500
process and I think security culture

488
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:47,930
we'll talk about a little bit later on

489
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:50,240
we can actually start crowdsourcing some

490
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:53,000
of the tasks that were previously owned

491
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:56,750
by security to um you know other members

492
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:59,300
of the organization second use case and

493
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:00,800
this actually comes from the top that I

494
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:03,260
reps in the first part of the slide on

495
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:07,040
the human body is around authentication

496
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:10,700
and access control so we have this

497
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:12,139
problem like everyone you know every

498
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:14,690
company tries to have some sort of

499
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:16,730
single sign-on solution but it turns out

500
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:18,230
like that rarely ever works especially

501
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:20,030
now that we have all these different

502
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:22,220
services that you know teams like to

503
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:23,720
sign up for news and that makes the big

504
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:26,930
pain in the ass for the security team

505
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:28,460
when someone reads the company or even

506
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:31,490
switches teams like who actually has

507
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:32,960
access to what and if you see this image

508
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:35,300
on the right is actually from a friend

509
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:38,210
of mine this was a list of his

510
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:40,100
credentials that he had to have at his

511
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:42,620
company and i will say it was a security

512
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:43,909
company so even though yet even though

513
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:46,459
even seen it several single sign-on

514
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:48,440
solutions like the thing i like here is

515
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:50,210
like some other password that is SSO but

516
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,010
not you have all these different

517
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:56,080
passwords for things and like someone um

518
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:58,970
when someone leaves the company whoops

519
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,800
the usual process is you get you get

520
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:02,450
this checklist right and someone goes

521
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:04,669
through a disables on this access which

522
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:06,110
is not super scalable and if the

523
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:08,360
security team is a gating factor at all

524
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:09,800
that that's time taken away from you

525
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:14,719
guys to do other things that you

526
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:17,330
probably should be doing so let me get

527
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:20,390
the story again cool so that's

528
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:23,750
absolutely the wrong solution security

529
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:25,370
should not gate access control for

530
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:27,650
things although that is a solution i've

531
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:30,110
seen some teams actually try because i

532
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:31,760
want to be able to wear the compliance

533
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:33,530
auditor comes and say yeah here's who

534
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,210
have access to what you know when

535
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:36,240
someone leaves the company we have a

536
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:38,070
process in the sack

537
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,120
gets implemented and also like they

538
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:43,590
don't want to have potential flying

539
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:45,030
around in case they get stolen so the

540
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:47,639
next case study I want to talk about is

541
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:49,200
again from that talk it's from square

542
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:53,130
and I thought this is a really cool

543
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:55,740
solution um so what square did is they

544
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:59,660
built this portal called doorman and

545
00:22:55,740 --> 00:23:02,429
what doorman is is an app store of

546
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:03,780
access control so I have all the

547
00:23:02,429 --> 00:23:06,210
differences things that people would

548
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:09,210
need access to and what they do is if

549
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:11,190
you want access to like Amazon you go in

550
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:13,170
and you request access to Amazon and

551
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:14,429
instead of the notification going the

552
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:16,260
security who has to approve it it

553
00:23:14,429 --> 00:23:18,900
actually goes to the person's manager

554
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:20,629
because what they figured it was like

555
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:23,160
your manager was the best person the

556
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:24,809
person was best equipped to actually

557
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:29,370
answer should this person have access to

558
00:23:24,809 --> 00:23:31,110
it or not that said that brings up a

559
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:32,699
couple questions what happens if your

560
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:33,719
manager just approves everything like he

561
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:37,470
doesn't want to deal with a she's like

562
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:39,900
yes yes yes you know Bob ah who's

563
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:42,150
basically a administrative assistant has

564
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:43,170
to have access to everything and what

565
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:44,730
happens if people just abused the system

566
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:46,140
and you know get access to all the

567
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:48,120
things they don't need what happens when

568
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:50,240
people leave so one cool thing they

569
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:52,919
actually built in this system was

570
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:55,830
basically access exploration like

571
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:58,050
automatic access desperation so if you

572
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:59,370
they create an account for you on like

573
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:02,639
an application server or somewhere else

574
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:04,320
and you never use it what happens to

575
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,690
that account it will actually get

576
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,639
deleted over time so things aged out so

577
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:10,230
even if you know someone leaves the

578
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,420
company and they go through that

579
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:15,210
checklist I'm assuming this is Matthew

580
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:16,380
automates the provisioning but that's

581
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:18,059
how you still had a checklist and

582
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:20,280
someone forgot to remove you from an

583
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:23,428
account eventually it would still lose

584
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:24,600
access because you're no longer long

585
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:25,470
that you can't get into the VPN you

586
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,620
can't log into that one

587
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:31,140
the server so I thought that was a cool

588
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:33,780
concept again by using by crowdsourcing

589
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:34,890
the work to on the managers instead of

590
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:39,030
making the security team to gating

591
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:42,780
factor they actually are crowdsourcing

592
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:44,820
the work that to do so again this is all

593
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:46,289
cool stuff but there are some actual

594
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,970
challenge is to implementing this like

595
00:24:46,289 --> 00:24:49,559
you know not every organization can do

596
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:52,049
this and I wanted to point some of that

597
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:53,908
out so it's gonna be challenging

598
00:24:52,049 --> 00:24:56,700
diplomat if you have a highly siloed

599
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:58,200
culture where people you know a

600
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,669
responsible for their thing they don't

601
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,570
want to take any security task because

602
00:24:59,669 --> 00:25:03,059
you know they're good I'd say that's

603
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:05,820
securities job you need to have a very

604
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:07,799
collaborative culture where you all try

605
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:09,270
to solve problems together to be able to

606
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:11,010
accomplish this I think if you're

607
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:13,889
outsourcing your IT and operations it's

608
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:15,980
also going to be very hard because again

609
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:18,659
like there's a contact in place and

610
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:20,549
you're paying this person do this it's

611
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:22,080
going to be very hard for them to do

612
00:25:20,549 --> 00:25:25,080
additional work outside of the scope of

613
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,639
that contract if you don't have

614
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,960
development skills in your security team

615
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,970
this is also going to be challenging

616
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:32,340
because again a lot of the system relies

617
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:34,559
on some level of automation being able

618
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:36,780
to figure this stuff out and scripting

619
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:38,639
it and to be honest that's a hard thing

620
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:40,049
to hire for these days everyone wants to

621
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,260
have a dead on their screen 18 but not

622
00:25:40,049 --> 00:25:44,820
everyone can and again the final

623
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:46,500
challenges you don't have the technology

624
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:49,289
in place to do the things you want to

625
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:51,870
accomplish like security monitoring the

626
00:25:49,289 --> 00:25:53,669
Joe API access to the things you want to

627
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:54,870
instrument that stuff's that sucks

628
00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:59,220
challenging you can't really get around

629
00:25:54,870 --> 00:26:01,139
that very easily that's there are some

630
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:03,450
organizations where it can be successful

631
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:05,190
I think you have a strong operation

632
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:07,559
engineering shared culture if you're

633
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:09,270
doing DevOps where people are starting

634
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:10,289
that you were they take responsibility

635
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:11,639
for these things and there's a high

636
00:26:10,289 --> 00:26:13,049
level of communication you could you can

637
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,960
probably introduce this concept you

638
00:26:13,049 --> 00:26:17,668
succeed and same sort of thing good

639
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,200
cross functional relationships you have

640
00:26:17,669 --> 00:26:21,750
an assist or some sort of security

641
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,190
leadership that you know crosses

642
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:27,390
boundaries and it can be a champion for

643
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:29,610
you etc and your security team already

644
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:31,140
have some Deb capabilities or the

645
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:33,678
business is willing to dedicate you know

646
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:36,650
some programmers to a project like this

647
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:43,500
in the name of you know

648
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:45,600
security in conclusion security should

649
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:48,090
not be monkeys in my opinion we should

650
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,189
be the experts and we should think of

651
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:51,240
creative ways to reduce you know alert

652
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:54,030
fatigue for the security by

653
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:56,190
crowdsourcing these tasks where possible

654
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:58,710
instead of just providing a policy or

655
00:26:56,190 --> 00:27:02,190
guideline we should provide some level

656
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:04,650
of automation um to actually make it

657
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:10,380
easier for the business to adopt our

658
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:12,270
security policies and whoops we should

659
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:14,460
bring on experts what experts are needed

660
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:16,080
and that's what I really think you know

661
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,100
in the future the security team is going

662
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,649
to be we're going to be the experts

663
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:23,158
we're going to be that the knowledge but

664
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:24,419
our job is also to educate on the rest

665
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:26,190
of the organization it and you know

666
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:31,020
deputize them on specific security task

667
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:32,789
wherever we can and we should not be the

668
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:35,400
sole owner of security and the benefits

669
00:27:32,789 --> 00:27:37,280
of this is that you know bring it back

670
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:41,429
to the hugger thing it's hard to kill

671
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:43,070
you know if the whole security team goes

672
00:27:41,429 --> 00:27:45,330
on vacation or gets food poisoning

673
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:47,850
security monitoring and these cash

674
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:51,000
should not stop and that's what we want

675
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:53,629
to accomplish here thank you any

676
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,630
questions

677
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:01,359
so there is a paramount to chat up stuff

678
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:02,879
in there yes are there other like chat

679
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:05,379
apps applications that you think are

680
00:28:02,879 --> 00:28:07,359
more relevant to security than just kind

681
00:28:05,379 --> 00:28:08,769
of general like the security monitoring

682
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:12,158
use case yeah like you could definitely

683
00:28:08,769 --> 00:28:15,070
I saw someone beautiful on post where I

684
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:17,679
think they integrated with my signal

685
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:20,230
sciences laughs so you can actually I

686
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:22,149
think run scams or like few laughs

687
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:23,619
lobster do something but I'm like oh

688
00:28:22,149 --> 00:28:25,629
I've also seen someone else for someone

689
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:27,519
else like you could set a command to the

690
00:28:25,629 --> 00:28:29,859
bond and have it run at em up scan or

691
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:31,359
you know even have it go fetch logs so

692
00:28:29,859 --> 00:28:32,559
based off of a like a security alert

693
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:34,359
that comes in maybe I need more

694
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:35,769
information to determine hey that was me

695
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:37,960
or not maybe I was drinking or something

696
00:28:35,769 --> 00:28:40,539
I mean I needed the other logs just for

697
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,830
contacts so maybe you could have it you

698
00:28:40,539 --> 00:28:43,289
can send a command to the bot and have

699
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:46,239
it fetch other logs around the same time

700
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:47,529
so you can actually use the bottom more

701
00:28:46,239 --> 00:28:49,149
than just like a little bit initial

702
00:28:47,529 --> 00:28:50,980
notification you can actually use it as

703
00:28:49,149 --> 00:28:53,109
part of the incident handling and

704
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:55,769
investigation and even projecting part

705
00:28:53,109 --> 00:28:55,769
of response process

706
00:28:59,129 --> 00:29:02,490
think I'm early
