1
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,510
I think we're ready and I think that's a

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,370
great way to started thinking these

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:13,840
sites for allowing this talk and

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:17,770
understanding the importance of it

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:20,770
focus on our practitioners side of what

6
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:22,869
we do every day and generally that means

7
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:25,420
we leave out soft skills and we leave

8
00:00:22,869 --> 00:00:28,060
out the human stuff and so I really

9
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:29,890
applaud these sites for bringing

10
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:33,370
awareness to some other topics that

11
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:35,379
really do challenge us everyday and we

12
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:36,910
can all change together and that's why

13
00:00:35,379 --> 00:00:38,830
this group of lovely ladies came

14
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:42,010
together is that we want to raise

15
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:43,449
awareness raise awareness in different

16
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:46,360
types of careers that are out in cyber

17
00:00:43,449 --> 00:00:50,949
that aren't being a very very technical

18
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:53,649
and are so most of their arm and ask all

19
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:54,969
of you to help us solve a very difficult

20
00:00:53,649 --> 00:00:58,000
challenge that we have in the community

21
00:00:54,969 --> 00:00:59,980
right now or a short you know CICIG are

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,250
all over the place but anywhere from you

23
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:05,019
know 500 million positions we certainly

24
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,700
don't know exactly yeah we're all trying

25
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:09,399
to figure it out but we know it's a lot

26
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:11,289
and we know it's growing and if you

27
00:01:09,399 --> 00:01:12,640
listen to much of speech just now it's

28
00:01:11,289 --> 00:01:15,430
probably going to continue considering

29
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,369
the vendors are creating these

30
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:21,100
challenges but another story so we're

31
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:23,709
going to do the hearing now and that is

32
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:27,729
we've got 10% max

33
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:29,649
females in cyber and up at 10%

34
00:01:27,729 --> 00:01:38,560
there's about 2% in leadership so we

35
00:01:29,649 --> 00:01:40,869
represent the 2% in leadership and yet

36
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,910
we want more and we know that we can't

37
00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:45,459
just rely on our education system we

38
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:48,130
need to as community recognize that

39
00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:51,060
we're not marketing or selling positions

40
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:53,550
in cyber correctly we are selling

41
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,200
Media education and I'm strictly

42
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:59,800
definitely tactician 'el software

43
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:01,420
engineering network engineering and as

44
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,160
we all know now there's tons of

45
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,480
different roles so we're going to

46
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,399
introduce ourselves ready to share our

47
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,860
stories and our different career paths

48
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:11,440
and the different jobs that we've had so

49
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:13,720
we just them along the way and then our

50
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,670
15 minutes will probably be up so that's

51
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,890

67
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:57,459
a colonel Dustin sociology major I grew

68
00:02:55,239 --> 00:03:01,709
up in California I happened to stumble

69
00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:03,940
upon two stereo entrepreneurs who had a

70
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:07,030
staffing agency a small at the time

71
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:09,010

72
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:11,380
joined one from two million 89 million

73
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:13,540

75
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:19,209
10 over 13 years and they are the same

76
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:21,040
founders of racket 7 so I got the

77
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:23,230
opportunity to leave the technical

78
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,840
staffing business and be the first vice

79
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:27,880

00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:37,959
for anybody that knows what that means

85
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:40,630
the culture is spectacular some of you

86
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:43,810
might not have the best phone calls from

87
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:46,060
salespeople many many many times I will

88
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:47,769
tell you that you can consider that we

89
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,600

at seven million but we knew we had a

91
00:03:49,600 --> 00:04:00,400
good product we were paying I apologize

92
00:03:52,239 --> 00:04:02,170
we got too many calls however from there

93
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,030
I which becomes EEO of one of our other

94
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:07,329
companies profession software where

95
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:08,860
rapid7 was born from hostage a mongoose

96
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:11,140
was there and he's won the build next to

97
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,850
us that was one of our first offer

98
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,529
companies and I went to restarted new

99
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:17,978

101
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:23,349
from VP of CEO very very interesting

102
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:26,530
different world had a lot of fun however

103
00:04:23,349 --> 00:04:28,990
I really missed the cyberspace and I

104
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:31,869
decided that it was time to do one of my

105
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:33,580
own stories and so that's how I grow sin

106
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:35,410
was bread and Sanderson's scene on

107
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,270
staffing for cyber professionals that

108
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:38,770
put the two together we're also building

109
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,599
a solution because digital searchers

110
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:42,490
absolutely broken as ridiculous as how

111
00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:45,340
hard it is for you folks to find jobs is

112
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:47,110
terrible and sort of core building some

113
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,700
solutions to fix that I mean it's on a

114
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:52,450
phone based in Boston but we're national

115
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:54,099
and so I can tell you that you know

116
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:56,260
coming into this field getting to work

117

166
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:12,650
then got into a point that I want to

167
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:16,479
change I missed that technology that I

168
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:19,909
had in the past and mr. the kind of

169
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:23,449
heists that you had every day that new

170
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:26,719
things happen contributors were awesome

171
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:29,300
but this kind of slow industry and I

172
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:30,860
haven't said move to security you have

173
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,479
to do this change and I was like I don't

174
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,279
know I didn't learn software I don't

175
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,949
know anything about technology time

176
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:39,560
passed since I started this and you

177
00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:43,909
really really pushed me to do it and at

178
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:47,120
seven worked at the time as a product

179
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:49,819
manager product marketing manager and

180
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:53,089
then Evol they've moved and learn the

181
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:55,849
space and I want to tell you all and I

182
00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:59,650
want you to tell your kids it's

183
00:07:55,849 --> 00:08:02,779
something that anyone can learn it's not

184
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:05,419
necessarily something that is taught in

185
00:08:02,779 --> 00:08:08,120
school or you talked in certain classes

186
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:10,669
or classes but it's something that if

187
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,620
you're interested you can just go on and

188
00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:14,419
learn it you can teach yourself there's

189
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,969
so many ways and so many small people to

190
00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:20,448
teach you that really glad that in this

191
00:08:16,969 --> 00:08:23,449
move today whatever reason growing

192
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:25,550
startup it's amazing the journey of this

193
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:27,560
industry there is no better time to

194
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:30,189
enjoy in the industry than today the

195
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:33,260
opportunities are endless

196
00:08:30,189 --> 00:08:35,659
alright my name is sandy Kerry Ellie and

197
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:38,299
my journey into security started when I

198
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:40,578
was in college I was a math major in

199
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:42,919
undergrad and my main interest in math

200
00:08:40,578 --> 00:08:44,599
was number theory and the only real

201
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:47,000
practical application of never very was

202
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,649
probably fake so I became interested in

203
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,480
that and studied in a little bit and

204
00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:51,740
knew I wasn't going to be a compiler or

205
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,949
anything the thought was kind of cool

206
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:57,350
stuff and so coming out of college I

207
00:08:54,949 --> 00:09:00,979
found a job as a software engineer

208
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:03,200
at the end in their cyber tres group so

209
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:05,500
I was doing programming for things

210
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,270
related to PKI and I really enjoyed that

211
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:10,670
but I also found in retrospect you know

212
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:12,680
I had a very narrow sense of what

213
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:15,020
security was I was looking at crypto I

214
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,640
was looking PK I didn't really see or

215
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:19,370
how awareness of the world beyond that

216
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,370
until a friend of mine recruited me in

217
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:24,320
that state and I think that's exposure

218
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:26,570
to everything application security and

219
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,520
network security and policy and start to

220
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:30,650
see you know a broader world they're

221
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:33,590
starting consulting doing a lot around

222
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:35,180
that and after about four years decided

223
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:37,250
you know what being in a start-up is

224
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:38,780
really interesting and I want to

225
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:40,340
understand a little bit more about the

226
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,990
decision-making process and building

227
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:44,120
business so I'm going back to business

228
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:46,630
wall and in doing so I ended up stepping

229
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:49,550
away from security for I guess about

230
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:51,730
four years after that out of business

231
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:54,260
school I ended up doing sales for a

232
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:55,880
really sort of hard technology company

233
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,830
mechanical engineering for a little

234
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,510
while and then moved into product

235
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:01,700
management and what I found I'd liked

236
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:03,650
about product management was that hey

237
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:05,540
I've been an engineer I had been a

238
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:07,400
consultant I've done a little sales and

239
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:09,829
little marketing I knew people all those

240
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,939
languages and so product management

241
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:13,640
which requires you to be so

242
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:15,080
cross-functional really appeals me but

243
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:17,380
my first product management role again

244
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:20,660
wasn't in security and it wasn't until

245
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:22,040
2010 when an opportunity with our Saint

246
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:24,500
presented itself that I found myself

247
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:26,240
back in security and I realized how much

248
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,980
I missed it and I realized how

249
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,260
comfortable at Dalton how much I

250
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:32,450
like unity and how much I liked having

251
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:33,980
those conversations and being part of

252
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:37,430
those problems and part of all of that

253
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:38,960
stuff and it was just you know past five

254
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:40,459
and a half years or so it was really

255
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,470
great because I got exposure to

256
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:44,810
different technologies different parts

257
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:46,490
of the market more people in the

258
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:49,430
community and just had a really

259
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:51,830
phenomenal experience there and I ended

260
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:53,839
up leaving RSA earlier this year and I'm

261
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:56,570
now finding myself I'm like okay what am

262
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:59,150
I going to do now and I feel like it's

263
00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:01,220
such a different better spot than I was

264
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:02,990
before because I have so much more

265
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:05,960
breadth in terms of understanding the

266
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:07,730
different types of options I have that I

267
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,380
can look at a product management or I

268
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:11,300
can look at the products or carry a look

269
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:13,100
at marketing I look at something more

270
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,630
technical that I have a lot of options

271
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:17,210
and I choose the thing that's going to

272
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:19,040
be the right next step for me versus

273
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:22,330
feeling as to strain as I might have

274
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,329
when I first got into the industry

275
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:31,969
it's a-workin um my name is Eric Carle

276
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:34,400
enjoy stories little company so I'm I

277
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:37,310
grew up in a small Central Asian country

278
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:40,639
called fun.i high school

279
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:43,758
sixteen and I had two options to finance

280
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:46,819
the computer science and I chose

281
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:49,939
computer science it was fun

282
00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:52,670
I finished my degree and I was totally

283
00:11:49,939 --> 00:11:54,740
on I was twenty years old and I felt

284
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:58,519
like I need to get out of the country

285
00:11:54,740 --> 00:12:01,339
huge travel would do stuff so I started

286
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:07,850
buying this cautious and I'm gonna

287
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:12,620
scholarship to do masters yeah yep any

288
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:17,660
any any place outside my country so

289
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:21,829
fight I can't fix out my mother she's

290
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:26,209
like what but I didn't care so I had a

291
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:30,138
best friend she's done so we fight we go

292
00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:37,579
in and we went to New Delhi who masters

293
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:39,290
in English so that's but that was those

294
00:12:37,579 --> 00:12:50,199
three years we're spending yeah it was

295
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:53,449
the best time to spend and so after that

296
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:56,809
and then I had this urge if I wanted

297
00:12:53,449 --> 00:13:00,800
more travel more and do stuff and I

298
00:12:56,809 --> 00:13:04,730
applied for internship in DC with Olga

299
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:08,209
it's an international organization and I

300
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:12,920
got in and I come on top of my

301
00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:15,640
graduation here was DC the huge United

302
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:20,069
States of America I was like you know

303
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:23,319
and my internship was in IT department

304
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:26,079
insecurity searly group so that's how I

305
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:28,510
got introduced to security so I won't

306
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:31,329
with them for two and a half years I did

307
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:34,300
a lot of TLS of smartcards

308
00:13:31,329 --> 00:13:38,130
identity management and user version it

309
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:42,689
was all infrastructure security and then

310
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:51,519
so it was a program it was the win it

311
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:56,010
was a three year program so I started

312
00:13:51,519 --> 00:14:01,329
looking for a job and it was 2008 it was

313
00:13:56,010 --> 00:14:05,260
a long security and I was in security in

314
00:14:01,329 --> 00:14:08,800
DC every job I applied heating clearance

315
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:12,310
because it was all contract government

316
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:15,279
jobs and I was like oh my gosh and I

317
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:17,859
applied for a position in PMC

318
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:21,070
and it was an application during

319
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:24,940
application security I didn't know

320
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:40,449
anything so in my interview and I asked

321
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:43,120
after all those mystical injection EMC

322
00:14:40,449 --> 00:14:46,870
for eight years I started as a spirit

323
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:50,410
engineer inside the development

324
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:51,940
lifecycle a deformable response and four

325
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:54,780
years ago I forgot management roles

326
00:14:51,940 --> 00:15:10,830
managed it to do and that's what

327
00:14:54,780 --> 00:15:15,900
so yeah my journey with the floating

328
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:18,450
Hospital for Children my greatest degree

329
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:23,189
I had no intention or desire to get into

330
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:25,440
anything related to security and here's

331
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:26,940
my path so I went to business school in

332
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,320
Dallas I'm a graduate of Southern

333
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:32,520
Methodist University undergraduate in

334
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,640
management information systems out of

335
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:39,000
the business school and also have a

336
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:40,740
degree in a Bachelor of Arts studying

337
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,230
art history a lot of his narrative also

338
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:47,240
need art history in Madrid my intent was

339
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:50,370
to become an art broker or I saw

340
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:59,520
something very glamorous

341
00:15:50,370 --> 00:16:01,490
this is glamorous - my background is in

342
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:05,660
management consulting so I'm very

343
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:09,779
processed procedure policy or illegal or

344
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:13,610
business operations background than

345
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:15,720
per say always worked in IT space

346
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:18,029
started consulting her Burroughs

347
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:20,970
students which is Bertha rosboroughs old

348
00:16:18,029 --> 00:16:22,649
management consulting firm in some work

349
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:25,170
without services and then when they had

350
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:27,509
acquired tip a branch off and did some

351
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:30,769
comm consulting when that was the big

352
00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:30,769
and science deviance

353
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:37,800
so I think what really lends some

354
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:40,079
intelligence to my job is that I've

355
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,670
actually kind of seen the P&L it's work

356
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:44,339
at Texas Instruments I've seen we have

357
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:45,628
the silicon chips we made will stand all

358
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:48,720
the way to through the manufacturing

359
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:50,670
process saying throw paper saying for

360
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,720
you know recycled plastics I kind of

361
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:54,089
know a little bit about various

362
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,680
industries and cell phone industry and

363
00:16:54,089 --> 00:16:58,079
that it's really informed my work as a

364
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:00,089
security officer because the first thing

365
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,589
that I do is tend to map but the

366
00:17:00,089 --> 00:17:03,209
business value is for whatever

367
00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:05,309
investment we're making in the security

368
00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:07,980
space or why does that make a difference

369
00:17:05,309 --> 00:17:09,869
and it seems that that's really

370
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:11,849
resonating with the executive suite as

371
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:13,500
of late we all know that it's hard to

372
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:17,549
get budget when we're fighting with

373
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:21,030
another IT initiatives and so really

374
00:17:17,549 --> 00:17:22,770
mapping that value is this very town day

375
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:25,559
within the security space but very very

376
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:30,990
rewarding when it's when it comes to

377
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:33,570
fruition awesome such great stories of

378
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:36,000
caring whether you know were men or

379
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:38,039
women the interesting thing is that the

380
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,870
security space is growing so quickly and

381
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:41,700
it's so fast that there's all kinds of

382
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:43,530
jobs and I would encourage n what are

383
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:46,020
your male or female - if you have

384
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:48,090
interest in other roles to take them out

385
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:49,559
because at the end of the day there

386
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:51,090
aren't enough of us you're always going

387
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:52,799
to have a place to be even though you

388
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:54,418
know again when you search sometimes it

389
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:58,168
doesn't feel that way they have patience

390
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:59,460
it can pan out for sure so so clue you

391
00:17:58,169 --> 00:18:02,220
know everybody think that from these

392
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:04,620
initial stories how about we move into a

393
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:07,020
little bit more of the female so visit

394
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:08,879
shares stories that we have just from a

395
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:10,950
perspective of raising awareness we all

396
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,530
believe we wouldn't be sitting out there

397
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:23,190
if it weren't for men particularly white

398
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:25,860
men you're not evil at all we love you

399
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:28,950
and we need help right we need more

400
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:30,899
women in here and so my story you know

401
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:32,669
as you heard earlier I've worked 19

402
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:36,090
years for the same two men that brought

403
00:18:32,669 --> 00:18:38,820
me into the industry and powerful

404
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:41,699
cultures and definitely no sexism it was

405
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:43,408
all merit-based and absolutely wonderful

406
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,580
promotion structures based on

407
00:18:43,409 --> 00:18:46,860
performance and lots of different

408
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:50,010
companies we can you know move in and

409
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:52,620
out of and all of that being said there

410
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:54,330
was a situation that is an interesting

411
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:56,370
story to hear so that again not

412
00:18:54,330 --> 00:19:00,000
everything is so obvious in terms of

413
00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:01,260
what can be you know what can happen and

414
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,620
a woman can get lucky

415
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:07,620
let's say so I'm 12 years into my

416
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:09,840
15-year career and staffing and I am the

417
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:11,669
vice president there is no question on

418
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,939
that because its sales the numbers are

419
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:17,460
really easy to count and and also I'm at

420
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:20,340
a bar and the main founders of entering

421
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:23,010
me on the sales side of the money side

422
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:24,899
into private 7 I hear him pitching the

423
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:27,480
vice president of sales job to one of my

424
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:29,780
core peers and yes we occupied the same

425
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:32,040
title however the the track workers were

426
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:33,389
definitely different enough to suggest

427
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:37,409
that I should be having that

428
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:39,120
conversation and when I realized what

429
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,450
was going on I leaned over and said wait

430
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,459
a minute

431
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:43,380
are you pitching him a new job outside

432
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:46,110
of this company and I why aren't you

433
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:47,640
talking to me and he's in front of my

434
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:49,379
buddy who we grow the business with and

435
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,780
he said Peter you just got married

436
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:53,130
and you've now got two stepchildren I

437
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:56,790
didn't even think you'd be interested

438
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:59,070
and genuinely truthfully coming from

439
00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:02,520
care coming from love right I mean these

440
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:04,080
groomsmen 12 years at that point and I

441
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:07,050
said well John that's just not the case

442
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:10,290
and of course I got the job and you know

443
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:15,149
they go I was at that bar I don't miss

444
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:18,479
any bar moments however I was

445
00:20:15,149 --> 00:20:21,029
my out there was one other VP who was

446
00:20:18,479 --> 00:20:22,529
pitch the job that turned it down even

447
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:23,909
before the one that I heard that was

448
00:20:22,529 --> 00:20:26,429
getting the pension Center both both of

449
00:20:23,909 --> 00:20:28,830
them I'm sure wish they had done things

450
00:20:26,429 --> 00:20:29,669
differently that being said interesting

451
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:31,710
right

452
00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:33,749
not being malicious and that's really

453
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:35,669
something that I really want everybody

454
00:20:33,749 --> 00:20:37,739
to think about the most discrimination

455
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:39,479
isn't malicious it isn't so you know

456
00:20:37,739 --> 00:20:42,419
somebody gets out of bed every day and

457
00:20:39,479 --> 00:20:44,369
said oh you mean there are those people

458
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:48,210
but we're slowly meeting the announcer

459
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:49,499
in this industry and yet you know we

460
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:51,659
need to be aware we need to think

461
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:54,359
outside of our own experiences and

462
00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:55,710
that's a great story I like to share in

463
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:58,289
the company

464
00:20:55,710 --> 00:21:00,509
wonderful they invested it was part of

465
00:20:58,289 --> 00:21:02,908
the beginning I mean you know or the CEO

466
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:05,609
says that when he started the company

467
00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:07,769
they were just as free co-founder it was

468
00:21:05,609 --> 00:21:10,408
clear to them that they person he needs

469
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:11,999
to be thought of as a day one and they

470
00:21:10,409 --> 00:21:14,759
need to bring it because if it's an

471
00:21:11,999 --> 00:21:17,999
afterthought later let's make these more

472
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:20,489
diverse doesn't slow that doesn't

473
00:21:17,999 --> 00:21:22,710
feature account making part of the DNA

474
00:21:20,489 --> 00:21:25,339
it has to be part of a DNA when we

475
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:28,559
started company he always talks about

476
00:21:25,339 --> 00:21:31,080
his name of being on the offense and

477
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:33,710
understanding that offensive teams are

478
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:37,918
very diverse that's the interesting part

479
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:40,259
they're the best in nature because you

480
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,269
need different perspective in bringing

481
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:43,859
to the room different people from

482
00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:47,009
different backgrounds not necessarily

483
00:21:43,859 --> 00:21:49,619
the gender diversity there is diversity

484
00:21:47,009 --> 00:21:51,899
there are not just corners the people

485
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:54,359
from different if you need to hack into

486
00:21:51,899 --> 00:21:56,639
a bag obviously you will bring the

487
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:58,199
address but you wouldn't also bring the

488
00:21:56,639 --> 00:21:59,459
guys that know a little bit about fine

489
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,620
but what

490
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:05,039
that knows the procedures obviously

491
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:07,500
there is gender diversity as well as

492
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:09,990
different kinds of diversity and I think

493
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:12,960
that we don't understand it that much

494
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:14,820
while the guys on the often size in all

495
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:18,289
the time it's really important I think

496
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:21,450
that we all as a community kind of

497
00:22:18,289 --> 00:22:23,549
embrace it eternal is in benefit at the

498
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:28,140
end of the day we are fighting something

499
00:22:23,549 --> 00:22:28,649
that has the university as part of it

500
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:32,370
evening

501
00:22:28,649 --> 00:22:34,350
that's interesting I mean we only know

502
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:36,689
our own experiences right we know what

503
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:38,580
we know and we need others around us and

504
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:41,730
have other experiences so that we can

505
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:47,129
know more and take on our adversaries

506
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:49,649
and a more holistic approach yeah so I

507
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:51,480
learned a really good lesson a few years

508
00:22:49,649 --> 00:22:53,549
ago I was at a Women's Conference and

509
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:56,070
there was a speaker there and I'll tell

510
00:22:53,549 --> 00:22:58,110
you where she was afterwards but she was

511
00:22:56,070 --> 00:23:02,029
talking about the different approach

512
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:04,229
that the lemon and mint and on her staff

513
00:23:02,029 --> 00:23:05,210
responded when she offered them

514
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:06,919
promotions

515
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:08,389
she said that a lot of time when she

516
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:10,309
offered promotions to the women on her

517
00:23:08,389 --> 00:23:12,709
staff the first thing out of their mouth

518
00:23:10,309 --> 00:23:14,119
was do you really think I can do it to

519
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:16,279
which her intern a lot a lot of the same

520
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:19,189
well yeah that's why I offered you the

521
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:22,820
promotion whereas men on her staff would

522
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:24,849
often say hell yeah it's about time and

523
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:28,309
she you know called that I was a very

524
00:23:24,849 --> 00:23:30,049
strong difference now a few weeks later

525
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:32,570
I was offered a really significant

526
00:23:30,049 --> 00:23:34,190
promotion at work and the interval

527
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:36,769
monologue in the back of my head was

528
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:39,919
gone oh my god holy crap can I do this

529
00:23:36,769 --> 00:23:42,049
but having heard that a few weeks ago I

530
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,690
thought to myself yeah well I'm gonna

531
00:23:42,049 --> 00:23:46,099
project that I just said absolutely hell

532
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:49,159
yeah I could do that I want to do that

533
00:23:46,099 --> 00:23:50,689
about time and it really impacted me in

534
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:53,539
terms of how I approached it how I

535
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:55,969
presented myself that I was not going to

536
00:23:53,539 --> 00:23:58,460
be tentative I'll go to a pier freaked

537
00:23:55,969 --> 00:24:00,379
out even if I was freaked out and really

538
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:02,899
just you know make sure that they knew

539
00:24:00,379 --> 00:24:05,570
that I valued myself enough and expected

540
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:07,279
this not believe that I can do it and

541
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:12,589
the person who gave this advice it's now

542
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:14,450
ready for combat myself time research

543
00:24:12,589 --> 00:24:17,499
that says that women do not go after

544
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:22,519
promotions women do not go after raises

545
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:25,159
were trained to not take the risk really

546
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:26,869
and put ourselves out there so again

547
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:29,599
another thing that you can help the

548
00:24:26,869 --> 00:24:31,339
women in your life help teach them give

549
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:33,200
them I think stories if you hadn't heard

550
00:24:31,339 --> 00:24:34,999
that story who knows what your

551
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,440
responsibilities interesting it is

552
00:24:34,999 --> 00:24:38,719
really nice that it was there anyone

553
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:41,029
sitting right in my mind when I'm having

554
00:24:38,719 --> 00:24:44,929
the conversation with them I think I was

555
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:47,169
talking to the CTL and just okay I can

556
00:24:44,929 --> 00:24:47,169
do this

557
00:24:50,780 --> 00:25:06,290
as you were telling that story just very

558
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:08,120
very high and very common mmm and one of

559
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:11,120
these is interesting is I think that a

560
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:13,040
lot of the guys that I work with they

561
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,260
have that same information internally I

562
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:17,659
mean it's the standard representation of

563
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:20,260
the posture syndrome fortunately I'm not

564
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:20,260
this smart

565
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:49,640
the impostor syndrome is is the same in

566
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:54,470
both of these yeah yeah I'm wondering on

567
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:56,540
the mound trees and fall growing off

568
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:59,630
like why it was for you guys that why do

569
00:25:56,540 --> 00:26:02,870
you think of that yeah there's a really

570
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:06,110
great talk about that you know teaching

571
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:09,020
our daughters to be brave thank you

572
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:11,669
it's okay you know you know why we teach

573
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:14,400
our sons to be brave

574
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:16,800
and I'm teaching our story right that's

575
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,600
I mean it's I hope thing talk so

576
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,840
successful women though in adulthood

577
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:23,280
like how did you learn at so for like my

578
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:25,260
sister-in-law is just starting to try it

579
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:28,560
into the computer science world like how

580
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:30,930
do you start to alter that mentality in

581
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:32,669
adults for young we lucked out and

582
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:34,080
that's the problem meaning somebody said

583
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:36,650
something right you were doing at least

584
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:39,149
for me I feel I left out it feel like I

585
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:40,920
got chance to work for two men that

586
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:43,530
we're always saying I couldn't do it as

587
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:44,730
soon as I heard that I was doing it but

588
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:46,020
you see my experience is totally

589
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:48,240
different yes I didn't get that

590
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:50,190
affirmation along my career what I

591
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,230
really made a point of doing is

592
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:54,270
observing what was happening in the room

593
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:56,250
or the circumstances that were me I

594
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:57,930
think that in this world of technology

595
00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:01,950
our social skills are in a little bit of

596
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:05,760
a peril because the skills that you

597
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:08,130
learn to me and in business at the time

598
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:10,590
were in a reading room understanding

599
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:11,550
people's needs understanding that what

600
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:14,159
they wanted to get out of the

601
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:15,409
conversation or the deal or whatever was

602
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,900
in front

603
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:20,720
business perspective and I think you

604
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:22,310
know it's a female I always I never

605
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,810
occurred to me to look for affirmation

606
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:25,520
from other so I was really looking at my

607
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:28,700
peer group and they may have been

608
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:30,980
predominantly a very very smart man but

609
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:32,960
just being beard very real about my

610
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:34,850
talents in line with the other people

611
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,700
that I was sort of swimming with the

612
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:39,379
time and and just accepting so I think

613
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:41,900
it's something that happens internally I

614
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:44,660
think that you know if we build some

615
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:48,950
sort of structure that's gonna you know

616
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:50,990
obligate society to you know Dean woman

617
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:52,450
more of the argument or the entity we're

618
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:58,370
gonna be setting ourselves up for

619
00:27:52,450 --> 00:28:00,230
something that's not too stable I'm

620
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:02,800
reminded of being 10 years old and

621
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:05,600
visiting the Boston Science Museum and

622
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:07,879
there was some quiz that was going on

623
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,949
about are you tense in mathematics now I

624
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:12,080
love math or growing up and I had no

625
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:13,490
fear about about so ever but the entire

626
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,290
point of it in all the language around

627
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:17,540
it is but women are often tense in

628
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:19,550
mathematics and this was the first time

629
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:21,740
that I never heard about test as a

630
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:25,460
ten-year-old from an external source at

631
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:28,850
the buff doing science museum and it was

632
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:30,110
I mean you know and so that started to

633
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:32,000
be something that I was aware of that

634
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:33,949
people talked about and I kinda known

635
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,440
until then that people did and then

636
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:37,550
actually I think it was true until a few

637
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,740
years ago if you went into the

638
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:41,659
Mathematica exhibit at the Boston

639
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:44,060
Science Museum when it had the whole

640
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:47,660
timeline of mathematicians the title

641
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:53,600
said men of modern that matters

642
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:55,010
yeah conditioning yes I think what

643
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,010
you're saying it's completely right

644
00:28:55,010 --> 00:29:00,560
which is once you get to the point where

645
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:02,360
you're you always have to as an adult

646
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:05,080
measure yourself against your own

647
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:08,179
self-portrait and find it within right

648
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:10,370
where but then I also think about Sandy

649
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:13,370
story and that you know how do we then

650
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:16,449
encourage not so how do we encourage

651
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:20,239
girls are we young age to be able to

652
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:23,510
take more risks to sail faster be more

653
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,830
perseverant when they reach obstacles

654
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:29,120
and the doctors some really interesting

655
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:32,120
data on that the one of the women

656
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:34,100
conference last year had run a bunch of

657
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:37,549
studies and basically that sports are

658
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:41,149
one key ways that that we can help young

659
00:29:37,549 --> 00:29:43,668
girls develop into their self-confidence

660
00:29:41,149 --> 00:29:46,399
their self-esteem their resiliency all

661
00:29:43,669 --> 00:29:48,799
the things that we need in order to put

662
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:50,850
ourselves for that promotion because

663
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:54,030
those

664
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:57,469
but a fireman lure them to try so lots

665
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:57,470
of things we also need to be

666
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:01,900
to encourage them to develop the skills

667
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:04,090
that he wants of a web name and get

668
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:06,730
older at that point if they recognize

669
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:08,260
that Novus team I think it's get might I

670
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:09,520
think it's the same thing that happens

671
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,720
when you've reached a level in your

672
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,820
career by us when I was talking

673
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,170
yesterday he said you know you reach a

674
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:19,510
certain level and you look around you're

675
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:21,130
like I knew anything about mentors but

676
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:23,290
this level right at this layer so you

677
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:24,910
have to find grow finding yourself and

678
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:26,530
find people that inspire you differently

679
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:40,390
the nerve you know the career chard

680
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:41,740
mentor maybe somebody that rocky let's

681
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:44,170
tease everybody to be brave and

682
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:46,600
confident and secure if that means

683
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:48,910
climbing a tree and falling then let the

684
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,629
girls climb the trees - right whatever

685
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:53,110
that means

686
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:54,790
or that she translates into it does have

687
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:56,740
a difference and let's not dress them

688
00:30:54,790 --> 00:31:00,250
with juicy on their ass I mean seriously

689
00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:03,520
makes me talk about this in our essay I

690
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:07,080
mean in all seriousness it's you know

691
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:10,770
there's that component of the - right so

692
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:14,850
it really is just not make a difference

693
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:14,850
it's got a another story

694
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:23,940
it's start to make it and when you start

695
00:31:20,259 --> 00:31:26,729
to get into into the Romans there's also

696
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:33,909
differences in how women are treated

697
00:31:26,729 --> 00:31:36,460
interacting in senior discussions and if

698
00:31:33,909 --> 00:31:39,909
you try to be smart aggressive assertive

699
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:42,190
and straightforward you get labeled in a

700
00:31:39,909 --> 00:31:42,879
circle with a certain word that company

701
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:45,580
knows what it is

702
00:31:42,879 --> 00:31:47,529
whereas if the men are that way they're

703
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:50,049
seeing those superstars yeah there's

704
00:31:47,529 --> 00:31:51,940
still those differences of bias even

705
00:31:50,049 --> 00:31:55,658
when you're giving later on and I see

706
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:57,940
just about every kind of the beat we're

707
00:31:55,659 --> 00:32:03,659
still there's still work to do there -

708
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:03,659
yeah - yes

709
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:10,890
differences and our boys I have a boy

710
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:13,350
and a girl and it's been really

711
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:15,450
interesting to raise both and see the

712
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:17,909
biases that other people are trying to

713
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:19,620
grow on my children like feelings and

714
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:21,540
that's not what he actually do in our

715
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:25,320
family you know we treat everybody

716
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:29,240
kindly your own voices and to watch them

717
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:29,240
as they interact there

718
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:36,518
absolutely want to hear from you

719
00:32:34,149 --> 00:32:38,500
absolutely I like the point for it is

720
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:40,450
you know different ones to get into the

721
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:42,490
space right and different meaning how

722
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:46,710
long it woman's been working with men in

723
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:51,039
side-by-side how many years everybody no

724
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:52,779
no I think in the workforce police in

725
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:55,320
terms of having the right to vote having

726
00:32:52,779 --> 00:32:58,450
to say even be able to get into the room

727
00:32:55,320 --> 00:33:00,250
from you know we need an executive and a

728
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:01,990
software company you doing

729
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:04,419
that's only didn't it's been in the

730
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:08,679
making for 40 years as our entire

731
00:33:04,419 --> 00:33:10,690
existence so it's a it's new how do we

732
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:12,549
work together so those were here and

733
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:15,179
then how do we work how does sex not get

734
00:33:12,549 --> 00:33:17,620
in the way how does you know all of that

735
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:22,960
you know passed judgment a Syrian so

736
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:24,908
it's not get in the way yeah yeah you

737
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,490
know it's funny because sometimes is

738
00:33:24,909 --> 00:33:34,659
attributed to gender bias by to see that

739
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:36,549
there's I had that person get provoked

740
00:33:34,659 --> 00:33:37,960
he doesn't know how to deal with people

741
00:33:36,549 --> 00:33:40,720
he doesn't even know how to manage

742
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:42,639
problems he treats his people terribly

743
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,080
and so you see things like that it's

744
00:33:42,639 --> 00:33:49,870
because there's just not enough emphasis

745
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:52,299
on soft skills yes and what's yeah so I

746
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:55,239
do feel you know very upset about seeing

747
00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:56,679
that it's terrible effects everybody and

748
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,419
then there's about the cultural thing

749
00:33:56,679 --> 00:34:00,340
you mentioned - yeah people from

750
00:33:58,419 --> 00:34:02,380
different cultures like in Japan you're

751
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:04,750
interviewing you're not supposed to brag

752
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:06,320
about your accomplishments so there's

753
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:08,629
these cultural aspects that

754
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:11,089
to promote people into these positions

755
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:12,649
because they they're very outgoing and

756
00:34:11,089 --> 00:34:15,168
even though they're it's horrible fit

757
00:34:12,649 --> 00:34:16,638
for the job absolutely absolutely we

758
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:20,569
have little training on the management

759
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:22,339
leadership soft skills and we see people

760
00:34:20,569 --> 00:34:24,770
moving jobs every eighteen months that's

761
00:34:22,339 --> 00:34:26,418
massive disruption of humans not getting

762
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:29,060
along that means I like you and now I

763
00:34:26,418 --> 00:34:45,348
need you like that's terrible

764
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:47,299
and it's happening everywhere yes you

765
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:49,909
know I think that there's two things for

766
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:52,609
me one is I would say work to change it

767
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:55,040
quickly and then get out right meaning

768
00:34:52,609 --> 00:34:57,250
don't stay around the place where people

769
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:00,740
aren't interested in treating others

770
00:34:57,250 --> 00:35:02,750
kindly and making such that everybody's

771
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:04,729
got an even playing field but the best

772
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:06,920
way to make all those people up is to

773
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:10,690
leave them behind right to not

774
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:13,190
participate in their in their game so

775
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:15,349
however lovely I've never worked in one

776
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:19,300
of those cultures thank goodness maybe

777
00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:19,300
one of the other liaison matter

778
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:28,480
right yeah the linen is called you're

779
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:31,120
not woke my 26 year old my Salesforce

780
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,470
team told me about the other day and I

781
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:34,270
was talking about this person just

782
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:36,490
couldn't get what I'm saying he's not

783
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:38,380
oak then I guess beyond saving a song

784
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:42,430
it's very common terms means you're not

785
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:44,110
awake and it is physical for those that

786
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:46,270
haven't experienced that they to meet

787
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:48,400
awake and that's why I say help them get

788
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:50,200
away and they don't wake up get the hell

789
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,870
out because you know it's not gonna be

790
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:56,770
fun you're too hot of the quantity

791
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:59,529
that's the great news yes so I have two

792
00:35:56,770 --> 00:36:01,000
Yoder's and I think environmental you

793
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:03,280
know what you're surrounded in your

794
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,900
family home plays a really big part you

795
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,640
know if you have very gender specific

796
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:08,800
roles sometimes that's what you see you

797
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:12,250
watch TV that's what you see I'd like to

798
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:14,440
ask the ladies up here how much is your

799
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:16,030
upbringing influenced where you are

800
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:19,560
today based on how you proceed

801
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:19,560
yourselves if at any

802
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:34,930
in chemical engineering that's where he

803
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:37,810
pushed me to do science and and he

804
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:40,330
always encouraged us maybe sometimes he

805
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:42,580
pushed got really really hard to get out

806
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:45,759
of our comfort zone and try new things

807
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:47,259
so I think yes any created order you

808
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,910
know if you are bringing your family

809
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:50,910
your surrounding environment who

810
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:59,049
completely agree my parents took me to a

811
00:36:53,740 --> 00:37:00,549
lot of science museums and I like to say

812
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,990
I come from a lot of female scientists

813
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:04,210
my mother was a nurse my grandmother was

814
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:08,680
a biochemist and you know they both work

815
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:10,240
part time and so I had this you know set

816
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:14,250
of elders that were encouraging and

817
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:14,250
interest in this and then definitely

818
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:22,510
we all did yeah definitely my dad expose

819
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:24,970
me to science that says great love and

820
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:27,370
we used to do it together on weekends

821
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:30,430
but I'm saying that I do remember being

822
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:33,460
told you know what if you don't want

823
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:36,220
those kind of studies it's okay I did

824
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:40,060
get this message and I was resetting it

825
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:42,819
I do remember as a kid seeing this you

826
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:45,310
know it's okay you don't go to the

827
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:50,880
highest grade in math it's okay it was

828
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:53,740
just okay thing I had one sister she is

829
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:56,290
support engineer both of us ended up

830
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:59,259
learning science and being in the

831
00:37:56,290 --> 00:38:02,500
software industry and when I go to speak

832
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:05,320
with my mom I asked her how come you

833
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:07,660
told me not to do those things and he

834
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:10,900
didn't push me and she was like because

835
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:15,670
I didn't think that I can do it when I

836
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:19,780
was your age we didn't do it so she just

837
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:21,880
now got walking kind of a weight in it

838
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:24,190
it's possible because she is from this

839
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:26,560
generation that you know what it's okay

840
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:28,270
you learn you meditate you do arts and

841
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,130
you get married and everything's gonna

842
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:32,110
be fine

843
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:36,250
so she was like I thought that's a good

844
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:38,350
thing to do but it's interesting the

845
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:41,080
generation gap that we see yeah

846
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:43,120
absolutely it's women are that were our

847
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:45,370
mentor is still not my mother to shoes

848
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:47,500
teacher LA City School drove two hours

849
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:50,970
every day got seven kids I was number

850
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:53,670
seven you know and she never

851
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:55,680
said to me get it go do something you

852
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:57,300
know ever beat while my father from the

853
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:00,330
Middle East an immigrant engineer

854
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:02,250
pushing my brothers to be engineers one

855
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:04,500
of them is one of the one CEO he's an

856
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:08,040
attorney and you know I graduated high

857
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:10,200
school like what we doing okay college

858
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:12,540
cool and of course you know look

859
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:14,100
fast-forward but I'll tell you what as

860
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:16,410
much as it was sort of it was okay if I

861
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:19,020
didn't my stepfather who was

862
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:21,120
african-american in my life my mistakes

863
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:23,520
he was always telling me your leader

864
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:24,900
you're amazing people love you do

865
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:27,090
something good with it but you just

866
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:29,460
can't say your leader your leader and I

867
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:31,020
there's no way that didn't affect me you

868
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:32,760
know in terms of my confidence and

869
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:34,500
willing to take rest you can get out

870
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:36,180
there and that's why it's an actually we

871
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:39,540
don't do because I think whether it's

872
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:42,180
our parents or somebody else it's gotta

873
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:44,700
be that and that's the opportunity feast

874
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:49,080
right it's going to go back to our

875
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:52,770
original topic of the special careers in

876
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:54,270
cybersecurity that although healthcare

877
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:56,100
traditionally been kind to women

878
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:57,840
leadership and there's a ton of women

879
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:59,759
leadership in health care or in the IT

880
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:02,880
space and then the security space we've

881
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:05,310
only seen as much but I encourage that

882
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,900
you know if you really want to study and

883
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:09,540
hone your skills in this specific area

884
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:11,490
maybe go bury yourself in an industry

885
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:14,160
didn't quite work for me because now

886
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:16,500
healthcare cybersecurity that's probably

887
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:18,450
the larger body expected it to be in

888
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:20,160
terms of but you have political agenda

889
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:23,970
in the national spotlight right now with

890
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:25,470
medical record data breaches but you

891
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:26,939
know burying yourself in an industry you

892
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:27,720
actually have an interest in and then

893
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:30,060
working your way up

894
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:32,850
finally in that space allows you to make

895
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:34,950
lateral movement later so you know I I

896
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:36,569
would caution against you know thinking

897
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:38,910
that the company that you're progressing

898
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:40,620
the most of your time and might not be

899
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:42,240
any industry that's gonna have a sexy or

900
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:44,310
appealing it but it is going to give you

901
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,540
a talent and skills and let me kind of

902
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:48,029
sit back maybe and make those

903
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:51,259
observations that will improve your

904
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:51,260
career layer

905
00:40:53,290 --> 00:41:00,890
we've got seven more minutes how about

906
00:40:56,870 --> 00:41:02,359
some working with these ladies recently

907
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:05,060
heard some stories I didn't even

908
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:07,160
understand one of them just challenges

909
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:09,170
that women still have so if you're a man

910
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:10,790
and you're unhappy with your job and you

911
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:12,230
start looking for a job whenever you

912
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:14,509
feel like looking for a job well I

913
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:16,790
thought women did the same thing but I

914
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:18,890
found out because I didn't biologically

915
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:22,940
have children earth children I did not

916
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:26,690
know that you know women have to think

917
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:29,210
about that twice because most companies

918
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:32,870
won't pay for child birthing in the

919
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:35,360
first year right and so as a woman you

920
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:38,299
got to think about you know timing and

921
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:40,460
when you can move jobs and careers and

922
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:41,840
this still happens today and it's all

923
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:44,000
just about awareness and hopefully we

924
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:45,830
can all help change these policies I

925
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,480
don't think any organization would

926
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:49,460
really want a woman sitting around just

927
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:52,550
because right you don't think that's

928
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:55,790
good for anybody else or right so maybe

929
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:57,380
is all we we're out there working in our

930
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:58,880
everyday lives you can help change those

931
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:01,250
things we're just you know thinking of

932
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:03,890
things that are different for women than

933
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:06,530
for men then that is one and I bet you

934
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:07,970
it does hurt folks a lot in terms of

935
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:09,260
their ability to take risks or put

936
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:11,419
themselves out there or take that job

937
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:13,430
that they came across their life that

938
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:16,370
they would love to take but they know

939
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:19,279
they can't because the raiment or the

940
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:21,700
training agreements right crazy but true

941
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,700
yeah

942
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,160
Oh

943
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:56,820
I work in the same industry everything

944
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:58,850
was great and that's what I get

945
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:58,850
Oh

946
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:17,640
buddy you gotta do it or the operation

947
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:19,320
center you know I realized the crappy

948
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:21,839
movie under the new mom you know

949
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:24,000
whatever but then I realized this was an

950
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:26,550
investment a really really good person

951
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,750
she's looking at workforce for you your

952
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:29,750
company around a long time

953
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:44,869
yeah thank you and I approached

954
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:46,730
irritants will and her experience with

955
00:43:44,869 --> 00:43:48,410
your company we'll get back to her

956
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:52,030
colleagues her friends other people

957
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:52,029
locating which will give you more access

958
00:43:53,559 --> 00:43:59,240
so this might be a little controversial

959
00:43:55,910 --> 00:44:02,569
five to two questions first is when I

960
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:04,279
think about like not being correct if I

961
00:44:02,569 --> 00:44:06,200
had a position and like oh my god I need

962
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:08,450
to hire this person and then a woman who

963
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:11,299
is in her third trimester walks in to

964
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:12,439
interview my initial inclination is and

965
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:14,150
I don't know how to avoid this is like

966
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:15,410
oh my god I need this person to be like

967
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:16,790
working right now I've got this huge

968
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:18,200
project yeah because that's something

969
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:19,279
that shouldn't enter our train of

970
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:21,618
thought is that something that should

971
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,359
like how do you how do you balance it

972
00:44:21,619 --> 00:44:24,470
because I like I think I struggle a

973
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:27,410
little with that the other thing I

974
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:30,649
struggle with is that so a lot of

975
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:32,390
corporate policies reinforce mother's

976
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:34,630
care givers now I think childbirth or

977
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:37,089
obviously me like has a much more

978
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:40,870
physiological impact on

979
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:43,420
but it's much harder for the father to

980
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:45,490
try and take off and help raise the kid

981
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:48,430
for six months the buzz his company

982
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:51,310
gives him you know for six weeks and the

983
00:44:48,430 --> 00:45:01,629
woman three four or five months six

984
00:44:51,310 --> 00:45:04,990
months I think there was a point about

985
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:07,300
having a very candid discussion with

986
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:09,009
this candidate but when are you coming

987
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:11,200
back how available are you gonna be and

988
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:16,930
she may not know because it's also very

989
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:20,770
not all traumatic probably it probably

990
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:23,890
is I'm not allowed as an open policy and

991
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:26,800
stuff but I would bring it up if I come

992
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:30,160
to an interview on my third trimester

993
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:39,880
I'm gonna be real about it and because

994
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:44,649
I'm not gonna hide it right time we can

995
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:46,480
open it up my best employees were women

996
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:49,150
coming back from maternity leave because

997
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:51,670
they were so effective so efficient not

998
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:53,860
wasting a minute really going to get

999
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:56,710
things done and getting they didn't

1000
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:58,330
waste time in coffee chats and so not am

1001
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:59,950
saying that coffee chats are not

1002
00:45:58,330 --> 00:46:02,500
important for corporate culture but

1003
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:06,759
really there is something that I think

1004
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:09,100
we are being very much PC that prevents

1005
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:10,690
us from being human beings so I don't

1006
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:12,339
know what they do the same buddy

1007
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:14,410
I don't know what you know the rules of

1008
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:17,170
the conference is but I think it's a

1009
00:46:14,410 --> 00:46:20,560
shame not bringing in somebody in a

1010
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:22,690
third trimester if she do plans to be

1011
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:26,259
involved if she will catch up if she

1012
00:46:22,690 --> 00:46:29,860
will be full I have to tell you even

1013
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:31,850
though what if I do six months off I was

1014
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:34,400
very much involved with my team

1015
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:36,380
I was away important meetings I attended

1016
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:40,730
I was on conference calls

1017
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:43,550
so even when I was out I avoided people

1018
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:46,370
that could take over I think there is

1019
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:48,140
some flexibility that we can take us the

1020
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:50,600
same will happen if somebody gets sick

1021
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:52,460
if it's a male and you got sick and it

1022
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:56,690
needs to leave for well well that's why

1023
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:59,030
so that's my approach not sure that that

1024
00:46:56,690 --> 00:47:01,430
legal would improve on it it is

1025
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:02,600
interesting because I think that last

1026
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:04,850
thing you said it's really important if

1027
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:06,410
I am interviewing a pregnant woman and I

1028
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:07,610
want to bring up that conversation and

1029
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:08,899
then there's a better candidate that we

1030
00:47:07,610 --> 00:47:11,300
don't hire she would have a very

1031
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:15,440
legitimate claim of gender

1032
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:16,820
discrimination right yeah there's

1033
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:20,030
another attorney but like it just feels

1034
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:22,040
like that is a very taboo conversation

1035
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:23,660
my my wife works for a start-up she's

1036
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:25,850
worked for the same serial entrepreneur

1037
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:28,430
for four years we had a daughter like

1038
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:30,350
she just I mean she works when she has

1039
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:32,000
the flu like the legit spine flu she's

1040
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:35,240
like crawling to the desk and so I don't

1041
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,380
I don't think that that is like it's not

1042
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:37,759
that you're pregnant I can't hire you

1043
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:39,530
but it's the fact that we can't have

1044
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:41,090
that conversation and like anybody that

1045
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:42,710
says that thought doesn't cross their

1046
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:46,880
mind for a position that alone has an

1047
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:47,960
immediate need so I think yes I just

1048
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,910
think the fact that she would show up in

1049
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:52,880
her first third trimester but she's

1050
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:53,720
really she's got her stuff together I

1051
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,960
think you know what if we're giving

1052
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:58,939
errorless error on giving her the

1053
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:01,100
benefit of the doubt she's gonna make it

1054
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:06,010
work Sheena show Bruce make things

1055
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:06,009
happen when were fear for of legal

1056
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:12,680
that being said as a man who can help

1057
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:15,348
with policies in New York type of

1058
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:18,589
position I think that men are also being

1059
00:48:15,349 --> 00:48:21,170
left out of the childbearing experience

1060
00:48:18,589 --> 00:48:23,210
of those first critical three six-month

1061
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:24,920
centers so you know come you know

1062
00:48:23,210 --> 00:48:27,770
important and so I'd love to see you

1063
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:30,710
fighting for equal rights on that too

1064
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:33,080
because how nice would it be if a couple

1065
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:34,700
can decide who's going to be at home or

1066
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:37,310
based on their career and where it's at

1067
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:40,069
or be there together you know how that

1068
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:42,070
ability to even decide so I think we

1069
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:43,940
need to advance on that piece of it

1070
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:50,900
significantly those policies

1071
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:52,369
disadvantaged their career even though

1072
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:54,890
it might not make the most sense for the

1073
00:48:52,369 --> 00:48:56,480
family absolutely absolutely my horses

1074
00:48:54,890 --> 00:49:00,190
so the man's estate home based on where

1075
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:00,190
they're at so we need that yes

1076
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:11,420
have been subject to tax growling over

1077
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:14,099
here

1078
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:15,900
so got you aside so then I just went

1079
00:49:14,099 --> 00:49:18,650
through a job search and it's

1080
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:18,650
fascinating

1081
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:32,590
and whether I was prepared for the

1082
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:45,760
lifestyle or the startup world I can

1083
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:47,770
also tell you and this is they're

1084
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:50,190
bringing their perspective what I can

1085
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:50,190
tell you

1086
00:50:07,099 --> 00:50:10,059
that person

1087
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:15,830
even if we have to act weak

1088
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:23,049
I would never work and I will never

1089
00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:23,049
invite anybody to know to go work for so

1090
00:50:54,220 --> 00:51:02,299
well mosby well like i like like we

1091
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:03,650
can't like there there are terrible

1092
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:05,210
women leaders and there are terrible men

1093
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:08,060
leaders I don't think I've ever asked

1094
00:51:05,210 --> 00:51:09,110
somebody about about anything related to

1095
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:10,820
their family during a job interview

1096
00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:12,770
because it's not relevant to me right I

1097
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:14,450
do think there are very rare instances

1098
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:16,009
where it's irrelevant like there's a

1099
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:19,250
relevant concern to be had what if I

1100
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:21,650
want to hire somebody that is that needs

1101
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:23,870
you have a project that's um by q3 that

1102
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:25,130
is clearly gonna have a kid in the next

1103
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:27,020
three or four months like there are

1104
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:29,300
concerns that if we don't address this

1105
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:31,340
inside that society and have an open

1106
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:32,200
dialogue around without demonizing the

1107
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:34,700
fact that we're having the conversation

1108
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:36,589
there are things that will will continue

1109
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:37,819
to occur and that woman will continue to

1110
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:40,190
be discriminated against even though she

1111
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:41,840
got laid off and is 100% capable lately

1112
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:45,070
we have to talk about I have to figure

1113
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:45,070
out how you can have those dialogues

1114
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:59,300
yeah it's interesting because I asked

1115
00:51:57,650 --> 00:52:01,520
all those questions of men and women

1116
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:02,960
because I like to know who I'm hiring

1117
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:05,540
what do you do where do you compromise

1118
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:07,310
your story what your experience has been

1119
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:10,250
all of that what's your daily life like

1120
00:52:07,310 --> 00:52:14,060
such that I can understand the person

1121
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:16,280
and and so you know there's it's so

1122
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:18,799
complex right and there's a ton of fear

1123
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:21,320
to these conversations and questions and

1124
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,460
so this generation has to take you know

1125
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:23,930
the past generations and say you know

1126
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:26,720
we're not gonna operate the way you all

1127
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:29,540
operate and be bogged down by legalities

1128
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:31,939
and help fight for open transparent

1129
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:34,670
conversations and if we do that on top

1130
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:35,930
of being equals you know and we're all

1131
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:37,400
raising children that we're all

1132
00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:39,350
responsible for the children that we

1133
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:42,530
bring into this world together then you

1134
00:52:39,350 --> 00:52:44,870
know this is complex this is interesting

1135
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:46,550
which is cool it's so awesome that this

1136
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:49,910
community is embracing this topic and

1137
00:52:46,550 --> 00:52:51,410
RSA my talk from details to prom to

1138
