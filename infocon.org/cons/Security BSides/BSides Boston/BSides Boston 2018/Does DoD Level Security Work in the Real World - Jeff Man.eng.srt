okay welcome everyone the 11 o'clock

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,219
talk I'd like to introduce Jeff man I

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,809
first talked I think I won't do justice

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:13,290
for his resume so I'll let him take that

5
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:15,360
off as he introduces his talk here does

6
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:21,990
the DoD security work and the real work

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:23,220
so for everyone Jeff man okay hi

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,869
everybody

9
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,279
somebody take a picture me like it's

10
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:28,279
really cool I'm teaching at Harvard

11
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:34,890
slidebar some of the dumbest people I

12
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,349
ever met and I hope there's none in the

13
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:42,120
room that I offend our Harvard Business

14
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:46,260
School graduates just saying good way to

15
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:48,599
start I don't want to start with a quick

16
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:51,989
survey you know show of hands yell or

17
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,920
whatever does DoD security work in the

18
00:00:51,989 --> 00:01:01,849
real world how many people think yes

19
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:07,309
wait for the options in both don't know

20
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:07,309
they're waiting for me to tell you and

21
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:21,210
area we can do that why I asked this

22
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:24,270
question just real quickly just to frame

23
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,860
it just because what put this question

24
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,479
in my head years ago actually happened

25
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,900
not too far from here it was a customer

26
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:35,340
I had eight or nine years ago in the

27
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:37,500
Boston area shall we say and I actually

28
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,780
have to blame it on PCI I was there as a

29
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,759
qsa I was doing there PCI compliance

30
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,000
assessment it was a large merchant that

31
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:48,540
is located about 30 miles west of Boston

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,820
you do the math and I was spending an

33
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,470
afternoon explaining them what

34
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,020
encryption meant what it meant to

35
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:57,420
protect data at rest data that's being

36
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,950
stored and we were going through kind of

37
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,950
all the different options and because

38
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,509
I'm an X cryptographer of NSA I kind of

39
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,100
geek out a little bit when it comes to

40
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:07,200
things crypto so I was probably giving

41
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:10,109
them more detail than they really wanted

42
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,880
so at the end of this long explanation

43
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,440
which I thought was really

44
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,210
a good thing I was giving them a lot of

45
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,329
detail on what all these things meant

46
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:20,820
they said yeah that's nice but we don't

47
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:24,450
really need DoD level security so that's

48
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:26,579
kind of the birth of this talk you know

49
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,859
I think the what they said was we sell

50
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,290
women's clothing you know why do we care

51
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,120
but I actually have heard this time and

52
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:36,750
time again over the years of my work

53
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,940
especially in the PCI world Midwestern

54
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:41,310
companies but you know the Midwestern

55
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,960
mindset is you know we're just family

56
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:47,310
here everybody gets along why would

57
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:48,810
anybody steal things from us and and you

58
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:51,810
have different mindsets for different

59
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:54,090
companies three years so really honestly

60
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:56,340
this this this statement that this

61
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:59,130
person said eight or nine years ago is

62
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,720
stuck with me which can be disturbing at

63
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:03,870
times if that happens to you I don't

64
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,930
know maybe there's treatment anyway my

65
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:09,480
name is Jeff man I you can find me most

66
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:11,550
easily I'm often on security weekly and

67
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:16,170
one of the co-hosts I was recently

68
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:18,960
officially endowed as a promotion what

69
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:22,079
do you call it when you get ordained

70
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:24,570
whatever they used to work at NSA as a

71
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,490
pen tester another talk another day I'm

72
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:29,220
a Crypt analyst actually a cryptologist

73
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:32,700
I did I worked both sides I broke toads

74
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:34,950
and I actually designed codes at certain

75
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:39,350
points and I'm sort of currently

76
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:42,570
unaffiliated if anybody's hiring hire me

77
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:45,209
the the the masking thing that was

78
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:47,640
actually a job that I did when my PCI

79
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:49,350
customers actually produced food and to

80
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,299
get to their office we had to go to the

81
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:55,070
factory so I had to Don that stuff so I

82
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:58,890
thought it was cool anyway moving on

83
00:03:55,070 --> 00:04:01,799
I've been in the business information

84
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:04,589
security business for going on 34 years

85
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:08,700
now raise your hand if you're younger

86
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:11,290
than 34 34 or younger so imagine your

87
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:17,510
whole life

88
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:19,760
I've been doing into the suck so hold

89
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:22,760
that thought

90
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:24,320
tell you a little bit about my my most

91
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,849
recent claim to fame there was a book

92
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,349
that came out last year called dark

93
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:31,039
territory has anybody heard of it read

94
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:32,690
it by any chance the fourth chapter is a

95
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:35,240
chapter called eligible receiver

96
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:39,590
eligible receiver was the first massive

97
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:41,630
coordinated pen test that NSA performed

98
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:45,440
against its customer which was primarily

99
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:48,460
the DoD happened I believe back in 1997

100
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:51,500
which was a little bit after my time but

101
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:53,419
in that chapter there was this paragraph

102
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,160
the NSA had a similar group called the

103
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:56,960
red team it was part of information

104
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,850
assurance bla bla bla bla

105
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,919
it was stationed in Phoenix which they

106
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:03,860
misspelled friendship airport by the way

107
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:06,710
is BWI case anybody's ever been to the

108
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:08,630
Maryland area during its most sensitive

109
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:10,549
drills the red team worked out of a

110
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:13,039
chamber called the pit which was so

111
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:16,940
secret that few people at NSA knew it

112
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:18,560
existed sounds ominous right I actually

113
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:20,240
worked in the pit I was one of the

114
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:27,110
original members of the pit the pit was

115
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:29,419
simply our office and this is the fanox

116
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:31,550
complex that which is just west of the

117
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:33,620
BWI Airport that wrote up in the top is

118
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:35,840
what you drive into to drive into BWI if

119
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:38,539
you've ever been there and a little my

120
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,638
fancy laser Porter pointer all these

121
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:42,740
buildings at some point or another may

122
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,289
or may not have been affiliated or are

123
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:49,360
still affiliated with NSA and the pit

124
00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:53,000
was right there in that building band x3

125
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:56,060
as I jump into this talk I do want to

126
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,470
dedicate it to one of my oldest friends

127
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,900
and one of my mentors somebody that

128
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:02,360
watched over me more than I even

129
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:05,030
realized as I as I came to learn

130
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,280
recently she passed away the venom has

131
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:11,090
been a month now a couple weeks is it

132
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,948
three weeks she was one of the people

133
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:15,260
that was responsible for setting up the

134
00:06:12,949 --> 00:06:16,559
pit and having the idea that NSA should

135
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,989
do pen testing and read

136
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:21,899
the whole idea of testing the security

137
00:06:18,989 --> 00:06:24,839
of our systems our customer which was

138
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:26,699
the DoD primarily classified systems

139
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:28,949
before the bad guys could get to it was

140
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:32,039
a novel idea you know almost 25 years

141
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:33,449
ago she had a lot to do with that we

142
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:35,789
called her mom she was our den mother

143
00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:37,489
and she passed away so this is dedicated

144
00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:41,909
to you Becky

145
00:06:37,489 --> 00:06:46,669
deep breath diploma burp all I actually

146
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:49,469
started my career in 1984 and

147
00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:51,899
technically I didn't start at NSA my

148
00:06:49,469 --> 00:06:53,639
very first job was a summer intern job

149
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:56,429
between my junior and senior year of

150
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:58,079
college at what then was called the

151
00:06:56,429 --> 00:07:02,188
Naval Surface weapons center which was

152
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:04,049
also a facility in Maryland not too far

153
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:06,539
from where I lived my mom was actually

154
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:10,758
in personnel in HR so she helped me get

155
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:14,248
a job as an intern thanks mom

156
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:15,989
well I was technically not allowed it

157
00:07:14,249 --> 00:07:19,229
worked out really in my favor I wasn't

158
00:07:15,989 --> 00:07:21,328
allowed to be an intern because of the

159
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:23,489
Neptune if it is Amul but I was allowed

160
00:07:21,329 --> 00:07:25,619
to be hired as a temporary employee and

161
00:07:23,489 --> 00:07:27,419
so at the end of the summer I didn't

162
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:28,679
like stop working I went on leave

163
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:30,508
without paying I came home at

164
00:07:28,679 --> 00:07:31,708
Thanksgiving and Christmas worked here

165
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:33,989
and there and then I had a job

166
00:07:31,709 --> 00:07:35,639
immediately after I graduated and I

167
00:07:33,989 --> 00:07:40,289
worked there for several months until I

168
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:43,229
ended up at NSA thanks for asking but my

169
00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:46,049
very first job I got I was working for a

170
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:48,599
physicist that did any submarine warfare

171
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:50,938
that was what he did it research on and

172
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:52,049
he had gotten some money and would end

173
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:54,839
bought this one of these newfangled

174
00:07:52,049 --> 00:07:57,929
devices called a desktop PC I'm pretty

175
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:59,519
sure that's the model I was using and he

176
00:07:57,929 --> 00:08:01,289
hired me because he had this filing

177
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:04,289
cabinet that's locked safe that was

178
00:08:01,289 --> 00:08:06,869
filled with as it turned out about 25 30

179
00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:09,419
years of research reports white papers

180
00:08:06,869 --> 00:08:11,659
documents books anything that he was

181
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:14,339
able to collect on any submarine warfare

182
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:18,259
you know I was a young young college

183
00:08:14,339 --> 00:08:20,969
student 20 hello was a in 1984 22 and

184
00:08:18,259 --> 00:08:22,169
when I started with him he said well I

185
00:08:20,969 --> 00:08:24,569
need to explain to you what any

186
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:25,960
submarine warfare is and probably the

187
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:27,550
best way to explain it

188
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,830
this book came out recently called The

189
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:30,550
Hunt for Red October just read it it's

190
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:33,098
what we do

191
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:34,479
so my first week on the job working for

192
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:37,360
the government I got to read a book I

193
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,669
thought it was really cool so that was

194
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,690
my job I went into this safe and for the

195
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:42,549
people to raise their hand because

196
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:44,200
they're younger than 34 I found

197
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:45,939
documents in this safe that had been

198
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,910
checked out of the technical library of

199
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:50,800
this research facility before I was born

200
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:52,839
so I had one of those moments wasn't

201
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,910
quite as long as only 22 years but I'm

202
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,190
like wow this documents been sitting in

203
00:08:54,910 --> 00:09:02,439
this drawer in this safe from my entire

204
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:05,649
life so it was kind of weird but my

205
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:08,050
first experience in security really was

206
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:11,050
that I committed a security violation

207
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:13,750
and I came in one morning you can read

208
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:17,290
it there and basically I had left the

209
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:20,830
safe unlocked and I was like well what's

210
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:22,540
the big deal I'm I'm in a building

211
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:25,470
that's surrounded by barbed wire fence

212
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:27,939
no not anybody can get into the grounds

213
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:30,160
to get into the building you have to go

214
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:32,260
past security and I don't think we had

215
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,730
that exact turnstile but you get the

216
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:36,430
idea you had to pay you had to get

217
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:38,980
through somebody the office that I was

218
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:40,420
in had a lock on the door and you know

219
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:43,300
you had to know the combination to get

220
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:44,649
in and security actually walked the

221
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,719
halls at night they would roam around

222
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:48,880
looking for bad guys and people sneaking

223
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,800
in and you know burglars and whoever

224
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,089
which is how they found that the safe

225
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,800
wasn't locks because they would go into

226
00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:55,870
all the offices and try all the safes

227
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,699
and how I discovered that I had a

228
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:58,899
violation was I opened the safe because

229
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,300
they had locked it and there was this

230
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:03,370
pink slip of paper saying come see us at

231
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:07,089
security and never

232
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:08,800
and it's a big deal so I was young I was

233
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:10,540
naive and I thought what's the big deal

234
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,520
you know there's all these layers of

235
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:15,189
protection who cares if I left the safe

236
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:19,810
online so remember that

237
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:21,970
so this DoD security work in the real

238
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:23,619
world if I'm going to have a

239
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:27,900
conversation we need to start with maybe

240
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:30,790
defining some terminology okay so I

241
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:33,069
think a lot of people when they hear

242
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:35,290
about DoD level security they're

243
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:40,540
thinking well that's just some you know

244
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:42,339
nth degree of security you know no holds

245
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:44,020
barred on the amount of money the amount

246
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:46,300
of investment you can buy all the tools

247
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:48,670
and multiples of every types of tools

248
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:50,829
and technology and and sort of the sky's

249
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:53,589
the limit but that's not really what I'm

250
00:10:50,830 --> 00:11:00,340
talking about I might know what movie

251
00:10:53,590 --> 00:11:02,200
that is by the way very good the the DoD

252
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:04,630
type of security that I grew up in

253
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,400
especially at NSA it had many many

254
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,870
disciplines and I just tried to capture

255
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,180
a few because I thought it'd be a cool

256
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:11,920
slide to say now what are the different

257
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:14,079
facets you know some of these were there

258
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,610
when I was there and of course we have

259
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18,220
to have cool abbreviations for

260
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:20,110
everything in the DoD so COMSEC is

261
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:22,750
communication security basically all

262
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:24,670
this extra security intelligence

263
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:26,310
there's signals intelligence satellite

264
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:29,170
intelligence communications intelligence

265
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:33,130
electronics intelligence so on and so

266
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:35,800
forth Tempest is emanations if you've

267
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:37,300
ever seen pictures of the campus of NSA

268
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:40,209
there's a couple buildings that are kind

269
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:43,959
of mysterious and black and big huge

270
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:46,420
squares there they're actually built

271
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:48,130
copper-clad the entire building is

272
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,990
tempest protected - somebody had the

273
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:52,060
idea why we just build the tempest

274
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:53,800
protection the emanations protection

275
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,939
around the old building and then we

276
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,310
don't have to care about what's on the

277
00:11:54,940 --> 00:12:00,430
inside whether the the monitors bleed

278
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:03,160
and project a hundred feet which they

279
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:05,920
may or may not do then and now in the

280
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:07,329
early days they were really bad anyway

281
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,640
there's a lot of different disciplines

282
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:11,110
when I'm thinking DoD level security I'm

283
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:15,400
thinking about all these different types

284
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:16,590
of things transmission security you may

285
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,360
not know what somebody's

286
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:20,250
but if you're a SEAL team and you're

287
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,570
deployed in a country and the adversary

288
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:24,480
can figure out where you're broadcasting

289
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:26,370
from bad things might happen to that

290
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,200
area so there's different facets and

291
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:33,330
there's different elements to DoD

292
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:35,550
security but in trying to describe DoD

293
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:39,300
level security one of the things I

294
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:41,699
learned early in my InfoSec career was

295
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:44,219
this concept of a risk equation now

296
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:47,040
there's many many risk equations out

297
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:49,050
there if you google it a friend of mine

298
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,189
just went to a doctorate program she

299
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:52,529
probably had to learn a few risk

300
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:56,279
equations and this is probably bringing

301
00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:58,320
back painful memories but I try to

302
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:59,970
reduce things down to the basic elements

303
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,120
and the basic element of the risk

304
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:04,800
equation is there's some sort of fancy

305
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,630
function that you can apply but it has

306
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,609
to do with vulnerability sort of what

307
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:09,990
are the weaknesses the threats who are

308
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:11,790
the bad guys that are trying to get you

309
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:13,950
and what you're doing to prevent or

310
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:16,110
protect yourself against it what we used

311
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:18,180
to call countermeasures this all rolls

312
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:19,980
into you know whatever you're doing or

313
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:23,670
not doing in terms of securing your

314
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:28,950
environment gives you with some sort of

315
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:33,540
value of risks in the DoD this value

316
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:36,060
again simplifying things most often has

317
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:38,339
to do with human life the concept of

318
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:40,109
national security to contest the the

319
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:42,390
context of protecting our troops

320
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:45,000
protecting national interests protecting

321
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:47,250
our allies and so forth the spies and

322
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,510
agents and people we've recruited that

323
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:51,030
are giving us all this super secret

324
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:52,530
information that we have to encrypt all

325
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:54,780
that kind of stuff oils down to

326
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:58,730
basically you can think of risk is a

327
00:13:54,780 --> 00:14:01,319
quantity of human life so remember that

328
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:04,830
as I said you know the parameters of

329
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:07,200
risk if you ever go to a trade show I'll

330
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:08,790
go out and ask some of the it's for

331
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,980
upstairs that's one of the companies are

332
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:12,540
out there that are talking about risks

333
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:15,300
and threats and vulnerability to simply

334
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:17,219
define the term you might be surprised

335
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,859
at the number of answers you get the

336
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:21,410
diversity of answers and

337
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:23,780
and you might even be surprised at how

338
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:27,110
some of the answers overlap but if you

339
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:28,910
recall and my big pet peeve I get on pet

340
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:31,700
peeves anybody else get on pet peeves

341
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:33,140
and rants but a lot of people talk about

342
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,700
threats these days when they're talking

343
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:36,290
about risk and they sort of equate the

344
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,510
two risks and threats are the same thing

345
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:44,630
no there's a risk equation threats an

346
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:49,670
element don't you guys get there anyway

347
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:52,460
elements of a risk equation also to in

348
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:54,680
terms of InfoSec you know this is sort

349
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:56,240
of classic nothing new if you've been to

350
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,339
school and learned in your history books

351
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,680
this is what it was all about back in

352
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:04,100
the day it was data security that's why

353
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:06,709
we lock things in a safe and the the

354
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:08,060
three concept of protecting data has to

355
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:10,550
do with confidentiality integrity

356
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:12,020
availability we called it CIA because

357
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:14,449
everything has to have an acronym and

358
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,930
it's basically can you somebody steal

359
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:16,790
the data

360
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:18,680
can somebody alter the data can somebody

361
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:20,480
make the data not available now

362
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:22,489
interesting in our internet-connected

363
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,110
computer world there's a few new

364
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:28,120
variations that have been applied to

365
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:28,120
this talk about that right now

366
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:32,990
I used to be a cryptographer I used to

367
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:35,030
design systems my first assignment was

368
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:37,550
working for the manual cryptosystem shop

369
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:39,050
for NSA so on the intersect the

370
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:40,609
defensive side so we used to deal with

371
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:42,680
one-time pads and as far as I'm

372
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:44,390
concerned it's been downhill from there

373
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,550
the one-time pad is unbreakable

374
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:48,350
if you want secure communications that

375
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:50,689
nobody can break use the one-time pad

376
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:56,600
use it properly use it once that's

377
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:58,670
that's the one-time part of it but it

378
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,470
doesn't get any better than that so as

379
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:03,550
far as I'm concerned in the last 2530

380
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:06,050
years we've taken perfect security and

381
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:08,180
watered it down because we've started to

382
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:10,490
apply a machine cryptography computer

383
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:12,140
based cryptography because we want our

384
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:13,730
information fast and we want to

385
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:15,199
transparently and we don't want to know

386
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:16,910
that there's things going on behind the

387
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,500
scenes and we don't have to want to have

388
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:19,969
to deal with keys and all that kind of

389
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,940
stuff we just want our data and we want

390
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:25,140
it now damn it we need to go back to

391
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:28,019
one-time pads

392
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:30,360
anyway so you remember at the very

393
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:32,010
beginning I said you know this person

394
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,930
that talked to me eight or nine years

395
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:35,700
ago we don't need DoD level security

396
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:39,779
that's always haunted me and especially

397
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:42,180
in the last couple years and you know

398
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:43,380
I've gotten lots of excuses and you know

399
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:45,449
you might be thinking of some of these

400
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:47,519
excuses already usually when we have the

401
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:50,579
discussion of how DoD level security

402
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:53,550
works or doesn't work money comes into

403
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:55,469
play the complexity or the perceived

404
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:57,540
complexity of you know we can't afford

405
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:59,760
to do all the different things we're you

406
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:01,860
know we're a different type of shop or

407
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,569
why should we care we're just a grocery

408
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:05,579
store we're just a restaurant we're just

409
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:07,500
a convenience store whatever it is and

410
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:09,448
really those companies in their defense

411
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,160
a lot of companies that are out there a

412
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:13,829
lot of organizations until they plugged

413
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,540
into the internet really didn't worry

414
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:17,639
about security and data security they

415
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:19,770
didn't have to but your brave new world

416
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,209
you plug into new technology and you

417
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:24,059
sort of have to be a responsible

418
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:26,850
corporate citizen and internet citizen

419
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:29,450
because you know by plugging in you're

420
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:32,790
you're assuming some sort of risk and

421
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:34,440
and not so much anymore but I really had

422
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:36,240
customers they're like well you know who

423
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,679
would dutch sucks nothing nothing bad

424
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:42,870
has ever happened to us and that we've

425
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:45,000
never had any problems before this too

426
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:47,549
is actually this is a sanitized network

427
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,400
diagram for a company that was a PCI

428
00:17:47,549 --> 00:17:53,910
customer actually again a boston-based

429
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:56,190
company I didn't intend that but the red

430
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:58,890
circles up there are supposed to be the

431
00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:00,419
card data environment PCI says put all

432
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:02,070
your systems together in one environment

433
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:03,990
and protect it and keep it safe from

434
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:05,340
everything else they don't require it

435
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:07,679
they recommend it it's called Network

436
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:11,220
segmentation that's clear as a bell

437
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:14,280
right there's no no crossover you get

438
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:16,679
the idea yeah I mean you know there's

439
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:18,178
not a lot going on here what bad could

440
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:19,910
happened so what if you're just selling

441
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:21,960
women's underwear

442
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:23,640
you know there's big boxes over there

443
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,470
mainframes and all that kind of stuff

444
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,270
these are representatives retail

445
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:30,150
locations they do things a couple ways

446
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:32,309
so on and so forth even that's probably

447
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:34,559
eight or nine years old I'm sure it's a

448
00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:38,250
lot better now

449
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:41,049
but in the last couple years as this

450
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:44,139
person what they said and keeps going

451
00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:46,090
around and round in my head I and

452
00:18:44,139 --> 00:18:48,729
especially you don't have to go very

453
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:50,379
long days weeks months in fact this

454
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:52,960
slide you it's hard to keep the slide

455
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:54,820
current but you know for all the

456
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,710
breaches that continue to be happening

457
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:58,090
and the large companies and the

458
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:59,529
companies we thought that were doing

459
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:02,678
things right or should know better

460
00:18:59,529 --> 00:19:06,370
government private sector even security

461
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:08,799
companies even some of the products we

462
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:12,070
use I got I got a chance to throw in

463
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:14,559
words so this is current it also updated

464
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:17,439
next week I'm sure but you know all

465
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,610
these things happen and I as a security

466
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,570
professional that's been in the business

467
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:24,668
for 34 years going on 35 have to do some

468
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:26,740
soul-searching and ask myself we as a

469
00:19:24,669 --> 00:19:28,990
community we as a culture we as a

470
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:32,350
society we as an industry are we really

471
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:35,200
doing anything better you know if we

472
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:37,059
think we've we think we've advanced if

473
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,919
we think the technologies advanced and

474
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:41,230
all the stuff that we're doing is so

475
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:42,820
good why does this still keep happening

476
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:47,139
which is why we have conferences and we

477
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:49,658
get together and talk about it things

478
00:19:47,139 --> 00:19:52,418
that I learned both from the DoD and

479
00:19:49,659 --> 00:19:54,220
over the course of my career in the

480
00:19:52,419 --> 00:19:56,860
private sector these are the typically

481
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:58,870
the reasons why networks are insecure

482
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:00,789
why your why your your enterprises

483
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:02,979
insecure and this is not new information

484
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:06,039
this is actually a slide that I use

485
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:07,450
probably 20 years ago trying to teach

486
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:09,100
people if you're going to connect to the

487
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:10,720
Internet in the early days you need to

488
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,519
have some someone to the security

489
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,500
program you need to have policies you

490
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:16,480
need to have rules you need to write

491
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:21,370
them down and you need to follow them

492
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:23,230
and but you know that all gets wrapped

493
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:25,209
up in people don't want to do that they

494
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:26,799
just want to buy the technology they

495
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:28,899
don't have the institutional knowledge

496
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,279
they don't they don't really understand

497
00:20:28,899 --> 00:20:31,870
this whole security thing they don't

498
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:35,019
understand the technology stuff they're

499
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:37,389
just plugging it in using it and money

500
00:20:35,019 --> 00:20:42,940
is a big factor you know that's that's

501
00:20:37,389 --> 00:20:45,350
true so the point of all this is as I

502
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:47,720
look at the world today and

503
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:50,090
how things continue to be insecure and

504
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,620
if you listen to enough talks you sort

505
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:54,350
of come away with Wow everything's just

506
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:58,370
incredibly broken and keeps us employed

507
00:20:54,350 --> 00:21:03,830
most of us not me it's weird how that

508
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:05,629
works out but you know I wanted to look

509
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:07,520
back in my career and look back on the

510
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:09,049
things that I'd learned in the DoD level

511
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,389
security especially the things that I

512
00:21:09,049 --> 00:21:13,520
don't see necessarily being implemented

513
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:16,940
in the commercial world in the real

514
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:19,158
world and explore a few ideas I'm not

515
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:21,080
saying this is the answer I'm not saying

516
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:23,000
I've got the answer I'm just throwing

517
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:25,789
this out as a conversation starter so

518
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,419
feel free to agree that feel free to

519
00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:28,370
disagree

520
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:30,679
feel free to dismiss what I'm saying

521
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:33,080
because I'm too old and don't know

522
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:35,120
what's going on whatever I just want to

523
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,500
throw out some ideas maybe to just to

524
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,299
get us thinking about is there a

525
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:40,970
different way of doing things and maybe

526
00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:42,049
we don't maybe the point is we're not we

527
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:44,270
don't need to come up with something new

528
00:21:42,049 --> 00:21:45,799
maybe we need to go back and do some of

529
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:47,750
the things that we know we should have

530
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:50,590
been doing all along but for various

531
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,590
reasons we haven't

532
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:58,469
so the fundamental thing from a DoD

533
00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:01,200
perspective on the approach to security

534
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:06,779
is it's really about data it's it's it's

535
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:10,350
about information my favorite movie one

536
00:22:06,779 --> 00:22:11,490
of my favorite movies think well I guess

537
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:14,399
it says it right there

538
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:16,799
I do another talk where I have a lot of

539
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:19,709
movie slides and make people guess what

540
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:23,100
it is so yeah and who are the actors and

541
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:24,600
I remember their name but you know

542
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,908
there's a scene in this and it's toward

543
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,110
the end and and then these guys used to

544
00:22:26,909 --> 00:22:29,879
be friends and they used to hack

545
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:32,189
together in college to take oh they were

546
00:22:29,879 --> 00:22:34,379
Harvard or MIT I forget what I think

547
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:36,120
they were let's say they were here at

548
00:22:34,379 --> 00:22:38,820
Harvard but maybe not maybe it's Caltech

549
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:40,469
or something but you know they're having

550
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:42,928
a conversation towards the end and

551
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:44,850
they're talking about how in from you

552
00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:46,620
know where the world is it were I should

553
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:48,120
have been memorized I don't and and but

554
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:50,580
the war is not being fought with bullets

555
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:52,379
it's all about the information so again

556
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:54,740
it's all about the information the

557
00:22:52,379 --> 00:22:57,059
approach to security from a DoD

558
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:59,129
perspective starts with we have a set of

559
00:22:57,059 --> 00:23:03,570
information we need to protect it that's

560
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:06,418
where it all starts the risk equation

561
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:09,330
that I've discovered how it works best

562
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:11,669
in the real world is you got to start

563
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:15,840
putting dollars and cents on it

564
00:23:11,669 --> 00:23:18,509
the risk factor whatever that mythical

565
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,610
number that you come up with that is

566
00:23:18,509 --> 00:23:23,309
involved with whatever algorithm

567
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:25,529
whatever formula you want to apply and I

568
00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:27,539
try to be simplistic really in the

569
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:30,659
commercial world vault boils down to a

570
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:33,450
dollar figure remember the DoD version

571
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:35,549
is human life in the commercial world

572
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:37,799
it's a dollar figure that's a

573
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:39,809
significant difference in terms of the

574
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:41,820
approach to security as a practical

575
00:23:39,809 --> 00:23:43,139
matter and I acknowledge that I'm not

576
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:45,600
saying I have a good answer to get

577
00:23:43,139 --> 00:23:47,370
beyond that but you know there's

578
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,209
vulnerabilities out there I think we all

579
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:52,229
agree and and a lot of this business

580
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:53,730
worries about getting rid of all the

581
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:55,409
vulnerabilities and keeping ahead and

582
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:57,419
plugging all the holes and some people

583
00:23:55,409 --> 00:23:59,820
call it whack-a-mole some people will

584
00:23:57,419 --> 00:24:01,500
think of the the little Dutch boy trying

585
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:03,149
to plug all the holes in the dike I

586
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,649
sometimes think we should just

587
00:24:03,149 --> 00:24:06,570
acknowledge as a community that the

588
00:24:04,649 --> 00:24:07,799
vulnerabilities are here maybe we should

589
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,389
look at some of the other elements of

590
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:11,429
the risk equation maybe we can get more

591
00:24:09,389 --> 00:24:14,008
traction there but again just

592
00:24:11,429 --> 00:24:15,929
simplistically it's all about dollars

593
00:24:14,009 --> 00:24:19,139
and cents when you apply it to the

594
00:24:15,929 --> 00:24:21,720
commercial world so what can we learn

595
00:24:19,139 --> 00:24:25,620
from DoD level security one thing that

596
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:26,940
I've noticed is we tend to in the

597
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:28,979
commercial world we tend to treat

598
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:31,080
everything equal we focus on the

599
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:33,389
security of the network we focus on the

600
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,220
security of the systems and the data

601
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:37,649
that we're trying to protect as

602
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:39,149
organizations either we don't even

603
00:24:37,649 --> 00:24:40,649
really understand what it is what we

604
00:24:39,149 --> 00:24:42,899
have in terms of data and what's

605
00:24:40,649 --> 00:24:45,299
valuable or what's not we don't know

606
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:47,459
where it is stored we don't know where

607
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:50,179
it's processed and we don't know how we

608
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:52,740
get it in we don't know how it goes out

609
00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:55,169
we as an industry tend to focus on the

610
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:57,840
systems the networks and not necessarily

611
00:24:55,169 --> 00:25:00,000
the data I mean I had PCI customers

612
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,740
what's PCI its credit card security why

613
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,350
am I here credit card security I've

614
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:05,970
asked them what's our goal here they

615
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:07,320
couldn't answer the question I think

616
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:11,100
they thought it was a trick question but

617
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:12,629
it really wasn't in the DoD and we don't

618
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:15,059
need to go into details you know there's

619
00:25:12,629 --> 00:25:17,908
lots of different variations of this but

620
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:21,120
there's a concept of different types of

621
00:25:17,909 --> 00:25:22,559
data have different value and different

622
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,649
types of data have a different life

623
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:28,980
expectancy and the best way I can give

624
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:31,500
you an illustration is if you've seen a

625
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:35,129
war movie especially like Korea Vietnam

626
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:37,230
maybe some of the later movies where you

627
00:25:35,129 --> 00:25:39,090
know a Ground Force is deployed

628
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:41,580
somewhere and they're being attacked by

629
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:43,470
a machine-gun nest or you know the bad

630
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:45,658
guys out there somewhere so they want to

631
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:46,980
call in an airstrike and they're calling

632
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:48,539
in coordinates these days they'd

633
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:50,669
probably be GPS and it's a lot more

634
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:52,259
accurate but imagine Vietnam there's

635
00:25:50,669 --> 00:25:55,529
they're giving grid coordinates latitude

636
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:57,629
longitude you can imagine that the

637
00:25:55,529 --> 00:26:00,120
accuracy of that information is very

638
00:25:57,629 --> 00:26:01,949
important and it's very important to

639
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,600
make sure you're giving the coordinates

640
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:05,370
of the people that you actually want to

641
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,439
have the bombing or strafing run done

642
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:09,750
and not the good guys so that

643
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,370
information is very sensitive but that

644
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:13,080
information is only sensitive for maybe

645
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:14,729
a half an hour because once the bombing

646
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:16,769
runs been done whether that it worked or

647
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:18,010
not it's kind of moot that the

648
00:26:16,769 --> 00:26:21,549
coordinates were sent out

649
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:24,129
get that life expectancy we don't have

650
00:26:21,549 --> 00:26:25,330
that concept I think for the most part

651
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:27,340
in the commercial world with the

652
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:29,168
exception maybe financial data financial

653
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:32,439
records have to be retained for X number

654
00:26:29,169 --> 00:26:33,640
of years but even again most companies

655
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:35,380
that I've worked with over the years

656
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,210
that have that retention requirement

657
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:39,100
they don't know that it's okay to get

658
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:40,990
rid of it after seven years most

659
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:42,189
companies just Hendel tend to hoard

660
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:44,320
everything because they never know when

661
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:46,179
they're going to need it and don't even

662
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,340
get me started on email retention that's

663
00:26:46,179 --> 00:26:51,280
a whole different story

664
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:53,379
so there's this concept in the DoD of

665
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:55,000
different data has different value I

666
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:57,100
don't see that a whole lot in the

667
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,660
commercial world so I throw that out as

668
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:00,790
an idea of maybe that's something that

669
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:02,380
we should consider maybe we need to look

670
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:03,760
at our systems and networks and try to

671
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:05,919
figure out what we're actually dealing

672
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,840
with maybe we should try to understand

673
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:10,179
what type of data what time it type of

674
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:13,299
information we have and assign some sort

675
00:27:10,179 --> 00:27:15,580
of value to it now yes a lot of

676
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:17,950
companies have data classification but

677
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:19,418
it's usually in most cases and raise

678
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:20,830
your hand if you've seen an exception

679
00:27:19,419 --> 00:27:23,260
it's usually you know public

680
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:25,870
unclassified or company confidential I

681
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:27,250
mean it's it's usually binary and again

682
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:29,678
it's like we have to protect it at all

683
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:31,480
costs we don't know why or for how long

684
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:35,169
but we just know we have to do it or

685
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:36,850
yeah it's ok the light out there the

686
00:27:35,169 --> 00:27:40,240
concept of security and depth this is

687
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:42,129
not a new concept this is a aerial view

688
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,350
of a city I went to States in Italy and

689
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:46,540
the city was building in like medieval

690
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:49,959
times you can see that there's layers

691
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:52,330
there you can imagine that the the the

692
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,669
king or the ruler whoever was the head

693
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:57,510
guy you can you can figure out where he

694
00:27:54,669 --> 00:28:00,910
was in the time of conflict

695
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:02,679
and the whole idea is and again this is

696
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:04,600
not a new concept we talk about network

697
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:07,330
segmentation we talk about security and

698
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:09,189
depth but I don't see a lot of companies

699
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:11,799
and organizations talking about it from

700
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:13,660
the perspective of it's okay for things

701
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:16,480
on the perimeter to kind of go by the

702
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:18,160
wayside I think you I wrote a blog

703
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:21,160
article a couple months ago talking

704
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:23,770
about the whole concept of perimeter

705
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:26,020
security which is really what this is an

706
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:28,090
illustration of especially in the early

707
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:30,580
days plugging into the internet internet

708
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:31,870
bad corporate network good you know and

709
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:34,090
you worked your way in so you have this

710
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:36,250
concept of demilitarized zones and you

711
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:38,559
work your way in with increasing trust

712
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:40,030
let's kind of gone now because where the

713
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,620
heck is the perimeter these days when

714
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:45,309
we've got clouds and we've got mobile

715
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:47,709
devices who knows but the idea of

716
00:28:45,309 --> 00:28:49,540
segmentation I still think is important

717
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:51,429
to consider especially if you've figured

718
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:53,080
out what your data is and figured out

719
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:55,030
some data is more or less important than

720
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:57,129
other data maybe you want to put it in

721
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:59,860
different places but the other thing too

722
00:28:57,130 --> 00:29:02,169
is there was a concept at least when I

723
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:04,689
was at NSA applying this principle of

724
00:29:02,169 --> 00:29:06,700
security and depth is your systems don't

725
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:09,370
alternate ultimately have to be secure

726
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:11,200
forever your systems have to be secure

727
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:14,260
enough that it's more costly in terms of

728
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,720
time and resources to make it worthwhile

729
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:18,850
for the bad guy to go through it to get

730
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,990
to it and that's a weird concept that I

731
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:22,540
don't see a whole lot in the public

732
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:28,600
sector the idea that just you know we

733
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:31,570
used to measure the veracity of a system

734
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:33,070
its value by the it used to be the gross

735
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:35,139
national product nowadays of course

736
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:37,870
domestic product whole nother talk to

737
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:39,730
discuss about but we would say okay we

738
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:42,100
have a particular adversary guess what

739
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:44,950
was in the mid 80s for early 90s and

740
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:46,899
what's their GNP and how much of that

741
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,580
GNP would they dedicate to going after

742
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:50,530
this set of information and we would

743
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:52,330
calculate this is how secure we needed

744
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:54,580
to be we needed to make it we needed to

745
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:56,080
make it harder you know go through a

746
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:58,570
bunch of Hoops go through a bunch of

747
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,820
Hoops the hacker the bad guy he's going

748
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:04,629
to get bored it's not what this is time

749
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:07,689
and effort he's going to move on go back

750
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:09,639
to the the story that I told at the

751
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:12,820
beginning my first experience

752
00:30:09,639 --> 00:30:15,029
of security which was you know being

753
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:17,408
insecure and learning a valuable lesson

754
00:30:15,029 --> 00:30:20,079
you remember I said you know there was

755
00:30:17,409 --> 00:30:23,889
all these protections but as I look back

756
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:26,589
on it over the course of my career what

757
00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:28,689
I realized on reflection is what there

758
00:30:26,589 --> 00:30:31,329
was when I worked at this this this

759
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:33,579
Naval facility this naval research base

760
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:35,979
way back in the day was that there was a

761
00:30:33,579 --> 00:30:38,619
culture of security everybody understood

762
00:30:35,979 --> 00:30:40,479
their role everybody understood the

763
00:30:38,619 --> 00:30:42,458
rules everybody understood the

764
00:30:40,479 --> 00:30:44,320
importance of following the rules and

765
00:30:42,459 --> 00:30:46,659
everybody understood how they all work

766
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:49,178
together so yes there's a perimeter

767
00:30:46,659 --> 00:30:51,070
fence and that perimeter fence had

768
00:30:49,179 --> 00:30:53,829
security guards that would drive around

769
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:55,450
and why and inspected periodically make

770
00:30:53,829 --> 00:30:57,789
sure nobody cut holes in it it might

771
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:59,619
have had cameras on it depending on

772
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:01,539
which organization I worked with over

773
00:30:59,619 --> 00:31:03,820
the years it might even be motion

774
00:31:01,539 --> 00:31:08,679
sensors or detectors built into it

775
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:10,989
different associated countermeasures and

776
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:13,509
with all the countermeasures different

777
00:31:10,989 --> 00:31:15,729
processes and different rules same thing

778
00:31:13,509 --> 00:31:17,289
with the with the the front desks one of

779
00:31:15,729 --> 00:31:19,029
the rules at NSA was you know there's

780
00:31:17,289 --> 00:31:21,700
always a security guard watching you go

781
00:31:19,029 --> 00:31:23,229
through the turnstiles in the early days

782
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:25,959
we didn't have turnstiles but we had a

783
00:31:23,229 --> 00:31:29,079
picture badge and we had to show it and

784
00:31:25,959 --> 00:31:32,339
you know face saying face saying that

785
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:34,809
was the security guards you know tasks

786
00:31:32,339 --> 00:31:36,549
we went to a period I think was during

787
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:38,289
one of the conflicts where they thought

788
00:31:36,549 --> 00:31:41,229
the guards had gotten lazy so they just

789
00:31:38,289 --> 00:31:42,459
they had to touch the badge and some of

790
00:31:41,229 --> 00:31:44,559
the guards didn't like that so they got

791
00:31:42,459 --> 00:31:46,929
these little magic wand things feel like

792
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:48,908
they ripped antennas off their radio so

793
00:31:46,929 --> 00:31:52,389
like I touched your badge and it lives

794
00:31:48,909 --> 00:31:54,070
it was weird but the point was they

795
00:31:52,389 --> 00:31:55,629
followed a prophet they followed a rule

796
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:58,539
even though they kind of took liberties

797
00:31:55,629 --> 00:32:00,039
a little bit you know and the whole idea

798
00:31:58,539 --> 00:32:01,419
of having locks on the door sometimes

799
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:03,459
there was double locks you know the pit

800
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:05,379
had super-secret double layers if you

801
00:32:03,459 --> 00:32:08,499
believe that the book which I will

802
00:32:05,379 --> 00:32:09,668
neither confirm nor deny but you know

803
00:32:08,499 --> 00:32:12,309
change the change the combination

804
00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:14,679
periodically I remember when I won't say

805
00:32:12,309 --> 00:32:16,990
which office or when but they changed

806
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:18,909
the combination it happened to be this

807
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:20,710
the score of the Super Bowl that year

808
00:32:18,909 --> 00:32:23,760
because there somebody's favorite team

809
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:27,010
had won the Super Bowl yeah whatever

810
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:28,629
changed the you know good passwords you

811
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:29,110
know unguessable and all that kind of

812
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:31,210
stuff

813
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:33,668
again processes there's things built

814
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:35,110
into it and even the security guards one

815
00:32:33,669 --> 00:32:36,669
of the things that was very true

816
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:38,289
especially at NSA would they would

817
00:32:36,669 --> 00:32:40,510
rotate the security guards on the

818
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:42,879
regular basis not to give him a break

819
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:44,620
not to relieve boredom because but they

820
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,539
didn't want the security guards to get

821
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:48,428
you know get to know you on a personal

822
00:32:46,539 --> 00:32:50,440
level they didn't want facial

823
00:32:48,429 --> 00:32:51,730
recognition hello Jeff come on in you

824
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,830
know I've seen you come in every day for

825
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:55,419
the last three years I don't know that

826
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:57,340
you were fired yesterday and walked out

827
00:32:55,419 --> 00:32:59,169
they don't want that to happen so they

828
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:00,699
would rotate the guards to try to

829
00:32:59,169 --> 00:33:02,350
reinforce the fact that the guards

830
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:04,510
needed to look at the badge match the

831
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:05,678
face touch it during the time that they

832
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:10,210
had to touch it even though they could

833
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:12,159
use the magic wand I have taught for

834
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:13,659
many years and I learned this in the DoD

835
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:15,940
and tried to bring it out that you know

836
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:17,740
security when you when you start to take

837
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:19,630
a programmatic approach to it it's

838
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:21,250
really a life cycle it's really process

839
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:23,409
I like to talk about how security is

840
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:25,899
something you do it's not really a state

841
00:33:23,409 --> 00:33:27,669
that you achieve and in doing it

842
00:33:25,899 --> 00:33:30,158
requires all these processes all this

843
00:33:27,669 --> 00:33:32,830
working together all this things in flow

844
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:35,110
and in the early days we came up with

845
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:36,610
five steps probably because and this is

846
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:39,010
before when word had all these things

847
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:41,860
available or power panic we had to

848
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:44,140
actually make this one so again you know

849
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:46,000
in the early days it was let's start by

850
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:47,710
assessing the situation we were sewing

851
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,059
pen tests and vulnerability assessments

852
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:50,980
you're plugging into the internet but

853
00:33:49,059 --> 00:33:52,570
you have this existing network let's

854
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:54,549
figure out what's wrong and fix it and

855
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:56,320
and once we figured out what's wrong

856
00:33:54,549 --> 00:33:58,510
with developing strategies let's write

857
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:00,490
down the rules implemented so on and so

858
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:02,950
forth well we've advanced a whole lot

859
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:05,080
now we've got so five steps and they've

860
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:07,090
been changed a little bit but it still

861
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,539
figure out what's wrong so on and so

862
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:11,589
forth

863
00:34:07,539 --> 00:34:13,540
so is this better is this a proper

864
00:34:11,589 --> 00:34:15,820
application I'll leave that for you guys

865
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:18,219
to decide but notice the data is

866
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:21,520
considered an asset class to me data is

867
00:34:18,219 --> 00:34:24,489
the asset and everything else rotate is

868
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:27,790
rotating or revolving evolving revolving

869
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:29,250
around the data so maybe I don't agree

870
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:33,509
with that one UK

871
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:36,139
it's up to you again security is a life

872
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:38,399
cycle it's something that you have to do

873
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:41,490
and you have to start somewhere

874
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:43,379
I think most companies today are doing

875
00:34:41,489 --> 00:34:44,969
something already I mean they've been in

876
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:46,379
business a while they've been on the

877
00:34:44,969 --> 00:34:48,178
internet for a while they've been doing

878
00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:50,310
a security thing for a while to some

879
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:52,649
degree or another so the whole idea of

880
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:57,720
starting off and assessing maybe as a

881
00:34:52,649 --> 00:34:59,460
moot point but I still maintain that if

882
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,348
you don't know what you're doing if you

883
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:03,060
don't know what your target is what

884
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:04,710
you're trying to protect and where it is

885
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:05,250
and to what degree you need to protect

886
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:07,140
it

887
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:09,180
maybe you're setting yourself up for

888
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:12,240
failure or can we at least acknowledge

889
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:14,879
that the whole idea protect everything

890
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,950
to the same level at all costs isn't

891
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:20,970
really working we could flip back to

892
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:22,319
that slide for the hacks of the week the

893
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:24,419
last statement there I'm pretty sure I

894
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,859
have to give credit I bet that's

895
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:27,960
something I heard Marcus Ranum say

896
00:35:25,859 --> 00:35:31,020
probably 20 years ago when I went to one

897
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:32,670
of his talks in case you don't know who

898
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:36,240
Marcus Ranum is we've caught about that

899
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:37,830
last night he's effectively considered

900
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:40,049
the inventor of the firewall the

901
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:43,200
godfather of the firewall he built the

902
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:46,109
first firewall and he acknowledges that

903
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:48,689
he built it wrong but he's still famous

904
00:35:46,109 --> 00:35:50,790
for it but he you know talked that I

905
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:53,310
went to 20 years ago he was talk about

906
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:55,170
building a firewall policy how do you

907
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:56,520
know what rules to set on a firewall if

908
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:58,589
you don't have a policy to set of

909
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:01,640
guidelines a set of goals so security

910
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:06,029
yet without policy is simply technology

911
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:08,129
so throughout some sort of semi random

912
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:10,380
thoughts just to try to continue to

913
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:14,310
pique your interest hopefully and spark

914
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:16,980
a conversation I think the whole

915
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:19,830
security industry is as much to blame

916
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:21,660
for the things that we've talked about

917
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:25,589
in terms of the challenges especially

918
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:29,160
the whole money thing but in no

919
00:36:25,589 --> 00:36:31,170
particular order I think customers and

920
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,569
I've had this experience many times

921
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:34,740
where I'm trying to explain the process

922
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:36,240
and

923
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:37,529
and the cycle and they're like yeah yeah

924
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,709
we don't need that just tell us what to

925
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:42,960
buy and where to put it and what does

926
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:44,160
the blinky lights me and I don't want to

927
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,430
think about security I just want to know

928
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,930
I've got X in place and I'm good in the

929
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:49,680
early days I've got a firewall so I'm

930
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:51,810
good right here

931
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:54,000
I've got antivirus installed right so

932
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:57,720
I'm good you know in the list goes on

933
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,010
and on in to some degree you know

934
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,540
vendors run the industry in to some

935
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:02,820
degree it's not their fault but you know

936
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:04,890
the companies that do look to someone to

937
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:07,500
guide them or advise them about what to

938
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:10,140
do in terms of investing and and

939
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:12,599
building security they naturally turn to

940
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:14,549
the vendors because that's who's calling

941
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:16,770
them 20 times a day or sending them

942
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:18,390
emails and spamming them and so they

943
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:20,040
finally take the phone call and they

944
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:21,390
hear what they need to hear about this

945
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:29,339
is what you need and by the way I'm

946
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:31,710
selling it and it all works out I should

947
00:37:29,339 --> 00:37:33,210
add that bullet point that that's a

948
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:37,500
whole nother maybe this is why I'm

949
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:39,089
unemployed I think there's too much

950
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:41,190
focused on the technology hopefully

951
00:37:39,089 --> 00:37:42,900
you've gotten that feel to me it all

952
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:44,640
starts with the data the data happened

953
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:46,560
to resides on a lot of technology and

954
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:49,109
it's and the technology is important the

955
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,460
technology's not going away because I

956
00:37:49,109 --> 00:37:53,250
don't think most people are going to go

957
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:55,460
reverting back to a one-time pad taking

958
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:57,920
four hours to write out one page of text

959
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:59,940
they want the streaming video and

960
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:03,089
constantly updating their pictures and

961
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:05,580
snapchats and all that kind of stuff and

962
00:38:03,089 --> 00:38:07,230
I mentioned it earlier you know I think

963
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:08,520
sometimes we're focusing too much on the

964
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:10,349
vulnerability that certain keeps

965
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:12,330
certainly keeps a lot of us employed and

966
00:38:10,349 --> 00:38:14,070
it's certainly important I'm not saying

967
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:16,020
it's not important to understand what

968
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:17,670
the system's vulnerabilities are

969
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:19,710
but can we acknowledge that they're not

970
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:22,770
going away that we're never going to get

971
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:24,270
to this point where we're done because

972
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:25,320
as long as we're implementing technology

973
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:27,630
there's going to continue to be

974
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:30,060
vulnerabilities so maybe just maybe we

975
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:32,760
need to focus somewhere else and that's

976
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:33,869
related and I might not make a whole lot

977
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,220
of friends with this but I think a lot

978
00:38:33,869 --> 00:38:36,690
of that has to do with penetration

979
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:38,459
testing because very often the

980
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:40,970
penetration testing that goes on today

981
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:43,080
is focused on finding vulnerabilities

982
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:45,379
penetration tends testing when done

983
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:47,299
correctly and you can watch our episode

984
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:49,190
500 unsecured T weekly we had a panel

985
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:50,900
discussion on this should really be

986
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:52,940
emulating the threat it should really be

987
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:54,920
a fire bill it should be trying to act

988
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:57,650
like the bad guys and see how well they

989
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:59,150
do it breaking in or not and see how

990
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:01,520
well you do it detecting their

991
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:04,610
activities at the pen test that's what a

992
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:06,200
pen test should be and I mentioned that

993
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:07,430
earlier nobody seems to understand what

994
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,960
the difference between risk and threat

995
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:13,069
is they think it's synonymous

996
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:16,820
so the DoD gave us lots of really really

997
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:19,550
good guidelines on how to to secure

998
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:22,880
computers and systems and by familiar

999
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:26,660
with this know what it is you guys don't

1000
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:28,220
count it all it's called the rainbow

1001
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:30,649
series that all started with the top

1002
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:32,660
left corner the what was called the

1003
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:35,420
orange book cleverly because it adds an

1004
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:41,540
orange cover and I want to say that came

1005
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:43,220
out in 83 was a fine 85 and what was

1006
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:46,430
funny to me the first time I was handed

1007
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:48,649
the orange book was and when I first

1008
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:51,410
started there was maybe 10 books in the

1009
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:54,200
series maybe only eight but the the

1010
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:56,120
second book in this series was probably

1011
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:59,390
twice as thick as the orange book and

1012
00:39:56,120 --> 00:40:02,000
its title was a paraphrasing because I

1013
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:04,160
hadn't seen it in 25 years but is

1014
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,390
basically how to understand and

1015
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:11,029
interpret the orange book and it sort of

1016
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:12,529
went downhill from there so if you think

1017
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:14,240
that's over-the-top and overkill and

1018
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:17,240
useless and how does that apply to the

1019
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:21,979
real world I give you this I saw this on

1020
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:24,500
LinkedIn a couple months ago and you can

1021
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:26,210
if you search for a C so mind map you

1022
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:28,100
can google it and zoom in and read it

1023
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:29,810
but for all the small print that you

1024
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:32,150
can't read assume that that's a

1025
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:34,940
technology and the greatest blackish

1026
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:38,120
boxes are sort of domains if you will or

1027
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:41,120
areas you know things like business

1028
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:43,430
enablement project delivery lifecycle

1029
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:45,109
budget security architecture compliance

1030
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:47,419
and audit and so on and so forth

1031
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:50,510
this is all the stuff that CISOs have to

1032
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:52,520
know it's no wonder that companies

1033
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:53,840
continue to get broken because I don't

1034
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:56,960
know all this stuff nobody knows all

1035
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:58,490
this stuff this is another example again

1036
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,020
I saw this out on I think

1037
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:01,009
dinner Twitter somebody somebody tried

1038
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:03,410
to write down what all the different

1039
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:07,880
domains are within that word up there

1040
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:09,230
that I won't say you know again the

1041
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:11,720
colors mean different sort of major

1042
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:13,700
domain areas and sub bullets and again

1043
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:15,950
if you if you find this and read it in a

1044
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:17,540
small print assume that for each one of

1045
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:25,430
these things there's a technology behind

1046
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:34,460
it or a technology solution or tool and

1047
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:35,868
people I'm sorry yes so if you've been

1048
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:37,700
around for a little while you might have

1049
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:40,400
heard some variation of you know this

1050
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:41,810
whole information security revolves

1051
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,510
around people processes and technology

1052
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:46,430
and of course technology rules and if

1053
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:48,619
you're a consultant which I am and was

1054
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:51,020
you know we tend to focus on the people

1055
00:41:48,619 --> 00:41:52,670
in processes and people in processes are

1056
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:54,200
boring and it's not fun and you don't

1057
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:56,869
see a lot of blinky lights so people

1058
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:58,129
like to skip to the technology I submit

1059
00:41:56,869 --> 00:42:00,170
to you though that there's a missing

1060
00:41:58,130 --> 00:42:01,880
element and that's you don't do any of

1061
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:03,740
this stuff without understanding what

1062
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:05,270
the purpose is what the goal what are

1063
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:07,609
you trying to accomplish with your

1064
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:09,560
security program it's not enough to just

1065
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:10,970
do it just because everybody's doing it

1066
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:13,250
because you're connected to the internet

1067
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:15,348
and you have systems and networks and if

1068
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:17,060
you you can get spun around the axis

1069
00:42:15,349 --> 00:42:19,099
pretty quickly and we see it all the

1070
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:22,339
time because all this stuff is done

1071
00:42:19,099 --> 00:42:24,020
without a goal in mind and and how do

1072
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:26,390
you know if you're doing it well if you

1073
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:30,290
don't know what you're you know trying

1074
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:33,140
to achieve it's all about the

1075
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:35,960
information is just some of the my

1076
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:39,940
summary thoughts and I did not say that

1077
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:39,940
word once in this presentation ha

1078
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:46,560
very briefly actually let me go back

1079
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:48,210
knowledge and awareness is key after 34

1080
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:50,490
years in the business I think that

1081
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:52,760
probably the most important thing is we

1082
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:54,868
as a community we as an industry our

1083
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:57,240
customers our companies that we work for

1084
00:42:54,869 --> 00:42:59,220
I think the the biggest thing that we've

1085
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:00,720
lost from the DoD perspective is this

1086
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:02,520
idea of the culture of security

1087
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,868
everybody knows what they should and

1088
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:06,210
shouldn't do and everybody knows what

1089
00:43:03,869 --> 00:43:08,970
their responsibilities are and everybody

1090
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:10,710
understands bad behaviors and what and

1091
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:12,959
and it's reinforced that they shouldn't

1092
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:14,490
do bad behaviors just because they need

1093
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:17,609
to do it to make the deadline or because

1094
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:19,259
the boss says so you know and security

1095
00:43:17,609 --> 00:43:20,578
people are the worst they could they

1096
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:22,920
know how to bend the rules and break the

1097
00:43:20,579 --> 00:43:25,530
rules and bypass the rules and there's

1098
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:27,030
often times the worst offenders if you

1099
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:28,410
don't believe me go out and talk to some

1100
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:31,430
of them and find out some of the

1101
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:33,960
shortcuts they take so knowledge is key

1102
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:36,629
quick word about my sponsor which is

1103
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:39,240

thousands of topics they've got tens of

1106
00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:46,290
thousands of hours of video and it's

1107

free and you can take all the training

1109
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,560
you want if you want to get certified in

1110
00:43:50,369 --> 00:43:54,270
CPA CPD credit they've got different

1111
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,190
labs and different deeper levels of

1112
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:59,339
courses yes you have to start paying for

1113
00:43:56,190 --> 00:44:01,020
them it's really affordable and if

1114
00:43:59,339 --> 00:44:02,759
you're a company that has or you work

1115
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:05,280
for a company that has technology that

1116
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:08,099
has training associated or even with

1117
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,510
demos of what your product does they

1118
00:44:08,099 --> 00:44:11,579
would love to get that up there too

1119
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:13,440
they're trying to be a resource you know

1120
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:16,319
a one-stop shop if you will for

1121
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:19,200
everything related to IT and security so

1122
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:21,990
check them out cyber EIT it's free to

1123
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:24,480
register and I'm actually in the

1124
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:25,979
finishing up a course that will be up

1125
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,720
there probably in the next week or two

1126
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:31,680
so look for me is one of their

1127
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:32,250
contributors the art of the Jedi

1128
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:35,960
mind-trick

1129
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:38,640
learning effective communication skills

1130
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:41,130
they're expecting to have a million

1131
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:44,240
subscribers probably by the end of the

1132
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:46,410
so they get like 15,000 a week and and

1133
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:48,299
again it's one of these slides that you

1134
00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:50,759
can keep updated but they've got lots of

1135
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:52,260
really cool you know I can't say that

1136
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,580
it's all great information because

1137
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:55,800
they're sucking in everything and they

1138
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:57,299
don't necessarily curate it all but

1139
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:59,910
they've got a pretty functional search

1140
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:02,040
feature and you can there's just a lot

1141
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:04,799
of material out there I encourage you to

1142
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:06,630
at least check it out so any questions

1143
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:10,800
or comments we've got a 5 or 10 minutes

1144
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:23,730
left I'm available push back disagree

1145
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:49,500
agree anything yes you're talking

1146
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:51,810
gibberish what is all that stuff well

1147
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:53,430
two things one I should have been

1148
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:56,700
passing a microphone out for you to ask

1149
00:45:53,430 --> 00:46:01,470
the question where the somebody should

1150
00:45:56,700 --> 00:46:04,500
do it and once you get the mic in your

1151
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:06,839
hand my question back to you is clarify

1152
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:07,920
what you mean by this storm just so I'll

1153
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:10,680
make sure I understand that

1154
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:12,780
so I'd say probably over the past year

1155
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,859
or so I you know maybe about 18 months

1156
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:16,110
ago I got like you know one

1157
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:17,730
questionnaire you know and then in the

1158
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:18,780
past year I've had probably five or six

1159
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:20,340
questionnaires from different

1160
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:22,290
contractors you know that we work with

1161
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:24,330
as a subcontractor every one of them you

1162
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:26,190
know it's anywhere from one to ten pages

1163
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:27,960
and they might use Google's open source

1164
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:29,940
contraption to design it or they use

1165
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:31,110
somebody's you know write a question

1166
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:32,310
after question after question has a

1167
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:34,590
question you know a lot of stuff where

1168
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:36,000
frankly probably one in NDA you know

1169
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:38,280
just to give them that information you

1170
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,230
know are these the kind of things do you

1171
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:41,490
see this trend in clear experience in

1172
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:42,720
the industry increasing that we're going

1173
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:46,169
to expect to see more and more of these

1174
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:48,450
things you know is there you know I mean

1175
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:49,530
you know ISO certificate 27001 maybe

1176
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:51,689
might be able to help you this kind of

1177
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:52,890
stuff I mean do you see is this a storm

1178
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:54,330
maybe that we're just going to have the

1179
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:55,109
weather and maybe this will just die off

1180
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:57,210
you know in the end

1181
00:46:55,109 --> 00:47:00,180
you'll get tired of it well my opinion

1182
00:46:57,210 --> 00:47:01,680
and others can weigh in but I think in

1183
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:04,739
the industry over the years it's sort of

1184
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:07,078
a pendulum swing and while there's this

1185
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:10,470
occasional recognition we need to do

1186
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:15,289
more the people processes things often

1187
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:18,450
it boils down to endless checklists and

1188
00:47:15,289 --> 00:47:21,230
you know what's missing is that over in

1189
00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:23,339
my opinion the overarching overarching

1190
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:24,989
understanding of security the goals and

1191
00:47:23,339 --> 00:47:27,720
objectives which of those questions

1192
00:47:24,989 --> 00:47:31,410
apply and don't is it okay to say n/a

1193
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:33,868
and that's an acceptable answer most

1194
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:35,519
Comeau srem illy ER with PTI the most

1195
00:47:33,869 --> 00:47:37,950
compliance standards is I've read

1196
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:41,788
through them are fairly good in terms of

1197
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:43,439
if you're running this do this in you

1198
00:47:41,789 --> 00:47:45,660
know rinse lather lather rinse and

1199
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:50,430
repeat that a thousand times over what

1200
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:52,440
they don't do is say you're this type of

1201
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:54,930
company doing this type of business with

1202
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:57,509
this type of data so this subset applies

1203
00:47:54,930 --> 00:47:58,799
to you they sort of expect you to figure

1204
00:47:57,509 --> 00:48:00,480
all that out here's everything in the

1205
00:47:58,799 --> 00:48:03,630
kitchen sink I mean to think the rainbow

1206
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:05,670
series every possible permutation you

1207
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:08,700
can think of technology it's out there

1208
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:10,319
and how to secure it you know more

1209
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:11,999
recently that would be probably the NIST

1210
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:15,450
cybersecurity framework you mentioned

1211
00:48:11,999 --> 00:48:18,569
some of the other things HIPPA I was

1212
00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:20,489
asked to do a talk on HIPAA year or two

1213
00:48:18,569 --> 00:48:23,489
ago so I like sat down to learn hipbones

1214
00:48:20,489 --> 00:48:25,650
like okay you need to protect private

1215
00:48:23,489 --> 00:48:28,380
health data I'm like okay what is that I

1216
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:29,999
have yet to find the definition it I'm

1217
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:32,910
totally serious there is not a

1218
00:48:29,999 --> 00:48:35,788
definition of thi within the HIPAA

1219
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:39,118
standard there's examples there's a

1220
00:48:35,789 --> 00:48:41,190
broad sort of framework if you know it's

1221
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:43,109
any information that's helps healthcare

1222
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:47,160
related that ties back to an individual

1223
00:48:43,109 --> 00:48:51,359
that's sort of a definition but it sort

1224
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:53,910
of left up to the user the consumer that

1225
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:56,489
has to follow HIPAA to figure that out

1226
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:58,470
and then apply what needs to apply so

1227
00:48:56,489 --> 00:49:00,269
there's a disconnect and I think the

1228
00:48:58,470 --> 00:49:02,129
pendulum swing is okay we do a lot of

1229
00:49:00,269 --> 00:49:04,288
Technology ok we know we need to do some

1230
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:05,400
process what we don't know how to do

1231
00:49:04,289 --> 00:49:06,720
that so let's just throw out some

1232
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,489
questionnaires and we don't know what

1233
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,730
applies or doesn't apply so fill out

1234
00:49:08,489 --> 00:49:10,080
every

1235
00:49:08,730 --> 00:49:13,650
because I don't know that's what they

1236
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:16,170
told us to do I thought you met candy

1237
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:19,470
bars so I actually do acquisitions for

1238
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:20,010
this DMV and theoretically with said

1239
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:23,189
Gramps

1240
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:26,550
it's supposed to be do once in youth

1241
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:30,000
betting so that's the whole idea so

1242
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:31,860
theoretically it should slow down but

1243
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,330
that's just that it needs to be a

1244
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:35,640
continuous haka

1245
00:49:33,330 --> 00:49:36,980
and I think that's going to be the

1246
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:42,270
cultural shift

1247
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:44,100
I think ironically what I have hopefully

1248
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:46,470
described a little bit in a way that's

1249
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:48,480
understandable understandable the dod

1250
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:51,209
level security largely doesn't exist in

1251
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:53,070
the DoD today they lost the

1252
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:56,280
institutional knowledge they lost the

1253
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:59,280
culture and and and and most recently

1254
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:01,740
the DoD is tried to sort of adapt the

1255
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:04,190
way the real world does it back into the

1256
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:06,930
DoD which I think's ironic and

1257
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:11,180
interesting and disturbing all at the

1258
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:14,069
same time did you have a question I

1259
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:16,470
think we're looking for the perfect

1260
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:19,230
state of security and everybody wants to

1261
00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:21,209
point to a standard to say if that's

1262
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:24,090
perfect we're going to measure ourselves

1263
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:26,160
against perfection but if we start

1264
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:28,140
shifting our mindset around the fact

1265
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:31,020
that security is never a destination

1266
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:33,810
it's a journey right then how can we

1267
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:35,430
have these perfect standards so sending

1268
00:50:33,810 --> 00:50:38,400
out all these surveys is great it's

1269
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:40,879
always just a moment in time and as long

1270
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:44,450
as organizations walk into it with that

1271
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:48,180
then I think it won't feel so

1272
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:52,080
overwhelming yep we are we used to talk

1273
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:53,790
about the four PCI practice the week

1274
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:55,890
that I was part of we used to talk to

1275
00:50:53,790 --> 00:50:57,630
our customers about treating security as

1276
00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:59,700
a program and not a project at you know

1277
00:50:57,630 --> 00:51:02,460
it's an ongoing thing question there and

1278
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:04,970
then in the back so I mean I kind of

1279
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:06,840
feel like you set yourself up for

1280
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:08,790
finding a lot of companies that are very

1281
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:11,460
focused on compliance by it by doing the

1282
00:51:08,790 --> 00:51:12,779
PCI thing but at the same time when you

1283
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:16,830
when you go and you look at a new

1284
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:19,410
company needs of you other than just

1285
00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:21,090
sitting down and and taking a good long

1286
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:22,299
time to really understand their culture

1287
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:24,309
and get a feel for particular

1288
00:51:22,299 --> 00:51:26,019
individuals what what are the key marks

1289
00:51:24,309 --> 00:51:27,910
that you you noticed that say to you

1290
00:51:26,019 --> 00:51:31,779
this company actually does have a

1291
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:38,170
culture of security you're assuming that

1292
00:51:31,779 --> 00:51:40,150
I found one that has that yeah I did

1293
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:43,359
consulting for many years before I was

1294
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:44,949
sent to PCI purgatory and I used to talk

1295
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:48,160
back then about the companies that we

1296
00:51:44,949 --> 00:51:49,869
would approach that hire to just hired

1297
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:52,239
us to do a pen test or vulnerability

1298
00:51:49,869 --> 00:51:54,219
assessment the ones that said well we

1299
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:57,099
just you know I'm going to date myself

1300
00:51:54,219 --> 00:51:58,779
and so we had one company that said we

1301
00:51:57,099 --> 00:52:01,269
just we just installed the gauntlet and

1302
00:51:58,779 --> 00:52:04,029
we went to training so we're good we

1303
00:52:01,269 --> 00:52:05,890
want you to pen testers and I was just

1304
00:52:04,029 --> 00:52:08,019
doing some you know port scanning

1305
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:09,910
remotely and like I don't even see a

1306
00:52:08,019 --> 00:52:12,669
firewall I'm seeing everything long

1307
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:19,089
story short ended up guess what the last

1308
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:20,859
rule was on their firewall so I've had

1309
00:52:19,089 --> 00:52:22,839
many companies that say oh we don't

1310
00:52:20,859 --> 00:52:24,759
store that data we don't capture that

1311
00:52:22,839 --> 00:52:26,890
kind of data I had a PCI customer they

1312
00:52:24,759 --> 00:52:28,809
had a web screen you know ecommerce site

1313
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:30,098
where they asked for the CVV I'm like

1314
00:52:28,809 --> 00:52:31,959
what do you do with that well we just

1315
00:52:30,099 --> 00:52:33,549
throw it away like yeah that's going to

1316
00:52:31,959 --> 00:52:35,348
come back to bite them and guess what I

1317
00:52:33,549 --> 00:52:37,089
found when I was looking at their

1318
00:52:35,349 --> 00:52:38,140
database it was encrypted but that

1319
00:52:37,089 --> 00:52:41,499
doesn't matter you're not allowed to

1320
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:44,199
keep the CVV so the flipside to that is

1321
00:52:41,499 --> 00:52:47,589
the companies that perhaps had the right

1322
00:52:44,199 --> 00:52:49,359
attitude were the ones and I we could

1323
00:52:47,589 --> 00:52:51,939
say it was a culture there are the ones

1324
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:54,519
that would come to us and say well we're

1325
00:52:51,939 --> 00:52:57,009
trying to do the best things we think

1326
00:52:54,519 --> 00:53:00,038
we're doing okay we think we've covered

1327
00:52:57,009 --> 00:53:03,459
our bases that we're not sure and we

1328
00:53:00,039 --> 00:53:05,349
want you to test us those companies we

1329
00:53:03,459 --> 00:53:08,890
often had a very hard time breaking into

1330
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:10,689
and and but they had a had an attitude

1331
00:53:08,890 --> 00:53:12,759
of humility which I guess is corporate

1332
00:53:10,689 --> 00:53:14,049
culture that okay we think we're doing

1333
00:53:12,759 --> 00:53:16,660
okay but we don't know what we don't

1334
00:53:14,049 --> 00:53:18,939
know find this out they tended to be

1335
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:21,069
more secure we had a hard harder time

1336
00:53:18,939 --> 00:53:23,499
breaking into them and finding all the

1337
00:53:21,069 --> 00:53:24,788
vulnerabilities and the holes

1338
00:53:23,499 --> 00:53:27,368
did you work your way to the back yes

1339
00:53:24,789 --> 00:53:30,220
PCI is slightly different than the

1340
00:53:27,369 --> 00:53:32,319
od model weird the DoD has actually

1341
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:34,890
started to a whole what's old is new

1342
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:38,349
again they don't fit capsid I cap to RMF

1343
00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:40,029
yeah again they've gone back I have no

1344
00:53:38,349 --> 00:53:42,490
idea what these acronyms are yeah

1345
00:53:40,029 --> 00:53:45,759
they've gone back to we are tt

1346
00:53:42,490 --> 00:53:47,680
associated and you never defined risk

1347
00:53:45,759 --> 00:53:49,359
tolerance because you seem to kind of

1348
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:52,598
defined risk and then you kind of talked

1349
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:55,119
around what the risk then define risk as

1350
00:53:52,599 --> 00:53:57,249
I said it's an equation and I've talked

1351
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:59,740
about the elements risk tolerance what

1352
00:53:57,249 --> 00:54:01,959
does risk mean to somebody well risk is

1353
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:03,999
how much risk are you willing to endure

1354
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:07,450
in order to get your job done or you

1355
00:54:03,999 --> 00:54:10,058
complete your mission alright so I'm

1356
00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:12,279
just wondering you know PCI is very firm

1357
00:54:10,059 --> 00:54:15,220
it's you must protect you know the

1358
00:54:12,279 --> 00:54:19,329
credit card information privacy

1359
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:22,629
information etc same is HIPAA but we you

1360
00:54:19,329 --> 00:54:27,299
do will you draw the same risk analysis

1361
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:30,490
for say a laptop that goes out to do

1362
00:54:27,299 --> 00:54:34,450
recruiting as you would for a laptop

1363
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:37,598
that does encryption or pen testing well

1364
00:54:34,450 --> 00:54:38,919
so I didn't mention risk tolerance and I

1365
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:41,349
probably should thank you for bringing

1366
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:43,839
that up the idea of risk tolerance is is

1367
00:54:41,349 --> 00:54:46,059
different for everybody I mean you know

1368
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:48,759
you got out of bed this morning and walk

1369
00:54:46,059 --> 00:54:50,920
out of your dumb mcdo mesial and you

1370
00:54:48,759 --> 00:54:53,410
know got into a car by walking whatever

1371
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:55,539
that's a risk it's a risk to roll out of

1372
00:54:53,410 --> 00:54:57,879
bed that most of us take a lot of risks

1373
00:54:55,539 --> 00:55:01,869
I get on an airplane frequently that's

1374
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:04,109
risky I'm married with children that's

1375
00:55:01,869 --> 00:55:06,700
risky

1376
00:55:04,109 --> 00:55:09,519
you know the idea of risk tolerance you

1377
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:11,680
know in our sense it risk tolerance

1378
00:55:09,519 --> 00:55:13,689
usually boils down to again it's a money

1379
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:16,149
thing how much are you risking willing

1380
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:19,029
to risk losing how much you willing to

1381
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:20,890
risk being fined you know I've had PCI

1382
00:55:19,029 --> 00:55:22,509
customers that weren't compliant and

1383
00:55:20,890 --> 00:55:23,769
they acknowledge that and they paid the

1384
00:55:22,509 --> 00:55:25,509
fine while they were on a past

1385
00:55:23,769 --> 00:55:27,189
compliance but that became a part of

1386
00:55:25,509 --> 00:55:29,079
doing I had one customer several

1387
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:31,809
customers that like yeah we'll just pay

1388
00:55:29,079 --> 00:55:34,420
the fine that's that's a perfectly valid

1389
00:55:31,809 --> 00:55:38,920
risk tolerance decision but it's not my

1390
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:40,170
decision necessarily yes we so PCI is

1391
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:41,160
different and everybody for

1392
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:44,280
yourself I'm going to say something

1393
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:46,410
vaguely supportive of PCI the challenge

1394
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:48,990
with risk tolerance and PCI in

1395
00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:54,299
particular and other compliance issues

1396
00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:57,839
is externalities you have to follow PCI

1397
00:55:54,299 --> 00:56:01,079
because if I'm an irresponsible merchant

1398
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:03,540
it can cost you money if my credit card

1399
00:56:01,079 --> 00:56:07,829
data gets popped and then somebody comes

1400
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:09,390
to your store spins money you're the one

1401
00:56:07,829 --> 00:56:11,910
as the merchant that gets taken so we

1402
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:15,930
have a we have a financial externality

1403
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:18,598
that actually justifies something like

1404
00:56:15,930 --> 00:56:22,169
PCI I won't say it justifies PCI so if

1405
00:56:18,599 --> 00:56:24,770
you're willing to accept the risk that

1406
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:28,740
doesn't mean that you should be able to

1407
00:56:24,770 --> 00:56:31,380
endanger the entire financial system

1408
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:33,959
because you're irresponsible and that's

1409
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:35,849
where things like PCI come into play and

1410
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:37,890
if we don't actually do a good job then

1411
00:56:35,849 --> 00:56:40,230
heaven forbid people in Washington make

1412
00:56:37,890 --> 00:56:42,720
it laws and make it even worse for all

1413
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:45,000
of us yeah I mean it's kind of along the

1414
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:48,808
lines of why is it a law that you have

1415
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:52,920
to wear a seatbelt right you know why do

1416
00:56:48,809 --> 00:56:55,740
we have insurance why do we have what is

1417
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:59,280
it called uninsured insurance whatever

1418
00:56:55,740 --> 00:57:00,569
that things puts it uninsured driver

1419
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:05,309
insurance because everybody has

1420
00:57:00,569 --> 00:57:07,410
insurance right so yeah I agree I'm only

1421
00:57:05,309 --> 00:57:09,599
keeping you from lunch so feel free to

1422
00:57:07,410 --> 00:57:12,690
hang out and ask more questions or the

1423
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:14,400
bar or the tavern or I don't know where

1424
00:57:12,690 --> 00:57:16,880
let's run out to Harvard Yard real quick

1425
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,880
and take this
