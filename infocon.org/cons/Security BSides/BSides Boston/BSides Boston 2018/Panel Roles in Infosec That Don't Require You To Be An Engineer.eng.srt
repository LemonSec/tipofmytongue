1
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:10,200
so I guess we can probably get started

2
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,809
with this one our next panel of the day

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,239
it is about roles and info sex that

4
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:21,359
don't require you to be an engineer Josh

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:23,900
come on back down that's probably a

6
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,900
smart decision

7
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:33,269
platonically I hope but all right so we

8
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,589
can get right into this and how this

9
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,590
panel is going to work I don't know

10
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:40,140
exactly how keep just ran his but we'll

11
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:42,180
see how this one works so questions I

12
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,180
get a bunch of questions that I have for

13
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,739
our esteemed panel here hopefully we

14
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,840
can't stump them too much or anything

15
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:50,099
like that but at the same time if you

16
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,960
have questions that's going to be

17
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,780
awesome so go ahead and think of

18
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,649
questions I moderated a panel last year

19
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:00,570
and I think I asked people for questions

20
00:00:57,649 --> 00:01:02,609
potentially to be asked at the end but I

21
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,170
had Josh on the panel and I had Andy

22
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:06,570
Ellis from Akamai and those people just

23
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,729
talked to her ever so we kind of ran out

24
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:11,789
of time but we'll try to have time this

25
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:14,580
year for audience questions and see how

26
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:18,360
that kind of goes so who are the five of

27
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:20,009
us up here well just kind of really did

28
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,380
I miss spell your last name Rachel it's

29
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:24,420

30
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:27,630

31
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:34,820
that right now no I'm Lulu guy I'm going

32
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:34,820
to change my name now but PLAs is better

33
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:38,220
as soon as I saw it I'm like oh no

34
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,798
that's fine

35
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:46,408

to joining Optive this is my first job

60
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:38,500
in InfoSec I was in a completely

61
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,620
different industry and food service so I

62
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:45,310
actually managed a Applebee's of all

63
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:48,780

actually two months ago and this is also

68
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:02,620
my first job in information security

69
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:05,679
before hand I was a tech writer at

70
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:07,630
electric boat building submarines so bit

71
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:13,120
of a change there but I'm enjoying it so

72
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:17,040

73
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:20,910
Platts I am a demand generation

74
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:25,920
marketing manager at cyber reason and

75
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:29,829
this is my third job in cyber security I

76
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,510
previously worked at core security did

77
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:36,040
pentesting vulnerability management

78
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:38,079

00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:41,410
ssh communications security which did

80
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,550
encryption and user key management so

81
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:47,829
I've been working in cyber security for

82
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:50,380
about six years in marketing hi I'm

83
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:52,360
Susan Kaufman I'm a program manager at

84
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:55,180
ver code for those who don't know very

85
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:58,270
code we are a cloud-based solution for

86
00:03:55,180 --> 00:04:00,670
application security testing this is not

87
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:03,430
my first job at security I've been at

88
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:05,109
bare code for three years I was at EMC

89
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:07,210
for ten years before that and most of my

90
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:09,550
time at EMC was in security in some way

91
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:11,890
I worked in our corporate product

92
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:13,720
security organization where we developed

93
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:15,369
a secure development lifecycle process

94
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,459
for all of our software products and I

95
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:19,930
also ran vulnerability management and

96
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:22,659
other than that I've been in the world

97
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:25,020
of software for more decades than I'd

98
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,020
like to admit

99
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:40,430
and I actually ended up on moderating

100
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,590
this kind of last minute and it's kind

101
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:44,840
of interesting looking at the topic for

102
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:46,849
that you don't necessarily have to have

103
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,590
an engineering background to get into

104
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:51,110
info security I actually have two

105
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:52,789
degrees in sports medicine that really

106
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:55,160
has nothing to do with information

107
00:04:52,789 --> 00:04:56,630
security whatsoever I grew up wanting to

108
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,430
work in major league baseball that was

109
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:00,110
that's what I was going to do so that's

110
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:02,000
what I went to college to do I went to

111
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:04,820
minor league baseball and those bus

112
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,169
rides are terrible so after about three

113
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,490
years I decided I want to do that

114
00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:09,979
anymore and believe it or not where I

115
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:11,660
got my start was right here and one of

116
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:13,758
maybe even this room I can't really

117
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:16,160
remember I took some really terrible job

118
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,020
at Harvard working for some person and

119
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,460
they have the extension school here

120
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:21,380
which is like one of the best deals ever

121
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:24,650
if you work at Harvard you can take

122
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:26,120
classes for like $40.00 and I just took

123
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:28,099
a whole bunch of programming classes and

124
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,900
then ended up teaching programming in

125
00:05:28,099 --> 00:05:32,570
places and moved on to information

126
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:35,989
security so I taught first son teaching

127
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:38,419
Java moved on to a university teaching

128
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:40,580
you know the office products and some

129
00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:42,740
kind of things became a web developer

130
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:43,340
for a whole bunch of years and then one

131
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,930
day

132
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,820
Akamai called me up and said you want to

133
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:49,639
work on our blue team defending networks

134
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:51,349
that sounds awesome so you can actually

135
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:53,570
move from it doesn't matter where you

136
00:05:51,349 --> 00:05:55,070
start you can move into this field and

137
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:57,409
that's really what we wanted this panel

138
00:05:55,070 --> 00:06:00,710
to be about is people like us who

139
00:05:57,409 --> 00:06:02,780
haven't been into the computer since

140
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:04,758
they were 8 years old and haven't been

141
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:06,409
working toward this but you can still

142
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:08,000
get places in the information security

143
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:11,960
field without a background in

144
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,570
engineering all right let's say what

145
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,909
most prepared you to work in InfoSec I'm

146
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:20,710
going to start with that one Susan sure

147
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:25,280
so I have a degree in economics

148
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:26,539
incredibly useful really only useful if

149
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,179
you want to be a college professor and

150
00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:31,699
you go on and get a PhD but I did take

151
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:34,639
some computer science classes a long

152
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:37,400
time ago in a galaxy far far away and I

153
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,930
think that actually was helpful

154
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,120
because I wanted to write code but I

155
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:43,100
understood the process and I had a

156
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,410
number of jobs before I ever got into

157
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:48,470
anything involved in software but it

158
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:51,229
came to information security by chance I

159
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:53,509
was working managing product releases at

160
00:06:51,229 --> 00:06:55,639
EMC and a customer reported a

161
00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:56,900
vulnerability and I ended up having to

162
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:59,660
work with our product security

163
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:01,609
organization to help get that through

164
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:03,919
the process managed to fix manage the

165
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:07,789
communications and deal with the

166
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,719
customer and I was very engaged with the

167
00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:10,159
folks who were working in product

168
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,530
security I was interested in what they

169
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,060
were doing built a relationship and then

170
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:16,340
when they had an opportunity they asked

171
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:19,160
me to come and join them and that was 12

172
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:21,530
ish or so years ago so I almost like

173
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:24,460
restarted my career with that and went

174
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:24,460
in a completely different direction

175
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:33,500
um I this is a weird question because I

176
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:38,659
don't think anything prepared me to work

177
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:42,410
and InfoSec to be honest but I I think

178
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:45,860
understanding how business businesses

179
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:47,210
run is important because a lot of people

180
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:50,510
all of the companies I had worked at

181
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:51,979
before I mean I the first company I

182
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:53,810
worked at out of college I don't even

183
00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:55,280
know if we had a security team like it

184
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,990
was just something that I know we had an

185
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,429
IT department that you know the guy

186
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:01,639
called when like my computer wouldn't

187
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:05,030
start but security was not on my radar

188
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:06,590
at all so I think understanding how

189
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:10,880
business works and the relationship

190
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:13,849
between IT and security is a good prep

191
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:16,880
kind of understanding that and then I

192
00:08:13,849 --> 00:08:20,180
think just being somewhat tech savvy

193
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:23,750
like understanding how the internet came

194
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:26,300
to be and like how computers generally

195
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:30,260
work I know that sounds like very simple

196
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:34,279
but like when I started my first job at

197
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:36,349
SSH I didn't know what a server was and

198
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:39,588
like a client-server and I was like what

199
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:41,150
would so I think understanding just the

200
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:43,130
basics of and not necessarily like

201
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:48,010
taking a computer science class but just

202
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:48,010
understanding technology

203
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:54,160
so what most prepared me to work in

204
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:56,920
InfoSec I think was actually working on

205
00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:00,069
submarine systems if any of you are

206
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:04,439
familiar with submarines they much like

207
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:10,860
the Internet are a series of tubes so

208
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:14,530
but seriously submarines are a

209
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:17,140
incredibly complex pile of machinery

210
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:18,670
that nobody totally understands and I

211
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:23,140
like to think of computers in the same

212
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:25,390
way they're both sort of something that

213
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:27,960
you have to take apart piece by piece

214
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:29,890
and start to specialize in and

215
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:33,460
information security is a lot in the

216
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:35,860
same way there's a lot of stuff going on

217
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:38,020
and the only way to really take it all

218
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:40,210
in and deal with it is to just take it

219
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:44,590
piece by piece and try to adapt to it as

220
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:46,690
it comes to you so I have a slightly

221
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:48,820
different take so I working on the sales

222
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:51,100
side you know I have to really be

223
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:53,200
engaged in me the business processes and

224
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:55,630
really any project that's sold from from

225
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,330
start to finish so I would say looking

226
00:09:55,630 --> 00:10:00,100
back what prepared me the most is the

227
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:02,290
years I spent in foodservice dealing

228
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,790
with you know upset customers especially

229
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:06,310
when I went to the manager training at

230
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:08,740
Applebee's you know they spent a lot of

231
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:10,660
time and emphasis teaching us how to

232
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,730
defuse situations you know somebody has

233
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:15,069
an undercooked meal how do you handle

234
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:16,780
that right so my role as a client

235
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:19,240
director in helping my clients navigate

236
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:21,160
various different projects you know as

237
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,650
we know no project ever goes smoothly as

238
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:25,630
planned right there's always setbacks

239
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:27,459
and twists and turns so really what's

240
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:30,010
prepared me the most is really learning

241
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:31,900
how to defuse those situations and help

242
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:34,000
steer it from a negative experience into

243
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:35,110
more of a positive experience I think

244
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,920
that's really linked to a lot of the

245
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,920
success so

246
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,960
about Jordan what do you wish you are

247
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:49,390
more prepared for or more prepared about

248
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:51,370
when you started your job in InfoSec two

249
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:55,360
months ago yes okay

250
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:57,100
so I have to admit when I came in I I

251
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,500
thought I was super knowledgeable about

252
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:01,330
computers I had you know played with

253
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,970
them for years taking them apart but and

254
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:08,200
put them back together but when I came

255
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:10,000
in what I realized was that no matter

256
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:13,450
how much you think you know there's

257
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,310
always more to know so when I got into

258
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:19,690
information security the first thing

259
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:23,439
that really baffled me was Python I had

260
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:25,990
some experience in C++ beforehand but it

261
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,210
was not nearly enough to help me

262
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:30,490
understand the you know complex

263
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:33,820
scripting tools that a lot of the

264
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:36,400
penetration testing team uses so before

265
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:39,100
hand I really wish that I just sort of I

266
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:42,329
guess tried to get that same mindset

267
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:45,610
that a programmer has when they try to

268
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:49,089
create a piece of software to accomplish

269
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:51,100
a task having that sort of ability to

270
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:53,500
break things down into individual

271
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:56,260
processes and sort of put it all

272
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:59,140
together to work is something I'm still

273
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:01,569
working on developing today and if I can

274
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:04,330
also tell a little story about Jordan

275
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:06,550
can actually work together we both work

276
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:09,160
at rapid seven and at rapid seven we

277
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:13,449
have a team of about 25 30 or so pen

278
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:15,339
testers and I know a lot of pen testers

279
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:17,230
and there's brilliant pen testers all

280
00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:20,880
around the world and on our team we also

281
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:23,680
have some really smart guys and when

282
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,420
Jordan was hired one of the very

283
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,699
probably not the first thing but one of

284
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:28,930
the first things he got sent to do was

285
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:31,210
to come to this thing that we call

286
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:33,219
hackathon and hackathon is when we get

287
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:34,990
most of our pen testing team together in

288
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:37,930
a building and we kind of just all work

289
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:39,370
together and you can imagine my head

290
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:40,839
spins when I look at some of these other

291
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:43,180
guys on my team and some of the stuff

292
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:45,940
they know and here's Jordan starting his

293
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:49,900
job first job in InfoSec walking into a

294
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:51,550
room of 20 or 30 pen testers with the IT

295
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:53,949
and hacking and all that kind of stuff

296
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:56,829
flying around and then to make it even

297
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:58,480
or badass by him on Wednesday night of

298
00:12:56,830 --> 00:13:00,850
hackathon we have what we call our mini

299
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,290
con where everybody's encouraged to kind

300
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:03,550
of present on something for about 10

301
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:05,290
minutes and everybody's up there showing

302
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,939
this new hack this different hack that

303
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,870
they're going to do he just signed right

304
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,280
up and he's up there giving a

305
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,360
presentation with everybody else and I

306
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,430
thought it was one of the most valuable

307
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,810
ones that anybody on the team gave and

308
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:15,969
he's just like I'm one of you guys I'm

309
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:18,160
right here with you so that was one of

310
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:20,560
Jordans kind of badass moments I think

311
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:29,140
with starting in InfoSec right you

312
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:31,359
haechul um so I think going into my

313
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,980
first job and looking back at that and

314
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,470
what I know now I think the most

315
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:39,790
alarming thing I'm sure this applies to

316
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:42,610
other industries but how big the spaces

317
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:44,500
and how many different types of products

318
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:46,480
and platforms and solutions and

319
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:51,700
technology there is out there and just

320
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:54,460
trying to understand how those each of

321
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:56,530
those apply to how business runs and

322
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:58,210
what a CISOs thinks of when he's

323
00:13:56,530 --> 00:14:01,000
building out his stack you know

324
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:02,590
understanding why they think AV is

325
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,350
necessary why they think firewall is

326
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:07,330
necessary and what type of solutions are

327
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:09,190
necessary and understanding sim and how

328
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:11,410
where that sits and how that fits into

329
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:13,540
everything else that's happening and DLP

330
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:16,900
and instant response and just really

331
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:18,760
understanding like from a business mind

332
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:21,130
when someone is building out their

333
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:23,380
security stack all the things that they

334
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:26,740
need in order to keep the business safe

335
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:28,930
and going into my first job it was an

336
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:33,400
encryption company and we did like keys

337
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:35,920
you know SSH key management and I think

338
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:38,020
of like encryption and as such SSH keys

339
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:42,640
and stuff as like a tiny little part of

340
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:44,170
like the entire landscape now and so you

341
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:47,380
know reading more about that and trying

342
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:49,689
to talk to seas or security analysts or

343
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:53,170
whoever maybe to kind of understand the

344
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:56,280
business side of of a security stack in

345
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:56,280
that entire space

346
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:02,349
so I actually will pick up where you

347
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:04,719
left off on that because I think

348
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:06,640
understanding that the interaction of

349
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:11,170
security and business is incredibly

350
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:14,110
important and I was not newly working

351
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:15,939
when I came to InfoSec I had experience

352
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:19,090
in the world of software but what I

353
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:22,870
wasn't prepared for was how difficult it

354
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:24,970
was to make security a priority and so

355
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:26,940
that's where you have to be able to

356
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:30,550
engage with the business people to

357
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:32,080
educate them not harangue them and help

358
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,890
them understand why it has to be a

359
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,520
priority

360
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:38,850
because often it's not even today

361
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:42,520
surprisingly it's not so being able to

362
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:44,440
speak in business terms about something

363
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:46,120
you know somewhat technical you don't

364
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,340
have to go too deep but be able to

365
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:51,430
present facts and figures your figures

366
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:52,870
and help lay out the risks that the

367
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:54,189
business will understand so they

368
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:57,700
understand why they have to make it a

369
00:15:54,190 --> 00:16:00,220
priority that was a hard lesson to learn

370
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:04,080
and is still part of my job every day

371
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:06,790
today and it can be a battle every day

372
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:09,070
yeah and I agree with you I mean trying

373
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:10,689
to help you know our CISOs and the you

374
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:13,090
know Board of Directors and the very sea

375
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:14,950
levels and the clients we work with take

376
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:16,600
what the outputs of these different

377
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:17,890
technologies are giving and tying that

378
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,170
back to business which is very

379
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:22,090
challenging so you know whenever I came

380
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:24,430
into the industry you know it's a much

381
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:25,960
different than it is today but for me it

382
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:28,449
was relatively easy to pick up okay

383
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:30,130
firewall does this you know DLP does

384
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:32,170
that you know the actual functionality

385
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:33,850
of the spectrum of technology that's out

386
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:35,709
there but for me what would have been

387
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:39,100
very helpful back then as a young person

388
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:42,370
coming in is learning how each of those

389
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:44,170
technologies interplay with policies

390
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:46,300
procedures standards

391
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,860
what does compliance have to do with

392
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,229
that right what are some of the external

393
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:51,910
factors that are forcing the businesses

394
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:54,130
to make decisions that aren't

395
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:56,410
necessarily based in either a technology

396
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:57,850
or functionality so and again that's

397
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:59,439
that's one of those areas that's still

398
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,210
kind of always evolving and want to try

399
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,170
and stay in front of but I think that

400
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:03,280
would have been the most helpful if

401
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:04,690
somebody would have set me down said

402
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,790
okay here's technology but here at how

403
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,950
it all works with the business that took

404
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:11,280
me a long time just kind of

405
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:14,790
out on my own I'll throw the set to

406
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:16,770
anybody that wants to jump at it when

407
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:17,909
somebody doesn't really have a technical

408
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:19,139
background and they're moving into

409
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:20,730
something like intersect which is a

410
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,530
technical field it can probably be a

411
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:24,450
little bit scary like I'm going to be

412
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:26,609
intimidated by all those engineers and

413
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:28,710
tech people how much of that do you

414
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:30,899
think is a real concern and how much of

415
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:32,130
that do you think you probably how much

416
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,620
text do you think you should know

417
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:38,640
especially if you're not exactly in an

418
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:41,459
engineering kind of role I'll take that

419
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,290
one to start so you know I'm definitely

420
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,330
not technical my wife actually jokes

421
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:46,680
that she's the helpdesk of our house and

422
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:48,570
I can't figure out how to work more you

423
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:50,820
know the iPad half the time right so but

424
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:52,050
when it comes to understanding the basic

425
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,669
functionality the various technologies

426
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:55,169
out there I do understand X I've been

427
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:58,200
living in it for ten years you know I

428
00:17:55,170 --> 00:18:00,900
see it every day so you know I think I

429
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,550
think it's okay to not be the subject

430
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,530
matter expert and everything but as long

431
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:06,510
as you know the basics of how something

432
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:08,430
operates or how technology operates or

433
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:11,790
how maybe to technologies you know

434
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:13,440
interplay against one another you know I

435
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:15,389
think to come in and not have that

436
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,830
expertise is okay you don't need to be

437
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:18,510
the expert but as long as you have a

438
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:21,810
basic understanding I think that that's

439
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:26,160
at least to start and to add on to that

440
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:28,560
having a sense of curiosity and being

441
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,210
willing to ask questions is important

442
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:33,870
and also having a little bit of humility

443
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:35,370
so I I'm a I have a pretty good

444
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:37,560
technical understanding I'm not a

445
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:40,169
hands-on technician and haven't ever

446
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:43,169
been in my career but I work with some

447
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:46,590
incredibly smart people and they like to

448
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:48,450
teach and they like to share and as long

449
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:50,040
as you're willing to be honest about

450
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:51,570
what you know and you don't know and you

451
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:54,510
don't try and act like something you're

452
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:56,010
not people are going to respect the fact

453
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:59,340
that you want to learn and you want to

454
00:18:56,010 --> 00:19:00,780
grow and as a most of my career I'm good

455
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:02,459
a program manager which means I'm

456
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:04,740
responsible for coordinating a lot of

457
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:06,390
people to solve problems and deliver

458
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:09,450
things so I have to know the right

459
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:11,190
questions to ask but generally what I do

460
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:13,020
is find out what kind of skills are

461
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:14,370
needed and I find those experts and I

462
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,350
bring them in and I get out of the way

463
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:19,169
so you just have to be willing to

464
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:20,459
understand the context and then bring in

465
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:22,350
the experts and then

466
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:29,520
opportunity to let them be the experts

467
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:32,070
and then learn from them yeah I think

468
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:35,940
Susan hit it on the head in terms of

469
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:38,129
being okay to ask questions and I know

470
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:39,630
there are probably jerks in every

471
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:41,250
industry but there are going to be still

472
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:42,360
some of the engineers and some of the

473
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:44,280
technical people that are more than

474
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,540
happy to explain things if somebody

475
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,460
comes to me and says hey how does this

476
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:49,110
kind of thing work or in your report

477
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:51,480
this week it you talked about this how

478
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:52,379
exactly can you just my own interests I

479
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,820
want to learn how this kind of thing

480
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,770
works you might explain it to me I'd

481
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:57,659
love to sure go ahead and ask these

482
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:59,100
people especially at a conference like

483
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:01,080
this where you heard Jack earlier

484
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,850
talking about it's all about community

485
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,439
it's all about communication talking to

486
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:06,060
people and if you have these kind of

487
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,470
interests even if you don't have the

488
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:09,120
background even if it's not part of your

489
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:11,550
job but you want to learn and you're

490
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,229
curious ask people love to talk about

491
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:16,800
this kind of stuff it's asking a whole

492
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:18,360
lot of fun what tips would you give

493
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,129
someone else that doesn't have an

494
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:22,139
engineering background that wants to get

495
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:24,110
in they maybe they have some other kind

496
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:26,010
of background currently and they think

497
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:27,449
information security things seems like

498
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:30,270
it's going to be a big deal someday I

499
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:35,160
want to get into it let's see rachel e

500
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:38,340
going to start so I think the most

501
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:39,900
helpful things for me starting when I

502
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:43,310
first started out and still to this day

503
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:45,570
are I mean there's so many like going to

504
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:48,270
events like if you're here right now

505
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:51,210
like that's a great start b-sides in

506
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:53,400
like the like show me cons and the hugh

507
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:55,730
set cons and like all of those little

508
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:58,140
hacker cons are incredibly helpful

509
00:20:55,730 --> 00:21:03,320
attending all of those sessions and

510
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:06,480
panels i think reading about security in

511
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:08,460
the mainstream news is helpful in a way

512
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:13,680
but also making sure that you're reading

513
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:16,050
like krebs and you know whatever your

514
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:21,840
your flavor is dark reading whatever it

515
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:24,960
may be but listening to people and how

516
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,610
they talk about security and I don't

517
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,200
know that like everyone might not have

518
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:29,740
an opportunity to like work in like a

519
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,080
tradeshow booth it some

520
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:34,420
eh but I've worked in many tradeshow

521
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:37,919
booths for different companies at like

522
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:40,120
blackhat and RSA and sans events and

523
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,710
people coming up to the booth and you

524
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:44,379
know what do you guys do you've given

525
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:46,240
that your spiel but then hearing the

526
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:47,890
kinds of questions that they ask like

527
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,620
what immediately comes to their mind

528
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:53,650
what's important to them going back to

529
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:57,850
the business case thing is probably the

530
00:21:53,650 --> 00:22:00,790
most insightful experiences I've had and

531
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:03,040
has helped me I think do my job better

532
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:05,670
is actually speaking to people that are

533
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:08,320
subject matter experts and figuring out

534
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:10,210
what's on their mind and if you aren't

535
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,678
at a trade show then obviously there's

536
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:14,410
tons of reading materials and tons and

537
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:18,700
tons of vlogs Swift on security you know

538
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:20,920
always a good place yeah so the other

539
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:22,870
thing to keep in mind is you can work in

540
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,850
information security without being a

541
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:27,760
security engineer or software engineer

542
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:30,699
or hardware engineer or a pen tester I

543
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,890
work at a security company but it's

544
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:35,160
still a company and it has lots of jobs

545
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:38,530
that are not about being an engineer

546
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:41,590
marketing people get to be intertwined

547
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:43,389
with security they need to understand it

548
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:45,189
and be able to communicate about it but

549
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:48,490
they love marketing so they do marketing

550
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:50,380
we still have finance people you know so

551
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:53,200
you can be involved in the industry

552
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:55,660
without being an engineer so it's figure

553
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,820
out what you like to do and then if it's

554
00:22:55,660 --> 00:23:00,220
not an engineering function but you're

555
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:01,510
interested in security find a company

556
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,890
that's looking for the stuff that you

557
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:04,570
like to do in the corporate world and

558
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:06,130
then you can be involved and then you

559
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:07,870
can learn more and if you want to take

560
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:09,700
another path once you get in most

561
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:13,439
companies are willing to let you learn

562
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:13,440
and have opportunities to try stuff out

563
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:19,690
yeah so I think you know what they both

564
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:21,729
said is very relevant I think to coming

565
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:23,890
in you know you have to be humble right

566
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:25,960
it's been said before we have to be ok

567
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:27,940
with asking questions and I think most

568
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,800
importantly have to be ok when somebody

569
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:31,179
asks you something and you don't know

570
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,740
the answer to say hey I don't know the

571
00:23:31,179 --> 00:23:34,840
answer to that that's okay not to know I

572
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:38,800
mean there's a lot of stuff out there to

573
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:40,300
really understand and learn so you know

574
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,800
as a young sales rep starting the other

575
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,300
7

576
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,220
times where I tried to kind of BS my way

577
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,750
through answers or whatever and it

578
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,850
always ended poorly so you know I

579
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:49,020
learned that very quickly that don't be

580
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:50,459
afraid to ask questions and they'll be

581
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:53,070
afraid to say hey I don't know but I do

582
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:55,500
know where I get that answer for you and

583
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:56,550
- coming from the sales side you know

584
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,920
kind of echo what Susan was saying

585
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:59,970
there's lots of entry-level sales jobs

586
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,800
whether that's working in bleed

587
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:04,080
generation or you know just an

588
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,629
entry-level inside sales role where that

589
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,429
really gives you a lot of experience and

590
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:10,200
exposure to you know whether that's a

591
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:12,120
specific technology or a services

592
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,620
business or whatever so I think that

593
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,780
that might be a really good foot in the

594
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:17,370
door and then you know you can go in

595
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,629
there and pivot and if you like what you

596
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:20,790
do or you see something that you really

597
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:22,080
want to you're interested in you know

598
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:23,670
start focusing on that after you have a

599
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,070
couple years of kind of industry

600
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:27,420
experience under your belt I actually

601
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:30,090
have a really good example of a

602
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:31,920
colleague who's actually about to become

603
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:35,250
an ex-colleague because he's moving on

604
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:39,860
he was selling insurance three years ago

605
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:42,960
he came to ver code in a entry-level

606
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:44,820
sales like lead generation or something

607
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,830
so I'm kind of role like that did that

608
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:48,480
for less than a year came over to

609
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:50,580
program management and learned about

610
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,980
program management was an associate for

611
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:54,270
less than e'er moved into product

612
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:56,130
management because he wanted to learn

613
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:57,990
about how products get developed and

614
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:59,640
that was his ultimate goal he was in

615
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:01,920
product management for a year and he

616
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:04,350
just took a much bigger role in product

617
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:06,900
management and another company so from

618
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:10,459
insurance to software security product

619
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:12,660
management in under three years

620
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:17,520
joining there any tips that today you'd

621
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:19,590
give yourself two months ago honestly I

622
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,570
think one of the most important things

623
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:23,550
that you can sort of show in the

624
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:25,649
industry and one of the most important

625
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:28,740
tools you can have is just a baseline

626
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:30,990
interest if you're here you're probably

627
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:34,860
interested in security at least I hope

628
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:36,990
you are but if you can show in an

629
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:39,030
interview or you can show when you're

630
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:40,710
talking to somebody in the industry that

631
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:43,710
it's something you really care about or

632
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:46,530
something that really sort of makes your

633
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:49,950
mind work I think that's really

634
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:52,950
important and then as a result of that

635
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:54,539
interest those you know important

636
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:57,570
questions that you'll have to ask

637
00:25:54,539 --> 00:25:59,369
we'll come naturally to you you know

638
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:01,859
you'll you'll feel more inclined to

639
00:25:59,369 --> 00:26:04,889
approach those people and figure things

640
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:06,599
out when you know security is something

641
00:26:04,889 --> 00:26:08,609
that you really care about no matter

642
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:14,129
what the reason is behind that so

643
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:16,408
passion exactly the dreaded word and I

644
00:26:14,129 --> 00:26:18,359
have another example kind of to go if

645
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:19,289
you're someone who's actually here and I

646
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:21,418
told her I was like I'm probably going

647
00:26:19,289 --> 00:26:23,099
to use it as an example but someone I

648
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:25,940
really look up to who's really like

649
00:26:23,099 --> 00:26:29,099
paved Rome path she started off in PR

650
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:31,199
working for an agency and then came in

651
00:26:29,099 --> 00:26:32,689
house for one of her clients which was

652
00:26:31,199 --> 00:26:36,509
core security she's snoozing right now

653
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:39,209
and she was just our you know she was

654
00:26:36,509 --> 00:26:41,609
our PR and social media person but she

655
00:26:39,209 --> 00:26:43,169
would spend so many hours sitting with

656
00:26:41,609 --> 00:26:46,228
our security team and our technical team

657
00:26:43,169 --> 00:26:48,989
product team trying she would write her

658
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:50,969
blog and just getting as much

659
00:26:48,989 --> 00:26:54,779
information as she could she was is

660
00:26:50,969 --> 00:26:56,549
luckily she's very smart too but what

661
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:59,909
three four years later now she's on the

662
00:26:56,549 --> 00:27:09,469
security team at rapid7 so it's key to

663
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:09,469
do yes I embarrassed her okay that's it

664
00:27:11,569 --> 00:27:16,349
all right so how about did you intend to

665
00:27:13,979 --> 00:27:19,019
work in InfoSec or to fall into it and

666
00:27:16,349 --> 00:27:21,029
how one of the first NIC sure yeah no

667
00:27:19,019 --> 00:27:23,669
absolutely I had no intention of going

668
00:27:21,029 --> 00:27:25,679
into InfoSec actually had some friends

669
00:27:23,669 --> 00:27:26,819
that worked at the company I start with

670
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:30,329
sufficient net security was a

671
00:27:26,819 --> 00:27:31,769
predecessor company to Optive and his

672
00:27:30,329 --> 00:27:34,799
base in Kansas City which is where I'm

673
00:27:31,769 --> 00:27:35,789
from the manager gig was a grind you

674
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,839
know I was working like 80 hours a week

675
00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:38,789
and I was trying to throw out what I

676
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:40,408
wanted to do really and I had a couple

677
00:27:38,789 --> 00:27:42,089
buddies over inside seals hey come check

678
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:43,529
it out so I started looking into him

679
00:27:42,089 --> 00:27:45,869
like you know what this is this is maybe

680
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:47,639
really interesting right and you know

681
00:27:45,869 --> 00:27:49,769
now I've relocated my family to the East

682
00:27:47,639 --> 00:27:52,379
Coast a while ago and made a very nice

683
00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:53,879
career out of it so didn't intend in

684
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:59,069
doing it but very happy that I landed

685
00:27:53,879 --> 00:28:01,678
here for sure yeah I can sort of concur

686
00:27:59,069 --> 00:28:04,349
with that I definitely didn't intend

687
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:06,390
information security I knew I was

688
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:11,340
interested in tech but

689
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:14,190
as far as I guess falling into it I it

690
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:16,740
was a very you know I guess regular

691
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:19,860
process I just I sort of applied for

692
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:21,780
jobs I I got a interview with rapid7 and

693
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:23,159
as soon as I interviewed at the company

694
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:24,750
that's when I knew I wanted to work

695
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,580
there because there were so many of

696
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:28,680
those questions that I wanted to ask in

697
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:30,449
the interview it was a two-hour long

698
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:35,100
interview and I feel like that wasn't

699
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:36,960
enough time so again the that interest

700
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:39,990
those questions that you'll ask are I

701
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:43,410
think are integral and sort of falling

702
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:45,570
into the industry yeah

703
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:50,280
no intention at all I moved to Boston

704
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:52,350
six years ago and I had been working in

705
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:55,399
the world for two years and luckily had

706
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:58,459
a foundation of marketing knowledge so

707
00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:00,810
signed up with like a temp agency and

708
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:03,240
three weeks after moving to Boston they

709
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:06,560
threw me into this company called ssh

710
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:08,760
communications security and bases a

711
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:10,080
temporary position to work as a

712
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:13,020
marketing coordinator to help with trade

713
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,850
shows and emails and just general

714
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:18,780
marketing stuff that i had some ability

715
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:20,250
in and i went to my first like security

716
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:25,740
conference i think he was like InfoSec

717
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:27,810
in Orlando Florida and I was like hooked

718
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:30,390
after that because I like walked into

719
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:33,090
the trade show floor and I was like what

720
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:35,360
are all these people and I was didn't

721
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:38,760
know what any of the companies did and

722
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:40,439
it was so interesting I would just spent

723
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,000
the day like walking around and I mean I

724
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,560
worked I was like in the booth but you

725
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,810
know on my breaks I would like walk

726
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:47,490
around and like you would like check out

727
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:49,590
all the messaging and like go and talk

728
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:52,650
to different vendors about what they did

729
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:55,879
and and then after that I started

730
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:58,500
noticing like I would start actually

731
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:00,030
noticing stories about data breaches in

732
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:03,030
the news because like before I was like

733
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:06,240
anchor but then I started getting very

734
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:07,649
interesting that so it been two

735
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,810
companies later I'm still in it and I've

736
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:12,150
planned to be in cybersecurity for

737
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:14,820
hopefully the rest of my career because

738
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:17,550
I think it's the most important industry

739
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:19,290
out there but security conferences do

740
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:19,639
have the best swag though yeah they have

741
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:24,350
pretty

742
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:26,540
Schlag so I didn't have the intent to

743
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:29,030
work in it because I've been working

744
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:34,220
long enough that it didn't exist when I

745
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:36,110
started working so I didn't work in

746
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:39,500
anything technical for the first couple

747
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:43,610
of jobs and then I got into software

748
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:46,160
project management and I think I talked

749
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:49,580
about this a little bit already I spent

750
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:51,500
many years doing that and when one of

751
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:55,370
the products that was in my portfolio to

752
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:58,610
manage had a vulnerability I got very

753
00:30:55,370 --> 00:31:01,250
interested in the process of finding it

754
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:03,229
and remediating it and resolving it and

755
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:05,810
the process that went along with all of

756
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:07,610
that and was lucky enough to be offered

757
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:11,270
an opportunity to move in that direction

758
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:13,159
just because just by happenstance so it

759
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:15,470
was I guess we make it four out of four

760
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:17,360
or five out of five not salutely kind of

761
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:19,880
us intended to do this and look at where

762
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:22,490
we are because I can relate to what

763
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:26,090
Susan said it didn't exist wait anyway

764
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:27,620
next question Oh what skills do you

765
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:31,370
think are important to you being

766
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:35,870
successful in your job Susan you're

767
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:41,379
still thinking so so I think this

768
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:45,260
applies to any job ability to listen and

769
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:48,020
communicate effectively is important to

770
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:49,879
any role because unless you are sitting

771
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:51,800
in a room by yourself working for

772
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:55,730
yourself and never dealing with another

773
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:59,210
human being generally every problem that

774
00:31:55,730 --> 00:32:01,760
I see happen is not because a product

775
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:04,910
fails or because somebody didn't do

776
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:07,129
their job or somebody intended to do

777
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:09,620
something harmful it comes with missed

778
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:12,160
expectations and miscommunication so

779
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:15,379
being able to communicate effectively is

780
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:18,050
both in person or communicating verbally

781
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:19,460
as well as in writing and that's

782
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:21,260
actually becoming more of a challenge

783
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:23,450
these days and I apologize for being

784
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:25,730
generational but people who are used to

785
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:29,780
typing you know a couple characters in a

786
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:32,930
text and abbreviating things having good

787
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:33,440
writing skills and being able to address

788
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:36,950
a

789
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:41,169
professional email effectively stands

790
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:43,789
out so much it seems very basic but

791
00:32:41,169 --> 00:32:47,629
those are things that get noticed I

792
00:32:43,789 --> 00:32:49,809
think you just made Jordans day yes yes

793
00:32:47,629 --> 00:32:49,809
you did

794
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:55,580
so for my job specifically so I'm a

795
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,889
marketing manager I have a very

796
00:32:55,580 --> 00:33:01,309
difficult job along with salespeople

797
00:32:57,889 --> 00:33:04,309
because selling and marketing to info

798
00:33:01,309 --> 00:33:07,370
security people is challenging because

799
00:33:04,309 --> 00:33:09,590
they are like no BS people they will see

800
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:12,739
right through you you can't like do the

801
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:14,600
like HubSpot e like ten things that will

802
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:16,850
clean up your security environment and

803
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:23,809
like and like though they'll be like now

804
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:27,590
so for me going off but soon soon was

805
00:33:23,809 --> 00:33:30,740
saying having good interpersonal skills

806
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:32,928
and being able to be open to asking

807
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:35,450
questions and learning more and general

808
00:33:32,929 --> 00:33:36,889
curiosity and understanding that you do

809
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:38,720
not know best you need to go to the

810
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:41,629
people that know best fortunately for me

811
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:44,059
I am surrounded by the people that I try

812
00:33:41,629 --> 00:33:45,889
and market and sell to so we have a

813
00:33:44,059 --> 00:33:49,519
security operation center in our office

814
00:33:45,889 --> 00:33:51,769
I go in there numerous times a day one

815
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:54,679
of our soft members is here and I'll go

816
00:33:51,769 --> 00:33:57,649
in and I'll be like can you read this

817
00:33:54,679 --> 00:33:59,419
what do you think about this like what

818
00:33:57,649 --> 00:34:02,870
would you think if you got this in the

819
00:33:59,419 --> 00:34:05,409
mail from us and it's incredibly helpful

820
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:07,789
I mean they're sometimes too honest

821
00:34:05,409 --> 00:34:10,609
they'll be like that's so stupid

822
00:34:07,789 --> 00:34:12,050
and like I wanted to like be like oh

823
00:34:10,609 --> 00:34:14,328
like maybe we should do like a giveaway

824
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,679
like a nest camera and they were like

825
00:34:14,329 --> 00:34:18,740
are you kidding me you can't give like

826
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:23,810
security people cameras like I was like

827
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:26,899
oh yeah I was like I a good plane so

828
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:28,429
it's really helpful to be surrounded by

829
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:31,069
the people that I'm trying to market and

830
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:33,889
sell to and it's really just um being

831
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:35,659
humble and not trying to like trick them

832
00:34:33,889 --> 00:34:39,649
because they will see right through you

833
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:41,629
um yeah and see yeah works for a company

834
00:34:39,649 --> 00:34:43,190
once it gave away USB keys said it yeah

835
00:34:41,629 --> 00:34:44,259
yeah that's another one that I shouldn't

836
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:50,260
give away

837
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:52,540
can see this piece so take it from the

838
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:55,480
tech writer attention to detail is

839
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:57,160
important in almost any job field I

840
00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:02,590
think but especially in information

841
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:04,899
security whether the you know actually

842
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:10,000
testing vulnerabilities or reporting

843
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:14,740
them everything hinges on you know very

844
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:17,020
minor inconsistencies or you know areas

845
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:19,419
where you sort of have to go in with a

846
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:24,280
microscope to really find what's wrong

847
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:25,990
with something so being able to to look

848
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:29,130
at something critically and sort of

849
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:33,100
break it down into pieces and I guess

850
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:35,170
digress in a productive way is very

851
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:38,368
important when it comes to this field

852
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:41,830
and I'd also like to point out that

853
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:44,500
being disruptive finding ways to

854
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:47,799
innovate is really something that is

855
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:49,810
helpful not only when you're trying to

856
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:52,660
get into the field but once you're in it

857
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:55,119
as well because this is a field that's

858
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:58,270
constantly evolving and it's a field

859
00:35:55,119 --> 00:36:00,630
that needs people to you know come up

860
00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:05,350
with new ideas new processes for things

861
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:08,830
just new ways of doing stuff because if

862
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:12,368
we don't come up with things new things

863
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:16,259
to do we'll eventually stagnate and fall

864
00:36:12,369 --> 00:36:18,730
behind whoever the competition might be

865
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:19,960
so being the last one respondents

866
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:20,530
afforded me the luxury to think about

867
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,119
this for a minute

868
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:24,310
so there's several skills that I think

869
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:26,050
are very important to my job again

870
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:29,320
tempered through the sales lens right so

871
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:31,390
the first one is be relevant and what do

872
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:33,970
I mean by that so you know I'm

873
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:36,850
constantly emailing and calling seaso

874
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:38,859
CIO Senior Director CTOs you know across

875
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:40,810
organizations that I'm prospecting into

876
00:36:38,859 --> 00:36:42,130
and I always try to put myself into

877
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:44,710
their shoes and think about how many

878
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:46,869
emails that they get in a day hundreds

879
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:48,520
if not thousands right customer from

880
00:36:46,869 --> 00:36:51,060
guys like me trying to get a you know

881
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:53,230
meeting or a follow up or whatever so

882
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:55,779
you know I found to be very successful

883
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:57,040
in I apply this everywhere but be

884
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,090
relevant and to the point

885
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,680
I never seen an email

886
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:01,540
especially introductory email or an

887
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:04,600
unsolicited email more than about two or

888
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:05,710
three sentences you know if you don't

889
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:08,350
have somebody's attention within the

890
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:12,300
first couple words you're in here in the

891
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:15,370
the trash box so be relevant be concise

892
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:17,700
another very important skill to Susan's

893
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:20,500
point is communication skills

894
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:23,109
specifically the ability to listen and

895
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:25,450
I'll give a kind of anecdotal example so

896
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:28,540
just about a month ago I was attending

897
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:31,839
the Boston secure world conference down

898
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:34,000
at the Heinz Center and I observed kind

899
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:37,090
of from a from aside an interaction

900
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,280
between sales rep and then a individual

901
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:40,870
from a very large organization based in

902
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:44,710
Boston that everybody in this room would

903
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:45,910
recognize her name so the the person

904
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:48,340
from this company came up and started

905
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:49,870
asking questions sales rep got real

906
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:51,010
excited because they saw the big names

907
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:54,009
like oh wow we're going to really

908
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:57,520
impress this guy and he started just

909
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:59,830
talking and talking talking the person

910
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,509
from the customer was trying to

911
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:04,120
interject you trying to share his

912
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:05,860
problems he was asking questions but the

913
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:07,480
sales rep was just going going going it

914
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,900
wasn't even taken one second to listen

915
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:10,930
to this guy

916
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:12,280
so a few minutes went by the guy kind of

917
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:15,339
threw up his hands and walked away right

918
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:17,560
and I think did that sales rep had they

919
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:19,030
just taken a minute to stop and listen

920
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:21,610
and really hear and understand what this

921
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:23,710
you know fairly high-ranking person from

922
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:24,910
this company was trying to say he most

923
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:26,350
definitely would have at least led to a

924
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:27,910
follow-up meeting it's not a sale but

925
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:29,580
now you know good luck selling to that

926
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:31,569
guy anytime in the next couple years so

927
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:33,009
listening is very very important

928
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:36,040
communication skills for sure

929
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:37,720
yeah and that's awesome and I would add

930
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,370
on to that and you guys can throw

931
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:41,220
tomatoes at me if you want because I'm

932
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:43,779
going to throw out a very fuzzy one but

933
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:45,730
situational awareness so that's a

934
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:48,640
perfect example of the person had their

935
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:51,070
own agenda the sales person there had

936
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:53,140
their own agenda and rather than opening

937
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:56,020
themselves up to what someone was

938
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:58,359
wanting to bring to them to ask for

939
00:38:56,020 --> 00:39:01,740
their help on he was just doing his own

940
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:04,750
thing so you have to be able to read the

941
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:06,970
unspoken messages pay attention to the

942
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:08,860
dynamics of the people in the room one

943
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:11,049
of the one of the best things somebody

944
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:11,950
where told me is them especially now

945
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:14,170
with where everybody

946
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:16,689
has maybe three devices sometimes

947
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:19,420
they're carrying especially if you're

948
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:21,850
trying to get somebody on your side or

949
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:23,470
pitch something or get a project

950
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:26,170
approved or get funding for something

951
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:29,049
the moment one of the decision-makers

952
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:31,090
picks up their device you've lost them

953
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:33,160
so you have to keep them engaged and

954
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:34,930
sometimes you can get them back but

955
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:36,850
paying attention to the nonverbal cues

956
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:40,000
that are going on in the room and

957
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:42,100
sometimes other people in whatever

958
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,250
situation you're in are communicating

959
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:47,110
between themselves non-verbally and so

960
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:49,450
it's not an easy skill to develop and

961
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:55,030
it's not innate and everybody but it's

962
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:55,990
really really important I thought this

963
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:58,420
let's see

964
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:59,979
that's last question that I have might

965
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:01,360
be just kind of fun but something

966
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:05,770
technical you've learned on the job that

967
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:07,330
you didn't know when you started I'm

968
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:11,980
going to go first because I feel like I

969
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:13,480
don't want anyone to take mine I thought

970
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:18,400
about this for luckily I saw this to

971
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:19,630
answer I'm in question so I mean there's

972
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,030
tons of stuff that I've learned like

973
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:24,430
learning that like people can hack your

974
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:25,540
like camera on your laptop and like

975
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:27,040
little stuff like all the different

976
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:29,740
types of IOT things that can be hacked

977
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:32,850
so that's all like very interesting and

978
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:37,270
scary to learn about but something

979
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:40,210
pretty scary is the is Philo's malware

980
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:43,030
and when I first heard that I had no

981
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:46,570
idea what that meant but I think

982
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:50,380
learning about like utilizing PowerShell

983
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:52,920
and WMI to basically control an OS

984
00:40:50,380 --> 00:41:03,150
without actually installing any software

985
00:40:52,920 --> 00:41:05,470
is pretty trippy trippy was the word I

986
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:07,930
would say probably one of the coolest

987
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:11,140
things I've gotten to do has nothing to

988
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:12,850
do with any work that I've done but I

989
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:15,520
showed an interest in something and

990
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:18,819
previous employer was kind enough to

991
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:23,710
fund me to take a digital forensics

992
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:25,740
class and that was pretty darn cool and

993
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:27,660
it was a struggle for me

994
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:30,689
it was highly technical but I had a

995
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:32,700
colleague who helped me through it and I

996
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:38,940
learned a ton and I learned some really

997
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:41,240
scary stuff so I guess the thing that I

998
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:46,500
wanted to point out is not really

999
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:49,589
pertinent to cybersecurity per se but at

1000
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:51,450
the hackathon Patrick mentioned one of

1001
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:53,369
the consultants actually taught me how

1002
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:57,118
to pick a lock which I thought was very

1003
00:41:53,369 --> 00:42:00,390
interesting it's it's a lot of fun and

1004
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:03,450
it's actually a lot like hacking in sort

1005
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:06,180
of a high-level sense it's breaking

1006
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:08,580
something down into pieces identifying

1007
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:11,460
the safeties and then bypassing them one

1008
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:13,470
by one so I've learned a tremendous

1009
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:15,240
amount of technical you know information

1010
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:17,299
that I didn't know coming into it but

1011
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:19,500
some of the things that really stand out

1012
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:22,590
you know not that long ago I

1013
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:24,030
participated in a presentation of

1014
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:26,369
findings where we did a very large

1015
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:29,730
corporate wide penetration test for a

1016
00:42:26,369 --> 00:42:31,200
fortune 100 company and you know there

1017
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:33,480
was a several month effort with multiple

1018
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:36,149
resources and crops the world doing all

1019
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:38,430
sorts of pen testing and it ranged from

1020
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:39,750
you know app scanning all the way down

1021
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:42,830
to social engineering and you know

1022
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:46,200
physical security penetration testing so

1023
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:47,609
to see the the results of that you know

1024
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:50,160
the ways that these guys were actually

1025
00:42:47,609 --> 00:42:52,770
able to gain entrance into secured

1026
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:54,450
buildings and go around and just the the

1027
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:57,960
information you know whether that be

1028
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:59,100
printed files or just open ports or

1029
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:01,260
conference rooms with the you know

1030
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:03,720
computer in it that's unlocked you know

1031
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:05,790
this you know large ports 100 highly

1032
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:08,040
regulated secure company was just

1033
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:10,170
astounding the way the way that that are

1034
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:12,210
you know ethical hackers were able to go

1035
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:13,890
in and do that really blew me away I

1036
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:15,869
mean it was and this was only a few

1037
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:17,730
months ago that you know I said in on

1038
00:43:15,869 --> 00:43:19,590
this so very cool to see the way that

1039
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:21,480
they do that I mean it just as a side

1040
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:22,890
note we have one guy crawling through

1041
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,300
duct work to try to get into somebody

1042
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:26,879
data center one time and you fell

1043
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:29,130
through the ceiling so you know the

1044
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,930
extent that you know not only our guys

1045
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:32,880
will do but also the bad guys will do to

1046
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:37,190
go in and get somewhere it's just really

1047
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:37,190
really very revealing so

1048
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:42,940
so we probably have time for one

1049
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:44,770
question ish from the audience's anybody

1050
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:46,540
think of one while we were going through

1051
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:54,310
this that they want either the whole

1052
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:55,900
panel or one person answer so I've been

1053
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:58,570
more of a technical myself more of an

1054
00:43:55,900 --> 00:44:00,670
engineer but kind of just curious is

1055
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:02,620
there anything feedback you guys could

1056
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:05,500
give I guess to more technical people or

1057
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:09,450
like criticisms or tips I guess to help

1058
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:09,450
you guys be more effective in your job I

1059
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:21,540
don't know if I've ever told an engineer

1060
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:25,240
what to do where you can I just keep

1061
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:28,600
helping everyone else out and in like

1062
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:31,089
the information sharing manner and I

1063
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:35,790
think like I said attending meetups and

1064
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:39,550
b-sides and hacker cons and

1065
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:41,920
capture-the-flag type things networking

1066
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:44,470
I think I mean I can't help you in any

1067
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:48,160
way but like probably like other people

1068
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:49,899
here can just like saying hello maybe

1069
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:52,089
patience with those of us who are less

1070
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:53,950
technical than you especially those who

1071
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:56,590
are expressing interests and curiosity

1072
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:58,180
and want to learn and might things need

1073
00:44:56,590 --> 00:45:02,770
things explained to them more than once

1074
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:07,330
so people aren't trying to bother you

1075
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:09,690
I generally really want your help there

1076
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:09,690
any others

1077
00:45:11,890 --> 00:45:20,710
do your companies formally encourage

1078
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:20,710
additional education or certifications

1079
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:29,360
the short answer is yes I don't think

1080
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,810
certifications as much but I could be

1081
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:33,500
wrong

1082
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:34,070
mic certification yeah but yeah

1083
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:37,340
definitely

1084
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:39,440
I mean we sponsor a lot of kind of

1085
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:41,780
information-sharing gatherings and

1086
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:44,960
meetups because that's very important I

1087
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:46,790
mean I feel like that's how security has

1088
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,650
evolved is from everyone sharing

1089
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:50,090
knowledge about look at this piece of

1090
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:53,090
malware I found and look at this thing

1091
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:55,610
that I discovered in sharing research

1092
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:57,560
and so I think it's very important

1093
00:45:55,610 --> 00:45:58,940
yeah and that's actually I'm glad you

1094
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:00,770
brought that up because there's a lot of

1095
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:03,770
certifications that are not necessarily

1096
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:07,730
engineering oriented you're CISSP Xin

1097
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:09,110
Jie sex and Gi at giac or certified

1098
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:11,360
ethical hacker and that kind of stuff

1099
00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:16,520
but there's other organizations that

1100
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:18,260
offer other more process and program

1101
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:19,670
level and management types of

1102
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:23,090
certifications that are still around

1103
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:25,850
this aisaka is one certified information

1104
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:32,900
security manager certified information

1105
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:34,220
risk something C risk sisa I don't even

1106
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:37,040
know what the acronyms are but I thought

1107
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:38,629
was a great one where you can be in the

1108
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:40,250
area of information assurance and

1109
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:42,860
information security but you don't have

1110
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:45,310
to be hands-on engineer I'm working on

1111
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:47,510
my CI SM right now my company is

1112
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:49,100
sponsoring me for that I got another I

1113
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:50,750
got a third-party risk management

1114
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:54,650
certification and they sponsored me for

1115
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:56,660
that and so yeah definitely one of the

1116
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:59,000
things that opted does is also sponsor

1117
00:46:56,660 --> 00:47:01,040
anybody interested in doing their CSP or

1118
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,870
any of those others but one of the lines

1119
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:04,400
of business that we we have is around

1120
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:06,259
training so we do a bunch of security

1121
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:08,300
awareness training you know hacker

1122
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:11,090
training and coding training but we also

1123
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:13,250
have a pretty large course book of

1124
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:15,680
technical training whether that's a you

1125
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:17,690
know be certified to be a f5 LTM

1126
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,980
administrator you know firewall I've

1127
00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:20,870
been expert or whatever there's a bunch

1128
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:22,760
of different classes and so they'll

1129
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:23,790
actually kind of task for it but they'll

1130
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:25,530
actually let

1131
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:27,690
employees sit in on those classes if we

1132
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:28,860
don't have a full session as long as

1133
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:31,380
it's convenient for the workload their

1134
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:32,670
manager approves it so you know so that

1135
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:34,140
gives them exposure if somebody wants to

1136
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:37,140
learn more about a specific technology

1137
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:42,060
or whatever so always continuing

1138
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:51,180
education that's for sure want to thank

1139
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:52,920
the panel for for doing this and thank

1140
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:53,850
all of you for coming and I'm guessing

1141
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:55,080
it could catch one of them out in the

1142
00:47:53,850 --> 00:47:56,880
hallway and your questions for them

1143
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:59,150
they'd probably be happy to answer that

1144
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,150
and
