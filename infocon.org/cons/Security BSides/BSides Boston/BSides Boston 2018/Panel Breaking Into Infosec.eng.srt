00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:08,068
Mexicans go left to right from the

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,880
actual presentation screen in terms of

4
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:11,370
who we have here

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,759

73
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:46,440
innovation is her jam to say the least

74
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:49,470
when she is not being able to guide a

75
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:52,230
guide up a mountain of information she

76
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:54,000
is studying hard and being a sponge to

77
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:56,369
absorb everything in InfoSec related

78
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,620
information she likes oesn't research

79
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:01,440
and two-factor authentication dislikes

80
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,550
bad passwords and sun-dried tomatoes so

81
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,370

88
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,230
so I am key tablet I'm an engineer the

89
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:21,450
customer success team at rapid7

90
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:24,450
I also recently co-founded the InfoSec

91
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:27,510
mentors project from HTTP colon slash

92
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:29,760
slash InfoSec mentors net with my

93
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:31,350
co-founder and good friend Jim Evo I'm

94
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,359
passionate about helping people learn

95
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:35,880
about security and information security

96
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,570
in joining the industry and I've

97
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:41,090
presented or created I should say a

98
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:42,750
series of questions for the panel

99
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:44,340
surrounding kind of three different

100
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,260
viewpoints one from the educators

101
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,820
viewpoint one from the viewpoint of

102
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,470
someone who is moving laterally into the

103
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,940
industry from a different role and of

104
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,840
course one from the management viewpoint

105
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,630
of the people that are actually doing

106
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,459
the hire so with that we're going to go

107
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:58,200
ahead and get started here so the first

108
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:00,480
question is going to be forming ciao

109
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,369
so from Ming question for you what have

110
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,079
you found to be the biggest challenge in

111
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:10,370
preparing students for the industry so I

112
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:14,580
want to ask how many of you here are in

113
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:17,970
energy who still a student how many are

114
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:24,870
okay so quite a few there's a good

115
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:25,830
amount here I think the what I find a

116
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,720
most difficult

117
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:29,219
the most difficult thing I find right

118
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,370
but are you going to be the biggest

119
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:34,919
challenge so yes challenges I think the

120
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:42,180
biggest challenge is I see a lot of

121
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:45,258
schools they they wait too late to get

122
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:48,270
students out of their comfort zone and

123
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:49,710
one of the things and I'm sure Justin

124
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:54,229
probably say a little bit more about

125
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:58,979
this is you know it's the idea that you

126
00:04:54,229 --> 00:05:00,750
know when you get into Industrial you

127
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:02,909
get your first internship a lot of

128
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:07,800
students were walking with like deer in

129
00:05:02,909 --> 00:05:09,210
the headlights I I hear a lot of to see

130
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,550
a lot of juniors when they get their

131
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:13,258
first internship and they write a write

132
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:16,409
to me at the end of the summer saying I

133
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:18,539
wish I got more instructions from I well

134
00:05:16,409 --> 00:05:22,020
I got more feedback and supervision and

135
00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:25,139
instruction from my supervisor and my

136
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:28,378
response is always this my response is

137
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:30,330
always welcome to reality because you'll

138
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:32,729
be lucky enough I mean in some courses

139
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:35,008
in an education you're given a

140
00:05:32,729 --> 00:05:36,599
specification you're given a

141
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:38,729
documentation on how to work on a

142
00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:43,080
problem sometimes it's even like eleven

143
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:45,479
pages long you also get you also get the

144
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,940
number of points that you will get you

145
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:50,699
know for checking off the boxes you're

146
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:53,339
not going to get that at a workplace and

147
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:54,990
that is a huge adjustment that a lot of

148
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:57,029
students that need to make is that

149
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:59,819
everyone has been so beaten so

150
00:05:57,029 --> 00:06:02,639
brainwashed so trained to here's the

151
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:04,139
instructions I hear the instructions

152
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,819
this is what you need to do these are

153
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:07,680
all the things that you need to get in

154
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:10,729
order to get an A it doesn't work like

155
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:16,379
that in the in the real world and

156
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:19,258
there's also a lack of opportunities I

157
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:22,020
see in which student work on open-ended

158
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:24,930
projects when you'll be lucky enough to

159
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:26,400
get a sentence about what to do I think

160
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:28,050
that's the biggest challenge of them all

161
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,489
is it get them out of that mindset and

162
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:34,680
say okay you know here's a pro here

163
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:37,050
here's a little cast for you here you

164
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,279
hear a few books go and do it I think

165
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,199
that's that's by far and away the

166
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:42,379
biggest challenge

167
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,659
I see yeah that's what was something

168
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:47,930
that I thought of as you're talking

169
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:52,810
about that is how looking back on my

170
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:55,279
college education I regret not joining

171
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:58,189
some of the other clubs like the

172
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:59,930
information assurance Club and other

173
00:06:58,189 --> 00:07:03,080
like offensive security clubs that

174
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:05,419
happen to be in school I was at and and

175
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,310
for people who might be in schools right

176
00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:08,659
now that don't have those clubs and

177
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:12,439
you're not comfortable trying to start

178
00:07:08,659 --> 00:07:15,080
something up like that leveraging the

179
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:17,150
local meetup community is huge

180
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,159
and again that's something to where I'm

181
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:22,339
not sure the school I went to Penn State

182
00:07:19,159 --> 00:07:24,069
had a meet up community because Penn

183
00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:28,249
State's kind of in the middle of nowhere

184
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:29,990
but those two things to try to using

185
00:07:28,249 --> 00:07:32,300
those two things to try to get over that

186
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:35,029
challenge is probably going to be hugely

187
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,560
important for people who are either in

188
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:39,860
academia and trying to get into the

189
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,089
community or if you're not in the I'm

190
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,349
sorry in the profession and if you're

191
00:07:41,089 --> 00:07:45,289
not in the profession and you're not in

192
00:07:42,349 --> 00:07:47,270
academia then those meetup communities

193
00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:49,128
are too huge and like InfoSec mentors

194
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:50,990
that's an example of something is that

195
00:07:49,129 --> 00:07:53,149
just for the area everybody it's

196
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:54,680
everywhere it's worldwide yeah sort of

197
00:07:53,149 --> 00:07:57,169
finding those groups of people who are

198
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:02,000
there to provide support for others to

199
00:07:57,169 --> 00:08:03,409
learn and join the profession is

200
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,110
actually a good opportunity as well for

201
00:08:03,409 --> 00:08:08,419
a question for Tracy so Tracy being that

202
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,560
you're a non-traditional move into the

203
00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:11,719
information security industry and you

204
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,639
certainly made a splash on Twitter and a

205
00:08:11,719 --> 00:08:15,319
lot of other things that you've done

206
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,430
speaking at other conferences what have

207
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:19,060
you found to be the biggest challenge

208
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:22,240
for entering into the industry laterally

209
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:26,449
the biggest challenge I faced was

210
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:28,249
talking to security pros and if I talked

211
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:33,529
to two security pros I'd get five

212
00:08:28,249 --> 00:08:35,659
opinions so there's a lot of varying

213
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:37,969
information and it's very confusing you

214
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:40,760
get people who will say to you you know

215
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:43,819
LS you know what what sort of should I

216
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:46,610
study you know in InfoSec and you'll get

217
00:08:43,818 --> 00:08:49,610
things like well you know we just get

218
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:51,430
assist paid okay well you know when you

219
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:53,520
say that to someone you're thinking

220
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:56,319
what is that you know if they're new

221
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,000
you'll get people who will say search

222
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,670
for everything you'll get people to say

223
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,450
search me nothing so there's just such a

224
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:06,790
wide range of information that is being

225
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:08,440
thrown at you or suggestions made at you

226
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:11,800
that it's very confusing and very

227
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:13,990
overwhelming and there were moments when

228
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,849
I was when I first started poking around

229
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:18,880
it was more just my quirky hobby I

230
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:20,950
wasn't really looking at it immediately

231
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,900
as a job change or an industry change

232
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:25,060
but I you know you would finally find

233
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:27,760
another new person to talk to and you

234
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:28,930
kind of swap stories and you know share

235
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,610
the same things that like everybody

236
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:33,400
keeps telling me this but then I keep

237
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:35,050
hearing this and I I know that there's

238
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:38,560
you know there's no way that we can herd

239
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:40,599
this whole sheep security pros to get on

240
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,810
one page but if you're dispensing

241
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:45,610
information be mindful of you know of

242
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:48,310
what you're saying and maybe even give

243
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:50,710
the asterisk of ok you make sure people

244
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:53,079
say this and that's why they'll tell you

245
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:55,030
that starts me nothing but it's just

246
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,910
kind of throwing things out there is

247
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:59,949
really a big challenge to get past in it

248
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:02,500
I finally kind of put it together in my

249
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:04,690
brain to get some background information

250
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:07,750
about the person who is dispensing that

251
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:11,560
information and that helped put that

252
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:13,000
those suggestions into a framework that

253
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,160
I could understand their motivation for

254
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,290
saying it and then either you know

255
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,480
accepted it or disregarded it based on

256
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:21,160
you know what I wanted to do so that was

257
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,140
really the biggest challenge was sifting

258
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:25,150
the wheat from the chaff so to speak of

259
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:27,460
you know understanding the information

260
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:28,540
that people were telling you this is

261
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,160
actually a good opportunity as well

262
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,540
since Justin you are a hiring manager in

263
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,589
security I'd be curious to know what you

264
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,969
found to be the biggest challenge in

265
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:36,280
actually hiring for the industry in

266
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:38,650
terms of maybe looking for skill sets

267
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:44,550
looking for certifications education etc

268
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:46,689
yeah for us right now we're kind of

269
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:48,630
shifting our focus a little bit in terms

270
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:52,750
of skill sets we're looking for and

271
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:55,300
we're really looking for people who have

272
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:57,810
strong software engineering backgrounds

273
00:10:55,300 --> 00:11:03,699
or development backgrounds especially

274
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:04,878
within a broader context of working in

275
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,189
some other security

276
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:09,109
and it's hard enough as it is to find

277
00:11:07,189 --> 00:11:11,029
good security talent for both technical

278
00:11:09,109 --> 00:11:14,539
and non-technical roles but when you

279
00:11:11,029 --> 00:11:16,819
throw in basically another roles

280
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:20,839
skillset into the mix fully or partially

281
00:11:16,819 --> 00:11:22,689
it becomes even more challenging but for

282
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:26,660
people who are looking to break into

283
00:11:22,689 --> 00:11:28,399
InfoSec if you already have some

284
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:32,419
security certifications you have some

285
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:34,549
security knowledge and you really want

286
00:11:32,419 --> 00:11:37,129
to bolster your resume essentially I

287
00:11:34,549 --> 00:11:39,319
think software development skills are

288
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:45,529
going to become more and more important

289
00:11:39,319 --> 00:11:50,089
as trying to keep up with the latest

290
00:11:45,529 --> 00:11:52,189
threats and attacker trends requires the

291
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:54,679
you know automation of different

292
00:11:52,189 --> 00:11:56,988
security processes and there is that

293
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:58,699
huge skill shortage that people keep

294
00:11:56,989 --> 00:12:00,979
talking about you know they're going to

295
00:11:58,699 --> 00:12:03,199
be like one to one and a half million

296
00:12:00,979 --> 00:12:06,999
unfilled security positions around the

297
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:09,258
world by 2020 and it's like okay well

298
00:12:06,999 --> 00:12:11,089
let's assume we're not going to find all

299
00:12:09,259 --> 00:12:12,709
those people like we definitely haven't

300
00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:15,379
found them today so what's an

301
00:12:12,709 --> 00:12:19,219
alternative that can either help us fill

302
00:12:15,379 --> 00:12:21,079
that gap temporarily or permanently and

303
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:23,299
having those software development skills

304
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:25,248
to automate a lot of the manual work

305
00:12:23,299 --> 00:12:27,259
that we would otherwise need more humans

306
00:12:25,249 --> 00:12:28,970
to do is going to be hugely important

307
00:12:27,259 --> 00:12:30,919
it's actually a really great segue for

308
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:32,359
my next question which is for me what

309
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:35,779
skills are you encouraging students to

310
00:12:32,359 --> 00:12:37,519
focus on learning so what I've been

311
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:40,489
encouraging students should do are a

312
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:44,059
couple of things plastic like a bottle I

313
00:12:40,489 --> 00:12:47,769
encourage them did learn well I get a

314
00:12:44,059 --> 00:12:51,919
lot of criticism for doing this and

315
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:53,600
first and foremost I the most important

316
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:55,720
point in a lot of my courses the way I

317
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,220
structure them is learning how to learn

318
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:02,449
learning how to learn and the reason why

319
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:03,769
that's an important skill is look

320
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:06,439
there's going to be new stuff all the

321
00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:09,199
time there's going to be a lot of new

322
00:13:06,439 --> 00:13:11,719
technologies that are that are going to

323
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:13,819
be coming out you know every day and

324
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,920
it's going to be very and one of the

325
00:13:13,819 --> 00:13:20,319
things about technology is that move

326
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:23,029
very fast it moved very very fast so

327
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,980
yeah a lot of students criticize the

328
00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:27,529
fact that I have to you know a lot of my

329
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:31,639
assignments are kind of loosely vague

330
00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:33,620
and I let them you know in order to you

331
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:35,149
know get to what they need to accomplish

332
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:39,110
they got to look at things like Google

333
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:42,589
and Stack Overflow well yes and the

334
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:46,610
reason for that is look when I was a

335
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:49,209
student way back in the day 15 years ago

336
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:52,370
now I didn't take a course in web I

337
00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:54,018
didn't take a course in mobile I didn't

338
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:55,329
take a course in cybersecurity hack it

339
00:13:54,019 --> 00:13:59,540
didn't even exist

340
00:13:55,329 --> 00:14:01,609
so what did I have to do I learned from

341
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:03,920
people I learned from different

342
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:07,220
resources on typical odd of different

343
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:09,469
resources even as anyone a fan of

344
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:11,660
cooking here anyone a fan of cooking I

345
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:14,209
mean how you learn how to cook you learn

346
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:17,469
how to cook by you learn how to cook by

347
00:14:14,209 --> 00:14:20,599
watching YouTube videos the you to add

348
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:23,110
sometimes cookbooks from other people

349
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:26,540
same analogy same thing applies in in

350
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:30,320
technology same thing in this field the

351
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:33,589
other two things I stress you know and I

352
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,959
feel that we moved away from this over

353
00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:37,880
the last few years I think we forgotten

354
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:39,170
the basics I think we've forgotten how

355
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:41,870
to read and write properly in

356
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:43,430
communication skills and I'm sure Justin

357
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:44,600
you must have I mean I'm sure you and I

358
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:46,489
can't wrinkle with this and we can

359
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,100
complain a lot about this about how that

360
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:51,140
skill is give basically lacking if I had

361
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:53,870
my way I mean the other thing I wish I

362
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:55,310
would tell people which I don't do you

363
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:56,570
know an area I could ask you to tell

364
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:59,479
students to do yeah I take a course on

365
00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:02,180
public speaking again basic

366
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:04,339
communication skills so just to

367
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:05,810
summarize learning how to learn taking

368
00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:07,730
responsibility for your own learning and

369
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:09,819
the real basic skills are reading and

370
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:11,839
writing things in the last forever

371
00:15:09,819 --> 00:15:13,969
at that point about learning how to

372
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,130
learn is huge but it's hard because it's

373
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:19,100
easy to say well you just need to learn

374
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:22,579
how to learn more but that's such an

375
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:24,350
abstract thing like how you do that and

376
00:15:22,579 --> 00:15:26,729
I don't know all the ways you could

377
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:30,720
possibly teach yourself

378
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:32,760
how to learn better but I remember an

379
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,519
important part of my college education

380
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:37,319
was taking classes you know we had

381
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,959
electives but I focused on some

382
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:42,810
different categories of left electives

383
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:44,880
like philosophy classes and this helped

384
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:48,388
me but I remember it completely changed

385
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:50,160
the way I just thought in general you

386
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:51,899
know some intro to philosophy classes in

387
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,189
philosophy and logic and whatnot

388
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:58,620
but on top of that learning how to learn

389
00:15:55,190 --> 00:16:00,839
bolstering that abstract skill I think

390
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:03,959
can be done by just experimenting and

391
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:06,300
tinkering and just not tinkering blindly

392
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:10,079
but pick something small that you want

393
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:11,849
to learn about and just run through it

394
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,229
step by step and then break it down and

395
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:15,510
build it back up or build things from

396
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:17,220
scratch whether it's hardware software

397
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:19,529
or something like that and it's just

398
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:21,029
going to change how you approach solving

399
00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:22,560
new problems and it's something that

400
00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:24,389
takes a lot of time to develop and I

401
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:28,109
don't think there that many people out

402
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:30,570
there who have like fantastic learning

403
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:32,699
how to learn skill sets but it's just

404
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:35,660
something you have to develop over time

405
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:38,219
so that you're you're better suited to

406
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:39,449
not just break into InfoSec but move

407
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:41,639
within that field because you might

408
00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:43,500
break into a position where it wasn't

409
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:45,300
what you expected security to be you're

410
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,949
going to be like I want out okay I still

411
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:49,139
want to try this other area of security

412
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:52,199
but like that has almost a completely

413
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:55,139
different skill set I'm curious what

414
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:57,269
Tracy thinks coming from was a law

415
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:59,010
background yeah and actually that was

416
00:16:57,269 --> 00:17:00,300
kind of my next question as well as for

417
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:01,560
Tracy because you have more of that

418
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,959
public speaking that kind of

419
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,918
communications background I'm curious to

420
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:06,839
know what skills you're currently

421
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:09,089
working on to get more of a technical

422
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:11,639
knowledge as well because you have that

423
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:13,740
that mindset of knowing how to consume

424
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,240
information and you've built kind of

425
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,970
that other side of what Justin and Ming

426
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,620
are suggesting when you when you build

427
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,699
those skills you have those skills what

428
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:22,139
are some of the technical things that

429
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:23,610
you think would be worth covering or

430
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:26,400
things that you found valuable in

431
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:28,530
learning more about yeah that's that's a

432
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,480
great question yeah I am an unique

433
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:33,899
position of already coming into this

434
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,940
with the soft skills with the research

435
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:39,360
skills with the information organization

436
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:42,960
skills so I'm focusing on the

437
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:45,629
side-eye in attending workshops and

438
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:48,210
classes and I'm working on that net plus

439
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:50,880
I have you know in my mind you know I've

440
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:53,760
accepted the fact that certifications

441
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:57,690
are going to be a point you know the way

442
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:59,790
to get past the gatekeepers of you know

443
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:03,540
into places so I'm working on that Plus

444
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:06,240
first and just the technical side of you

445
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:08,520
know I want to be able to basically read

446
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,370
the tweets in my timeline when people

447
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:14,549
make mention to to technical things and

448
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:16,590
I so I do that yeah through structured

449
00:18:14,549 --> 00:18:18,720
learning but I also do it on my own

450
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:21,178
there was a tweet that I sent out today

451
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,340
and some earlier that we're going around

452
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:25,919
of you know don't make someone feel bad

453
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:27,540
if they don't know something or you know

454
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,400
mocks them for asking questions I asked

455
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:31,830
questions all the time if I see a

456
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,450
technical term that I don't understand I

457
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:35,549
go to someone whom I know is

458
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:37,380
approachable and you know what does this

459
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:39,510
mean what you know what's a rat what is

460
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:42,000
you know what is this what you know what

461
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:46,820
what do these things mean so for me I'm

462
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:50,720
I'm focusing on the technical side and

463
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:54,720
if you used to stress me out because I

464
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:57,809
kept thanked saying to myself I have all

465
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:00,330
these many years of lost time to make up

466
00:18:57,809 --> 00:19:02,790
for and it was just seeing it was

467
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:05,370
overwhelming and finally someone said to

468
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:07,049
me well the technology changes

469
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:10,139
dramatically basically every three years

470
00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:11,370
so he said to me I actually envy you

471
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:14,270
he's like I have all this useless

472
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:16,409
information and it's stored in my brain

473
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:18,840
he's like but you get to look at this

474
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:21,540
all new and just build on all the new

475
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:24,059
things going forward so that really

476
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:26,790
changed my point of view and lowered my

477
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:29,850
stress level so I'm just I'm looking at

478
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:31,980
a tech right now and along the way I

479
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:35,280
also want to help others so I know just

480
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:37,650
enough to be dangerous to talk to less

481
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,720
technical audiences than my skillset and

482
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:42,240
just starting mean even with vocabulary

483
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:44,549
words I'll cease the librarian groups

484
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,010
and just kind of introduce you know the

485
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:49,200
terms of ddos to them and what it means

486
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:51,570
and what it means in context to them

487
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,980
doing research and things like that so

488
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:55,320
it's definitely

489
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,850
very technical focus at this point and I

490
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,639
do long for the days when I could read a

491
00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:01,889
novel again but until then I'm quick on

492
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:05,250
just focus on reading a technical book

493
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:06,929
awesome so this is actually a good segue

494
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:08,220
into a question for Justin which is what

495
00:20:06,929 --> 00:20:09,750
are some of the resources that your team

496
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:12,960
is leveraging to develop some of these

497
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:14,700
skills you say research resources so

498
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,890
like are there any particular websites

499
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,570
or particular books that you guys have

500
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:20,190
consumed or enjoyed or tools that you

501
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:25,830
like to work with and play with to

502
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:28,530
develop your skill sets there are those

503
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:31,199
different what are they MOOCs like

504
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:36,270
massively online okay like online

505
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:38,669
courses yep yeah yeah that every now and

506
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:40,760
then will run a deal so of course that's

507
00:20:38,669 --> 00:20:43,380
usually 150 bucks it was like 10 bucks

508
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:45,179
and it's you know eight hours 20 hours

509
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:46,500
40 hours of training about like

510
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:48,150
everything you need to know to get

511
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,740
started built to get started building

512
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:53,549
web apps and Python or something like

513
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:55,440
that those are awesome because you get

514
00:20:53,549 --> 00:20:59,010
to do it at your own pace and it's not

515
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,990
just read this book and maybe pop this

516
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:02,190
what you used to put a CD into your

517
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:03,570
computer but now I don't know what they

518
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:05,970
do for those certification books anymore

519
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:07,230
oh you go to like a website download the

520
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:10,160
content or something and watch like a

521
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:12,960
slideshow but those those online

522
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:14,220
training platforms like udemy and you

523
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,049
know code Academy is kind of a lite

524
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,850
version of that or at least last time I

525
00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:19,799
checked you're getting your hands dirty

526
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:21,840
and you're actually building things and

527
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:25,290
doing things actively along with the

528
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:27,389
instruction those are those are pretty

529
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:29,760
invaluable because they don't just cover

530
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:31,710
security topics they'll cover you know

531
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:34,860
other topics within technology and

532
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:37,740
outside of technology trying to think

533
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:39,959
other resources I'm thinking I'll let

534
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:41,250
Ming chime in and I actually do have a

535
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:44,309
planner question for me it's also

536
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:45,390
contingent on that so what so what are

537
00:21:44,309 --> 00:21:46,710
some of the resources mean that you're

538
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:48,330
actually suggesting students go through

539
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:50,520
are there any specific books or websites

540
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:52,439
that you've really enjoyed or even like

541
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,668
programs or anything that you think that

542
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:57,030
has been really valuable to your

543
00:21:53,669 --> 00:22:01,530
students to start getting involved in

544
00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:04,090
purchasing like learning oh you mean in

545
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:07,450
terms of resources and

546
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:09,580
terms of website I say well I one

547
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:14,250
resource I mentioned all the time to

548
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:17,340
people hacker news here's a reason why

549
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:20,919
we had it's a good smorgasbord of like

550
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:25,928
not only just tech but also societal

551
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:29,080
context of check of technology and it

552
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:33,250
really has a good collection of you know

553
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:35,980
current events and resources like range

554
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:37,419
from how to build something exactly what

555
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:40,990
Justin was saying like how do you

556
00:22:37,419 --> 00:22:43,240
actually build a mobile app with react

557
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:45,760
native and you can even get into

558
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:47,110
discussions such as well what happened

559
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,658
yesterday with a shadow brokers

560
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:53,709
releasing the next ad dump of virus and

561
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:57,370
I say you know the NSA tools it's a real

562
00:22:53,710 --> 00:23:00,070
good smorgasbord of okay what's going on

563
00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:03,239
right now but that's what security is I

564
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:05,830
mean security is what the field is is

565
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:07,510
not just a technical field it's also a

566
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:10,480
non-technical field and that's one of

567
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:12,250
the beautiful things I think we one of

568
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,700
the beautiful things about the field is

569
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:19,390
that you know anyone can get into it the

570
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:21,279
barrier of entry is pretty low if you're

571
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:22,450
interested in the legal piece of cyber

572
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:23,770
security and then you can focus on the

573
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:25,330
legal side if you're interested in the

574
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:26,950
privacy piece and go onto property we're

575
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:30,580
interested in the educational piece of

576
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:34,270
it and you go into a educational piece

577
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:38,470
of cybersecurity but it's a broad broad

578
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:41,139
field I would also like to add I am I

579
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:44,409
feel very grateful that I also have some

580
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:47,789
other resources as well too and wait

581
00:23:44,409 --> 00:23:49,960
were you ready yeah it's a nick Davis

582
00:23:47,789 --> 00:23:53,860
there it is

583
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:57,399
and also Sarah Gibson that is right over

584
00:23:53,860 --> 00:24:00,639
there and Nick is a former student of

585
00:23:57,399 --> 00:24:04,689
mine who's rattling out rapid7 Sarah

586
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:07,330
that pure code and yet another resource

587
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:11,409
I can add is like me Tracy

588
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:13,570
Keith Justin and one of the things I

589
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:15,640
have that is very important I tell

590
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:17,290
students is that you know the other the

591
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:20,230
most important resource I think is also

592
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:22,330
people as a networking piece I think

593
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:25,360
people kind of forget how small this

594
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:30,399
field is somehow in some way everyone

595
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:33,010
knows each other and you know it's and I

596
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,600
wish I I knew there's a lot earlier by

597
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:38,980
certainly brain watch a lot a lot of

598
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:42,100
like students that it's it's not what

599
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:43,420
you know who you know and that I'm sure

600
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,929
for those of you who've been in this

601
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:47,490
field

602
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:49,330
that's resonate who every day absolutely

603
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:50,530
just an anything to add for the

604
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:52,270
resources side before we move on to the

605
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:55,240
next set of questions well I I was

606
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:57,250
thinking about how people can be

607
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:59,470
successful after they have just broken

608
00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:00,940
into InfoSec because I think a lot of

609
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:02,680
people here if you're trying to break

610
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:04,090
into InfoSec and you're actually you

611
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:06,730
have a strong desire to do it I think

612
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:10,810
you'll be able to do it but once you get

613
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:12,970
in Jack mentioned in his keynote before

614
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:16,120
that counterintuitive point of doing

615
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:19,330
more work like look for more new things

616
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:21,159
to do with insecurity and this is

617
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:22,419
something that you know from my personal

618
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:25,420
experience I feel like then it's

619
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:28,120
benefiting Benton benefited words

620
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:30,640
benefited oh there it is benefited me a

621
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:34,899
lot when I first broke into InfoSec I

622
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:36,190
started out well before that I was doing

623
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:38,770
some software engineering work

624
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:41,350
unstructured at a large bank in

625
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:44,350
Pittsburgh and then I ended up working

626
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:46,330
at Freddie Mac and I had worked with the

627
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:48,340
recruiters there telling them like I

628
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:50,379
really want to do security work I don't

629
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:52,060
have any security experience I got the

630
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:54,850
security plus certification a few months

631
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:56,710
ago what do you think and the the first

632
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:59,230
project they put me on was working on a

633
00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:01,540
software engineering team but consuming

634
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:03,790
you know application security reports

635
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:05,470
static code analysis reports coming from

636
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:08,889
the security team and I had to go fix

637
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:11,200
those bugs but eventually you know I was

638
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:13,420
already within a rotational program

639
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,210
there and that helps but after I had

640
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:17,110
moved on to my next rotation which was

641
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:19,570
non-technical security work on a

642
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:20,979
governance team I started meeting other

643
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:22,990
folks within the broader security

644
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:26,350
department and asking questions and

645
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:27,800
looking around and eventually one of the

646
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:30,540
managers there

647
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:33,120
he came up to me and asked me to help

648
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:35,220
part-time do some of their security risk

649
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:37,169
analyses and then eventually I started

650
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:39,090
to get exposed to doing web application

651
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:40,650
penetration testing and I learned a

652
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:43,290
whole bunch of stuff in a very short

653
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:46,080
amount of time and it really just boils

654
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:49,470
down to persistence and motivation and

655
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:52,020
that comes naturally when you have you

656
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:54,870
know an eighth in and innate interest

657
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:58,530
words are hard today thank you very much

658
00:26:54,870 --> 00:27:00,030
words so one other question I had and

659
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:01,530
this is more specifically for Tracy

660
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:03,570
so Chrissie are there any specific

661
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:05,760
resources that you found useful in terms

662
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:07,500
of other websites or books that you feel

663
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,580
is worth mentioning is something that

664
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:11,070
people that are looking to break into

665
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:12,860
the industry would find it beneficial so

666
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:17,909
the library gets the book question

667
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:20,760
absolutely well I actually was going to

668
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:24,750
talk about social media as being a key

669
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:29,910
resource you know online resources are

670
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:32,310
are great just to kind of tag along with

671
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:34,980
what makes it about people you know

672
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:36,960
don't forget that if someone you know if

673
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:38,670
you start to follow some big names you

674
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,740
know or well-known names or just people

675
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:43,140
and InfoSec that whom you trust you know

676
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:44,280
for their knowledge I take the point of

677
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:46,470
view of you know if they're tweeting an

678
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:48,600
article if they you know went through

679
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:51,390
the effort to send out an article and

680
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:53,790
post on social media I should read that

681
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:56,010
because that is a a reading suggestion

682
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:59,430
um as far as you know I need physical

683
00:27:56,010 --> 00:28:01,770
books off the top of my head I I can't

684
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:06,120
think of any there's there's a lot if

685
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:09,150
you if you go to my my blog I have lots

686
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:11,610
of books that I've received suggestions

687
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:14,970
from people and I've just kind of posted

688
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:16,979
them there I've been so buried in just

689
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:18,530
actual manuals and things like that that

690
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:22,800
I can't really recommend anything

691
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:25,470
specific but I just I don't want to you

692
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:28,320
know play down the social media aspect

693
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:29,730
at all that's a really crucial tool for

694
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,399
learning even just following

695
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:34,230
conversations you know if I see words

696
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:36,510
that I don't know I look some office

697
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:38,970
know if people are tweeting articles or

698
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:40,260
posting articles the LinkedIn that to me

699
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:41,160
that's a sign that that's something that

700
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,200
I should read

701
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:45,330
there's a tool called nuzzle which is a

702
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,180
Twitter aggregator and you can follow

703
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:50,070
people and see the things that they're

704
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:52,350
they're posting and if you see that

705
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:54,629
there's a security article that thirty

706
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:57,240
people in your Twitter network have read

707
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:58,620
or have interacted with then you might

708
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,690
would make it a priority to read that

709
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:03,360
then if so many people are looking at it

710
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:06,450
so you know kind of look to social media

711
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,860
as a tool as well awesome and one other

712
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:09,300
thing is well I know specifically for

713
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:11,459
books one of the places that I've gone

714
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:14,340
is the Palo Alto Networks cyber security

715
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:17,460
Canon it's CA and om they have a lot of

716
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:19,169
novels technical books recommendations

717
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:21,120
that they've kind of read through and

718
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:22,590
rated in itself or worth reading so if

719
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,360
you're looking for just some place to

720
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:26,370
start that's one place that I've enjoyed

721
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:28,199
personally so we're going to kind of

722
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:29,310
take a bit of a step ahead on some of

723
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,680
the questions that I've written just

724
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:32,669
given time and this next topic is going

725
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,230
to be more specifically tied to

726
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:35,700
certifications and I'm going to ask kind

727
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:37,170
of each of their viewpoints on

728
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:40,020
certifications from kind of different

729
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:41,730
different perspectives so starting with

730
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,840
with Ming I just want to ask man do you

731
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:45,030
encourage students to pursue

732
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:50,100
certifications and why or why not from

733
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:53,090
your perspective okay so what I'm not

734
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:55,709
going to do is how many people here have

735
00:29:53,090 --> 00:30:02,100
certifications how many people like in

736
00:29:55,710 --> 00:30:04,110
some way a form okay so I'm going to

737
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:06,030
echo something that Tracy said earlier

738
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:08,639
on and because this is actually just

739
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:11,850
what Tracy said earlier segues into this

740
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,800
conversation and I'm sure I heard that

741
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:17,270
Tracy heard I have very mixed opinions

742
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:22,200
on certification was that right Tracy

743
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:24,840
probably yes okay there's a lot of

744
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:27,900
articles out there on the dubious value

745
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:30,240
of certain certifications I think we all

746
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:32,310
know what would I think we know what

747
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,580
certification is in question here I

748
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:39,240
think we know a few letters in it yeah a

749
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:40,889
few letters in it and the worst thing

750
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:43,230
that you want to do to answer this

751
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:44,940
question is if you go completely

752
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:46,740
bad-mouthing

753
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:53,070
a certification or the idea of

754
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:56,370
certification I I do advocate on a cyano

755
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:58,530
very related to that I dare to have a

756
00:30:56,370 --> 00:31:02,010
certification at GCI H through SANS

757
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:03,840
Institute and I do advocate for them I

758
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:07,260
advocate for the SANS Institute I know

759
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:09,000
what they offer I'm an alumnus and it

760
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:11,610
has served me well I'm no longer

761
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,040
certified my certification has expired

762
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:15,780
there are some good ones out there the

763
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,340
best answer is and I've gotten this

764
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:22,050
question a few times from students

765
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:24,780
perhaps I will answer that question in a

766
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:26,639
way that would pass down to me by a

767
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:30,570
gentleman named Peter Sullivan I believe

768
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:32,790
he's at CMU at Kent Carnegie Mellon he

769
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:37,080
was on the HTC I a the high-tech crime

770
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:39,210
investigation in 2007 I was like many of

771
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:41,490
he make like many people I would kind of

772
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:44,670
figure out what to do with my next step

773
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:46,740
in my career in my life I mean I was out

774
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:49,740
a loss I would literally like at a

775
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:51,900
standstill and I was questioning that I

776
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:58,020
would I've been seriously expand during

777
00:31:51,900 --> 00:32:02,450
getting the CISSP and I asked Peter at a

778
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:04,500
htc I a meeting a BAE Peter you know I

779
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:06,930
am trying to figure out what to do with

780
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:08,880
my next step in my in my life and I'm

781
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:10,530
seriously considering the CISSP because

782
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,270
it seemed like the way to get into the

783
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:17,750
door of a lot of information and a lot

784
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:22,730
of security was a security positions

785
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:27,450
Peter just stood there for 30 seconds

786
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:32,870
dead silent he asked me these he said

787
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:35,970
these words to me do you need it bang

788
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:40,169
that just woke me up

789
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:43,140
then I that that really really like hit

790
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:46,800
me like a truck I had to ask myself did

791
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:49,380
I need it and I answered the short

792
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,520
answer was no I didn't need it in some

793
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:52,590
places if you're going to like the

794
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,940
Department of Defense or in some job

795
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:56,810
yeah you actually do need a

796
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:58,770
certification it's a case-by-case basis

797
00:32:56,810 --> 00:33:02,220
and it's a very the

798
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:05,460
one but if you're going I'm not gonna

799
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:07,830
you know say yes or no but the best

800
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:10,140
answer is ask yourself do you need that

801
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:11,850
certification and this is also a good

802
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:13,890
one for Justin I think as well as when

803
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:15,540
you're reviewing resumes is it that you

804
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:16,650
find you you're more likely to interview

805
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,879
someone because they have a

806
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:19,800
certification or is it more of like and

807
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:22,410
it depends it's like a maybe icing on

808
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,310
the cake situation or is it you know

809
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:25,050
this person has a certification

810
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:28,320
therefore I'm considering that I should

811
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:32,610
probably interview them yet so the roles

812
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:35,370
that I interview for involve more

813
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:38,040
technical security work around building

814
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:39,780
tooling and performing different

815
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,280
security operations like Incident

816
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:44,010
Response and vulnerability management

817
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:47,250
and things like that so we're keeping an

818
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:52,520
eye out for practical demonstrable

819
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:54,690
experience in those areas and a

820
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:56,580
certification is it a disqualification

821
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:59,820
for those roles but it's not something

822
00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:01,439
that as a requirement either if someone

823
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:03,389
has a certification and puts it on their

824
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,560
resume I'll be like oh so I think I

825
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:09,200
understand what they went through to get

826
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:11,520
that like I I went through the CISSP

827
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:13,408
whatever the most popular book was at

828
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:16,440
the time and the exam and my previous

829
00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:20,940
employer paid for it so it was you know

830
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:23,760
worth doing in my mind but I think what

831
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:25,500
Ming was saying is spot-on it depends

832
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,990
like whether or not you get a certain

833
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:30,770
certification do you need it to get into

834
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:33,779
a certain role you're trying to get into

835
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:36,360
you you definitely get some valuable

836
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:38,399
knowledge out of studying for those

837
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:40,800
exams some of that knowledge is

838
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:42,690
definitely outdated but now you're

839
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,659
getting some historical knowledge that

840
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:47,190
adds context to you know future problems

841
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:49,110
you go out and solve I think I think

842
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:51,870
Jack made a good point during his

843
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:53,460
keynote about how in the security space

844
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:55,739
there are definitely some personalities

845
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:57,990
who cross that boundary between

846
00:34:55,739 --> 00:35:00,240
skepticism and cynicism and they become

847
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:02,569
too cynical about things there is a lot

848
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:06,859
of bashing about certifications

849
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:09,840
there are lots isms of the value of them

850
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:12,200
but I don't think they have no value at

851
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:14,940
all I just don't think that

852
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:17,399
they they're a hurdle that everyone's

853
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,670
going to have to get over to prove their

854
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,280
worth

855
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:22,080
within the InfoSec space or when they go

856
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:24,990
to break into the InfoSec space i think

857
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:29,850
i think you'll find more employers these

858
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:31,410
days will be more impressed by a project

859
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:33,210
that a small project that you have in

860
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:35,640
your github repo look I wrote this

861
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:40,370
Python script or web app that does XYZ

862
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:43,740
security thing oh and you know I'm

863
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:46,170
status with or I participate in these

864
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:47,819
security groups in the area and they're

865
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:51,630
all these other ways other than

866
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:53,520
certifications where you can prove to

867
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:56,220
employers out there that yes I am

868
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:59,940
qualified for this role but certainly if

869
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:03,419
a job posting says minimum requirements

870
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:04,920
CISSP or security plus like yeah get it

871
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:06,900
and it's not going to be a complete

872
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,310
waste of time like some of that

873
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:11,370
knowledge you get might not be useful

874
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:13,770
but other parts of it will will be it's

875
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:16,710
kind of absurd to say it's a complete

876
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:18,480
waste of time and money especially if it

877
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:21,630
does help you get that job that you're

878
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:24,480
trying to get thank you so moving away

879
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:26,070
from the talk of certifications Tracy

880
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:29,340
I'm interested in getting your thoughts

881
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:31,020
on what transferable skills outside of

882
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:33,180
information security have you found to

883
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:37,170
be an asset as you've been moving into

884
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:41,250
the industry being able to top good has

885
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:45,780
been a big skill yes being able to speak

886
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:48,570
to people on different levels within an

887
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:51,030
organization with different skill sets

888
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:54,090
you know I'm come from a background

889
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:56,910
where I'm used to having to enforce

890
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:58,740
copyright within an organization and in

891
00:36:56,910 --> 00:37:00,569
some ways it's not that much different

892
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:04,799
than security because if you do either

893
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:06,690
one wrong you get into trouble so I'm

894
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,540
used to be enabled you know to speak to

895
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:11,370
different levels of people and the

896
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:14,430
organization of information of being

897
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:17,130
able to you know sync through things and

898
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:20,790
with the user in mind of thinking of

899
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:22,950
library policies or even research you

900
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:24,058
know handing over research to someone

901
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:26,609
you know yes this person

902
00:37:24,059 --> 00:37:28,170
and is a well-educated lawyer that I was

903
00:37:26,609 --> 00:37:30,779
doing research for but their office

904
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:32,489
still a human with all kinds of

905
00:37:30,779 --> 00:37:34,259
information surrounding them that they

906
00:37:32,489 --> 00:37:37,769
have to work on for different cases so

907
00:37:34,259 --> 00:37:39,619
being able to be proactive and sort

908
00:37:37,769 --> 00:37:43,169
information in such a way that can be

909
00:37:39,619 --> 00:37:45,989
absorbed more easily so those are a lot

910
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:47,819
of the the non-security skills that I

911
00:37:45,989 --> 00:37:49,469
have that I see are lacking and

912
00:37:47,819 --> 00:37:50,729
sometimes it's very frustrating for me

913
00:37:49,469 --> 00:37:54,180
coming from such an organized

914
00:37:50,729 --> 00:37:55,828
environment to look around in security

915
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:58,469
world and sometimes I just like let me

916
00:37:55,829 --> 00:38:00,900
organize that for you like let me help

917
00:37:58,469 --> 00:38:03,299
you let me let me organize some things

918
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:06,119
and yeah so some of the chaos of

919
00:38:03,299 --> 00:38:11,130
security world is just very is very

920
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:12,539
foreign to me awesome thank you do

921
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:13,619
either of you I mean because we're

922
00:38:12,539 --> 00:38:14,729
coming to the top of the hour I want to

923
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:15,809
make sure you grab a couple other

924
00:38:14,729 --> 00:38:17,218
questions did you guys have anything you

925
00:38:15,809 --> 00:38:19,609
wanted to quickly add in on top of that

926
00:38:17,219 --> 00:38:21,509
in terms of like skills outside of the

927
00:38:19,609 --> 00:38:23,489
technology or maybe the understanding of

928
00:38:21,509 --> 00:38:27,269
security that are beneficial to the job

929
00:38:23,489 --> 00:38:29,249
yeah the risky business podcast is a

930
00:38:27,269 --> 00:38:30,779
great podcast they like a lot of

931
00:38:29,249 --> 00:38:33,269
podcasts they type up their show notes

932
00:38:30,779 --> 00:38:37,439
that have you know 20 or so links in

933
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:39,328
them about very relevant articles about

934
00:38:37,439 --> 00:38:40,618
what's happening in the security space

935
00:38:39,329 --> 00:38:44,459
and they have some interesting

936
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:47,839
interviews as well also if you're trying

937
00:38:44,459 --> 00:38:51,178
to have more relevant or well-rounded

938
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:53,459
skills or experience when breaking into

939
00:38:51,179 --> 00:38:54,929
empathic or building out your job

940
00:38:53,459 --> 00:38:58,049
opportunities after you break into

941
00:38:54,929 --> 00:39:00,349
InfoSec learning about like DevOps

942
00:38:58,049 --> 00:39:03,719
DevOps practices and tooling like chef

943
00:39:00,349 --> 00:39:05,699
and getting exposure like go to a DevOps

944
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:07,199
Meetup and a security meetup like get

945
00:39:05,699 --> 00:39:09,660
exposure to that community as well

946
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:10,559
because when you break into and foe sec

947
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:13,140
you're going to be working with those

948
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:15,089
people a lot and those skill sets are

949
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:19,379
going to help you do a better job at

950
00:39:15,089 --> 00:39:22,288
security awesome so I'm going to echo

951
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:24,599
both what Justin Tracy said I mean they

952
00:39:22,289 --> 00:39:26,789
nailed it spot-on and I actually would

953
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:28,739
like to add them both together anyone

954
00:39:26,789 --> 00:39:30,630
hear from anyone here from UMass Amherst

955
00:39:28,739 --> 00:39:33,779
anyone anyone has you met from UMass

956
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:34,859
Amherst so Brian Levine who was a

957
00:39:33,779 --> 00:39:37,339
professor in the computer science

958
00:39:34,859 --> 00:39:41,749
department said last year

959
00:39:37,339 --> 00:39:45,109
at the sicán new england security day he

960
00:39:41,749 --> 00:39:48,069
said he had a slide that should resonate

961
00:39:45,109 --> 00:39:50,509
pretty well is educate yourself loudly

962
00:39:48,069 --> 00:39:55,339
because sometimes the best answer is not

963
00:39:50,509 --> 00:39:57,920
technical I don't know if a lot of

964
00:39:55,339 --> 00:40:03,219
people know but I work here at Harvard

965
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:06,259
for 10 years so for me I left in 2010 I

966
00:40:03,219 --> 00:40:08,089
it was a very good 10 years but it was

967
00:40:06,259 --> 00:40:11,119
time for me to go and I left on my own

968
00:40:08,089 --> 00:40:13,700
terms so it's interesting to be back

969
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:16,700
here at Harvard I worked in

970
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:19,549
environmental health and safety and I

971
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:22,609
was the only tech guy in environmental

972
00:40:19,549 --> 00:40:26,390
health and safety and one of the things

973
00:40:22,609 --> 00:40:30,078
that really served me well working with

974
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:33,348
a lot of non-technical people was I had

975
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:34,880
to communicate a lot of ideas and that

976
00:40:33,349 --> 00:40:36,140
that served me well for a number of

977
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,210
reasons but three things in particular

978
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:40,848
number one I had to communicate with a

979
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:42,019
lot of non-technical people so it wasn't

980
00:40:40,849 --> 00:40:44,569
about the programming language the

981
00:40:42,019 --> 00:40:46,578
framework the database problem no it had

982
00:40:44,569 --> 00:40:48,680
to be in simple simple language that

983
00:40:46,579 --> 00:40:51,619
business people are the business owners

984
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:59,538
and the stakeholders had to know well

985
00:40:51,619 --> 00:41:04,009
that's number one number two is it was

986
00:40:59,539 --> 00:41:07,069
environmental health and safety and you

987
00:41:04,009 --> 00:41:08,450
know as now when I think a lot about the

988
00:41:07,069 --> 00:41:09,979
past I'm very grateful for the

989
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:12,288
opportunity to hear that I had at

990
00:41:09,979 --> 00:41:14,680
Harvard working in environmental health

991
00:41:12,289 --> 00:41:18,349
and safety and the reason is is because

992
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:20,598
you know it was health and safety and

993
00:41:18,349 --> 00:41:23,239
that what it means is health and safety

994
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:24,769
first if you go to a civil environmental

995
00:41:23,239 --> 00:41:26,029
engineering program you can't get a

996
00:41:24,769 --> 00:41:27,890
civil environmental and engineering

997
00:41:26,029 --> 00:41:30,799
degree without running about health and

998
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:33,259
safety but you can walk away with a

999
00:41:30,799 --> 00:41:34,700
computer science to computer engineering

1000
00:41:33,259 --> 00:41:37,460
degree without knowing a damn thing

1001
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:39,259
about health safety and security and I

1002
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:40,430
feel ultimately that's the probably we

1003
00:41:39,259 --> 00:41:44,239
have a lot of problems that we are

1004
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:47,089
facing right now but having that mindset

1005
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:50,990
of environmental health and safety first

1006
00:41:47,089 --> 00:41:52,820
I really didn't put together the pieces

1007
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:55,160
until recently and so I'm very grateful

1008
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:57,860
for that and that's the mindset that I

1009
00:41:55,160 --> 00:42:02,810
developed over there but number three

1010
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:04,990
what was also important is understanding

1011
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:07,670
the business Pro the business context

1012
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:11,000
you know learn about the subject matter

1013
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:13,100
in this case was like things like

1014
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,610
Occupational Safety industrial hygiene

1015
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:18,230
lab safety try to learn the basics of

1016
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:20,630
though it wasn't learning about the next

1017
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:24,710
programming language or you or whatever

1018
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:26,690
cooler framework at that time was thank

1019
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:27,830
you very much so since we're coming here

1020
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:29,630
toward the end of the talk I just wanted

1021
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:30,590
to give each of the speakers an

1022
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,030
opportunity to answer the following

1023
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:34,040
question we're going to start with Tracy

1024
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:36,619
and ago Ming and then Justin to close

1025
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:38,720
what parting wisdom do you want to share

1026
00:42:36,619 --> 00:42:43,400
for the for those that want to break

1027
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:48,500
into InfoSec starting with Tracy I would

1028
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:51,650
say that your people skills honing your

1029
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:53,990
people skills networking being able to

1030
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:55,850
explain things to people any sort of

1031
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:59,600
people feels is really going to be

1032
00:42:55,850 --> 00:43:02,810
paramount to not only your own success

1033
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:05,118
but just the success of the industry is

1034
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:08,240
how I see it so if you don't already

1035
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:10,700
have those soft skills work on them and

1036
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,790
if you need help ask there's you know

1037
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:15,439
whole community but I would say of

1038
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:19,070
people skills so those sort of soft

1039
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:20,570
skills are really a key to success so

1040
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:22,850
aiming again just to repeat the question

1041
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:23,930
what parting wisdom do you want to share

1042
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:29,650
for those that want to break into

1043
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:29,649
InfoSec InfoSec is a lifestyle

1044
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:39,770
there it is Thank You Ming Justin um I

1045
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:41,720
want to emphasize maybe in a different

1046
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:46,700
way what Tracy was saying about people

1047
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:49,640
skills in my experience and from what I

1048
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:52,970
understand about a lot of security roles

1049
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:57,770
out there in the world security teams

1050
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:59,629
are omniscient and they are engineering

1051
00:43:57,770 --> 00:44:04,320
and IT counterparts tend to be

1052
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:07,740
omnipotent and so you will know a

1053
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:09,720
a lot of stuff that's wrong with your

1054
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:11,819
organization that needs to get fixed how

1055
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:13,919
to fix it and you won't be able to do a

1056
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:16,950
thing about it and it's going to drive

1057
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:19,110
you crazy unless you have those people

1058
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:20,460
skills and I don't think I need to

1059
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:22,080
reiterate a lot of the other stuff we

1060
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:24,660
talked about in terms of how to develop

1061
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:27,720
technical skill sets and other security

1062
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:30,359
skill sets people skills are important

1063
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:33,569
when you think about it this way when

1064
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:35,010
you're doing work with a computer it can

1065
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:37,710
be frustrating sometimes you have to

1066
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:40,080
translate some desire you have into

1067
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:42,420
something the computer understands but

1068
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:44,460
once you do that translation computer

1069
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:47,910
will do it for you when you're working

1070
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:50,670
with sentient biological neurological

1071
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:52,819
computers you still have to do that same

1072
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:54,570
process taking a desire you have

1073
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:56,820
translating it into something they

1074
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:59,640
understand but then you have to convince

1075
00:44:56,820 --> 00:45:02,340
that computer that they want to do that

1076
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:04,799
too and if you can't do that it's not

1077
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:06,810
going to last in the long run like even

1078
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,670
even if in the short term they're not

1079
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:10,020
convinced that they want to do what you

1080
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:11,820
want them to do but they'll do it anyway

1081
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:13,020
because security team told them and they

1082
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:14,400
will go get in trouble if they don't do

1083
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:16,230
it or something like that that's going

1084
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,820
to last for a few months maybe a year or

1085
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:21,090
something like that you need to hone

1086
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:22,200
those people skills one because the

1087
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:25,230
right thing to do you don't want to like

1088
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:27,029
have awful relationships with people at

1089
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:30,060
work and you want to work well with

1090
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:31,740
other people but you'll be more

1091
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:33,630
successful and the security of your

1092
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:35,069
organization will go up because of it

1093
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:37,440
because those people will do what you

1094
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:38,370
need them to do from a security

1095
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,040
perspective

1096
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:42,690
end of sentence awesome thank you very

1097
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:44,279
much so again I just want to thank the

1098

1103
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:52,800
one on one basis I know that the
