1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,970
one of my favorite people so we got Jack

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:08,240
Jack Daniel Jack is the when ice age

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:11,309
fill in the blank here for job title at

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,690
tenable security he has over 20 years

5
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:14,610
experience in networking system

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:18,090
administration and I think his epic

7
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:21,060
beard has well over 30 jack is a

8
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:23,850
technology community activist jack is a

9
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,859
co-founder of security besides movement

10
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:29,220
and he serves on the board of directors

11
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:33,390
for security besides Las Vegas and for

12
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:35,280
security besides Incorporated he's also

13
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,200
a frequent speaker at technology and

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,120
security events large and small and he

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,340
has co-hosted pall security weekly where

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,959
I think they discussed security some

17
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,559
times but they might do some other

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,480
things on the show as well so just like

19
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,730
Dave this morning I also asked jack

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,629
friends for a comment about him

21
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:57,390
and besides Las Vegas president fan she

22
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:59,280
said Jack Daniel is a misnomer of a name

23
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,840
while gentlemen jack certainly fits this

24
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,820
guy is much smoother and more

25
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,589
sophisticated than any straight whiskey

26
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,750
he's a bespoke cocktail made of the

27
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:09,000
essence of community a jigger of

28
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,850
irreverence and a few dashes of humility

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,590
I think most of us would probably agree

30
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:21,240
that about Jack Jack is a reluctance the

31
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:24,509
ISSP holds the CCF K and as Microsoft

32
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,259
MVP for enterprise security Jack's

33
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:27,420
uncommon sense

34
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:30,090
security blog was named to the security

35
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,320
bloggers Hall of Fame in 2013 and it's

36
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,110
my honor to introduce our keynote

37
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:43,818
speaker Daniel

38
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:43,819
[Applause]

39
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:50,430
and now we do combat with technology

40
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:03,130
look at that no stupid speaker turns

41
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:04,150
itself off so there's my presentation

42
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:07,060
tip for you if you ever give

43
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:09,009
presentations whatever you do wrong or

44
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,840
your note go back into that slide deck

45
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:13,630
at a hidden slide at the very beginning

46
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,910
to remind yourself of stuff like I just

47
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:19,440
did there which is this stupid speaker

48
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:19,440
I'm going to use turns itself off so

49
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:26,530
let's see let's turn things on let's

50
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:29,350
let's make some nice yeah

51
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:32,530
wallpaper I have no idea why my wife

52
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:37,870
bought that painting for me honey badger

53
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:41,310
clutching a cocktail I have no idea what

54
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:41,310
that symbolizes

55
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:49,570
okay this is where we do mortal combat

56
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,160
with technology

57
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:57,609
anyone ever feel that their love of

58
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:58,989
Technology is unrequited here we go now

59
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:17,230
this is where it gets tricky because I

60
00:02:58,989 --> 00:03:19,750
try to use music and stuff this is this

61
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:21,760
is where we argue with the technology

62
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:24,959
again come on

63
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,959
see I know go do that

64
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:38,120
see try to be clever jack look what

65
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:48,730
happens where you won't see you see that

66
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:48,730
did it did it let's try this again

67
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:58,519
[Music]

68
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:00,260
that's called pandering by the way

69
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:05,930
that's your second tip on presentation

70
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:11,060
pander to the audience all right uh but

71
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:12,650
first a couple of you might have seen

72
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:17,450
Jeff's comment I'm going to keep this

73
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:20,030
short three weeks ago we lost Becky bass

74
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:22,520
if you did not know Becky I feel sorry

75
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:26,809
for you she was an amazing person I

76
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:28,310
won't go into depth but info mom I only

77
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:30,560
got to know her in the past few years

78
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:32,000
she was an amazing person she was a

79
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,110
mentor to more people than you would

80
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,050
believe a single person could be and how

81
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:44,090
many folks in here knew Becky the new

82
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:46,670
Becky well okay Becky as you know then

83
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:47,840
end of your career before she passed

84
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:50,120
away at the University of South Alabama

85
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,549
and as all good professors she left us

86
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,530
homework the homework is for those of us

87
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,910
that were touched by Becky to turn out

88
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:58,369
to those of you that didn't raise your

89
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:01,250
hands and be here to support you because

90
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:03,640
that's what community is about people

91
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:06,590
have come before us and been amazing and

92
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:08,360
we owe it to them to continue that which

93
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:09,500
is good segue into an I projects which

94
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,330
I'm not really going to talk about but

95
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,860
I'm going to mention this one of the

96
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:14,150
things that I talk about sometimes and

97
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:17,090
I've got a project called the shoulders

98
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:19,929
of InfoSec it's a horrible wiki but the

99
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:22,130
talks are sometimes entertaining

100
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:24,380
historical figures in our industry the

101
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:28,130
folks that got us where we are and some

102
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:29,960
of their stories the truth of this

103
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:31,400
industry is no matter how you enter it

104
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,140
whether you're trying to get into the

105
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,489
industry or whether you've been in it

106
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:37,280
for decades

107
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:38,870
you run full-tilt trying to keep up and

108
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,059
we rarely have a chance to look back and

109
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:42,409
figure out where we came from and how we

110
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,419
got there

111
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:46,219
and that's a look back and sometimes

112
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:48,769
it's great to remember the folks that

113
00:05:46,219 --> 00:05:49,759
came before honor them the known and the

114
00:05:48,769 --> 00:05:52,969
unknown

115
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:55,519
sometimes it's depressing as hell to

116
00:05:52,969 --> 00:05:58,009
like look at the ware report for the

117
00:05:55,519 --> 00:06:01,819
Anderson report or the orange book and

118
00:05:58,009 --> 00:06:03,499
realize how far we haven't come but

119
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:07,039
anyway that's just a side project and

120
00:06:03,499 --> 00:06:11,139
now you are here you probably figured

121
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:13,279
that out so this is that besides Boston

122
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:16,579
let's see how many people are from

123
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:18,379
Boston Proper here which is like all of

124
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:28,969
the cool things in Boston actually in

125
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:34,249
Cambridge that's that's pandering to one

126
00:06:28,969 --> 00:06:35,779
side of the river yeah over here on this

127
00:06:34,249 --> 00:06:38,589
side we have all the cool schools and

128
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:38,589
all the student debt

129
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:46,339
ouch but here's the key thing you're

130
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:48,499
also part of all of this we're here but

131
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:50,929
we're part of this these are the

132
00:06:48,499 --> 00:06:53,689
security b-sides venues across North

133
00:06:50,929 --> 00:06:56,508
America and the green dots are the

134
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:59,559
places that have one's first-time events

135
00:06:56,509 --> 00:07:06,199
coming up Springfield Missouri and

136
00:06:59,559 --> 00:07:07,729
Edmonton and Alberta that's like out

137
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:11,389
there

138
00:07:07,729 --> 00:07:14,419
I mean calgary's out there and then you

139
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:16,279
go beyond out there but here's the

140
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:21,318
amazing thing you're also part of all of

141
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:23,649
this this is the three hundred and

142
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:26,479
twenty second security besides event

143
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:30,889
since a handful of us got together and

144
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:34,489
had a hacker house party con in Las

145
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:36,499
Vegas in July of 2009 and it was a

146
00:07:34,489 --> 00:07:38,808
reaction to the over commercialization

147
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:40,429
of some events and the reaction to some

148
00:07:38,809 --> 00:07:43,999
interesting stuff being turned down

149
00:07:40,429 --> 00:07:48,018
because it just didn't quite fit you

150
00:07:43,999 --> 00:07:50,539
know the very first b-sides was in Vegas

151
00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:53,619
and it was a lot of Def Con 303 Cru a

152
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:53,619
bunch of others

153
00:07:54,990 --> 00:08:01,380
we had the most attended and most talked

154
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:03,780
about a session there was a panel on

155
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:08,030
gender and gender issues and information

156
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:12,568
security 2009 in July a bunch of us

157
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:14,880
misogynistic hackers actually had hosted

158
00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:16,169
a panel that was amazing that's for

159
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,340
those keeping score not that I believe

160
00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:20,310
in keeping score against the big guys

161
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:23,400
but that was over five years before RSA

162
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:26,039
was ready to tackle that it's content

163
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:28,099
that matters to you that makes b-sides

164
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:30,419
it's why these events are so fantastic

165
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:32,130
these sides in the early days I quickly

166
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:33,679
realized there were the three C's that

167
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:37,860
I've considered the pillars of b-sides

168
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:40,380
content community and conversation share

169
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:43,169
good content foster conversation helped

170
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:44,610
build local communities Vegas is a

171
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:46,890
little different because nobody is local

172
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:49,020
in Vegas and locals don't engage except

173
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:50,339
for a few but it that was where you know

174
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:52,020
it really took out one of the things

175
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:53,910
that we realized very quickly was there

176
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:55,770
was a fourth C in that pillar which is

177
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:59,010
career if you actually share a good

178
00:08:55,770 --> 00:09:00,959
content build community have good

179
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:03,149
conversations people's careers advance

180
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:06,630
and that became clearance this is the

181
00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:07,829
kind of what I see is the four C's if

182
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:12,720
you're trying to count you don't have to

183
00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:16,500
106 unique cities have held events 26

184
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,180
countries 28 countries have held events

185
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,800
assuming that we count Scotland as a

186
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,699
separate continent country which it will

187
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,120
be soon enough

188

207
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:33,290
global community if you're growing an

208
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:35,930
entity your foundation has to grow with

209
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:37,880
that everyone here is part of the

210
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:39,829
founders circle welcome to the founders

211

212
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:43,250
fiftieth 'besides

213
00:10:41,209 --> 00:10:44,779
you're part of the founders circle

214
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,899
you're part of the foundation of this

215
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:49,730
community we like to we talk about

216
00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:52,610
participants not attendees that means

217
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:56,000
you talk to people actually engage

218
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:59,029
that's what it's about before I get into

219
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,140
the actual topic I realized I was having

220
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:02,140
a conversation with a friend of mine

221
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:06,890
we're talking about community building

222
00:11:04,459 --> 00:11:08,510
and I distilled all of the essence of

223
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:13,010
community building down to six words now

224
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:16,220
in Boston we have so many I say we even

225
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:19,399
though I've now moved south it's it's

226
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:22,010
such a great community of communities

227
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:23,930
the number of meetups that there are the

228
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:25,579
old Boston Computer Society for folks

229
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:27,790
that have been around it was always a

230
00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:30,439
great region for sharing information

231
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:32,770
part of it is because you may have

232
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,149
noticed there are some pretty cool

233
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:36,949
institutions of learning here we're at

234
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:41,750
one that a lot of people think is cool

235
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:43,970
there right so in six words some are

236
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:46,790
repeated give a darn you might want to

237
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:48,820
use a stronger word but you have to care

238
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:51,199
about the community you're engaged in

239
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:53,000
wow people actually care about stuff

240
00:11:51,199 --> 00:11:54,349
here people are I don't forgive me for

241
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,829
using the word passionate but people are

242
00:11:54,350 --> 00:12:00,940
passionate about technology people are

243
00:11:57,829 --> 00:12:03,410
passionate about sharing their ideas and

244
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:05,360
give people a voice and that's what

245
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:07,880
'besides does and a lot of other things

246
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,640
what I like about communities give

247
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,950
people a voice of course

248
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,240
for talking in the corporate world a lot

249
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:16,300
of you have seen companies that have

250
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,800
like community teams and they don't give

251
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,510
what they just want you to give them

252
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:22,449
money no if you give your customers a

253
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:24,100
voice and then listen that builds

254
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,959
corporate community to which some

255
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,910
companies get but that's not really my

256
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:29,199
world but I'm going to change here and

257
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:32,829
get into what I want to talk about this

258
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,420
talk shifted topic several time and I'm

259
00:12:32,829 --> 00:12:37,390
going to do something I don't like to do

260
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:38,469
I'm going to repeat chunks of talks some

261
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:40,569
of you may have seen a few of these

262
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:42,940
slides but it's a message that hasn't

263
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:45,860
gotten through to enough people so now

264
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:52,380
for something completely different

265
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:52,380
[Music]

266
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:04,420
let's text you back watching this

267
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:20,110
[Music]

268
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:24,209
[Applause]

269
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:26,610
[Music]

270
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:29,170
[Applause]

271
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:30,790
that's a young Korean woman named Luna

272
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:32,019
Lee I thought we would put that in there

273
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:36,040
for a little break to tell you we're

274
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:37,869
changing direction she M that's not

275
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,059
where you expected that to go when you

276
00:13:37,869 --> 00:13:42,429
heard the the beginning of the guitar

277
00:13:40,059 --> 00:13:43,899
solo that's a traditional Korean

278
00:13:42,429 --> 00:13:47,230
instrument called Agra gyeom and she

279
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:50,170
does a ton of classic rock covers blues

280
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:52,929
covers on the gyeom she started to do

281
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:56,439
vocals she has an elfin Korean voice

282
00:13:52,929 --> 00:13:57,850
that sides crazy but anyway that was

283
00:13:56,439 --> 00:13:59,410
just to show you we were changing

284
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:03,600
direction and I think that worked

285
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:08,279
she shredding on the gig I am is not

286
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:11,110
normal rock lexicon but there we go so

287
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:13,919
this section is called put on your own

288
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:17,919
mask before helping others

289
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:20,259
we're in New England I've spent 40 years

290
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:25,509
here I moved here temporarily I moved to

291
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:27,429
Cape Cod temporarily in 1977 and it's

292
00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:30,009
interesting because we're tough we're

293
00:14:27,429 --> 00:14:31,749
stoic right which is an interesting word

294
00:14:30,009 --> 00:14:34,569
because the word stoic means one thing

295
00:14:31,749 --> 00:14:37,749
and the practice of stoicism needs

296
00:14:34,569 --> 00:14:39,549
something very different we're tough we

297
00:14:37,749 --> 00:14:40,869
can do stuff our technology we're going

298
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:42,399
to work ourselves to do you think those

299
00:14:40,869 --> 00:14:44,439
people in Silicon Valley work hard no

300
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,699
they work long hours they're just not

301
00:14:44,439 --> 00:14:48,730
very good so they have to work really

302
00:14:45,699 --> 00:14:50,979
long hours we're good and therefore we

303
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:53,949
get a lot done and we work even longer

304
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:58,089
hours because we're hard-working New

305
00:14:53,949 --> 00:14:59,559
Englanders damn it it's a good thing we

306
00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:01,239
don't burn ourselves out it's a good

307
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:02,559
thing we don't suffer from stress it's a

308
00:15:01,239 --> 00:15:05,410
good thing we don't take that stress

309
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:08,019
home so I hope no one gets value from

310
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:09,819
this presentation because if you don't

311
00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:11,889
get any value from this you aren't

312
00:15:09,819 --> 00:15:13,628
stressed nobody in your life is stressed

313
00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:16,539
nobody's suffering the things that life

314
00:15:13,629 --> 00:15:19,040
throws at us you're not paying attention

315
00:15:16,539 --> 00:15:22,790
to cable news you know yeah I don't know

316
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:24,500
Oh also this laptop and this version of

317
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:27,680
PowerPoint have become sentient and they

318
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:30,950
heckle me in my own presentations so aim

319
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:33,500
high why this topic I love my job I have

320
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:34,640
an amazing job I hardly have a job at

321
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,890
all

322
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:39,830
I have a job with a company that you

323
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:43,340
know and I'm not a have been on a slide

324
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:45,440
earlier but but most of my job is

325
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:48,340
engaging with communities whether or not

326
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:52,360
it has anything to do with the company

327
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:54,590
because we actually value this community

328
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:57,050
so I work at tenable network security

329
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:58,760
you know what's really cool if it

330
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:03,189
weren't for those of us in the space

331
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:06,220
where our sales teams compete daily

332
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:11,660
rapid7 and Qualis and tenable and

333
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:14,450
tripwire our space sponsors more of

334
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:16,100
these events bigger and smaller events

335
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:17,840
puts people out that speak how many

336
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,600
rapid7 speakers are here I mean they're

337
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:22,280
across the room so it's really cool and

338
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:25,310
I think it's awesome that I'm part of

339
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:27,740
this I have an amazing job but you know

340
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:33,890
the reality is not everybody's job is

341
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:36,080
great hello this is Danny and how

342
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:38,449
psychologist Annette and Clark penny I'm

343
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:40,250
sick of typing I want to quit but I

344
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:43,040
don't know how I support myself if I did

345
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:46,490
I ask yourself this question what is it

346
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,410
that you really enjoy about typing are

347
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:50,420
you feel bad I don't like anything about

348
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:52,699
typing every morning when I get ready

349
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:54,920
for work I start crying what's wrong

350
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:56,730
with me you hate your work it's normal

351
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:59,988
have a good day

352
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:59,989
[Applause]

353
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:06,130
it turns out not everybody has a great

354
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,129
job

355
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:14,869
turns out life is more than work Clark

356
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:16,880
at least it ought to be so we should is

357
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:21,679
going to be prepared for ourselves

358
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:24,530
friends family peers community several

359
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:26,750
years ago dan gear said this and I have

360
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:28,760
to thank gone sir for grabbing this

361
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:31,670
quote and showing it to me security is

362
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:34,670
too wide to master too deep to know and

363
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:36,980
too fast to photograph and Dan said this

364
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:39,470
several years ago I don't know if you've

365
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:41,540
noticed it hasn't gotten easier it

366
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:44,240
hasn't gotten narrower it hasn't gotten

367
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:54,970
shallower it certainly hasn't slowed

368
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:58,100
down so um so a couple of months ago

369
00:17:54,970 --> 00:18:01,160
Joey who does D F IR posted this on

370
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:02,899
Twitter and after this question and here

371
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,030
were the results

372
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:08,930
fewer can D F IR have you had a case

373
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:19,879
that bothered you after so as you can

374
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:21,770
see 22% lied and 40% I drink a lot no

375
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,140
kidding really that's it

376
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:26,560
the threat landscape summarized in the

377
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:31,489
immortal words of Bob Dylan

378
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:31,489
[Music]

379
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:41,899
yes I have fun with audio clips a few

380
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:43,639
times so where does that leave us well I

381
00:18:41,899 --> 00:18:44,510
mean we're trying to do a good job we're

382
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:48,169
trying to share we're trying to move

383
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:50,629
forward but we have some challenges yeah

384
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:52,730
it's what's gone

385
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:54,380
you know thankfully none of us are

386
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:56,720
trying to defend networks with say

387
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:59,120
Windows systems on them this weekend

388
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:04,190
right it's not like it's a holiday

389
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:11,570
weekend with a b-sides when and then the

390
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:13,309
bad days look more like alright maybe

391
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:15,860
that was a bit harsh so we can give you

392
00:19:13,309 --> 00:19:16,370
the feline face ohm if that's better for

393
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:19,340
you

394
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:21,168
so how do we cope you know and not just

395
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:23,570
cope we want to survive and thrive we

396
00:19:21,169 --> 00:19:27,169
want to be productive arguably we even

397
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:34,480
want to be happy so what we're trying to

398
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:36,770
do is not end up listening to this sound

399
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,690
lying there in the bed and that sexy

400
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:42,560
Johnny that they put you in machines

401
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:45,080
[Music]

402
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:49,129
we're hoping to actually be productive

403
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:51,080
and healthy so disclaimer pay no

404
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:53,600
attention to me just because I am

405
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,070
dressed like a madman and have a giant

406
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,649
eunuchs beard does not mean that I know

407
00:19:55,070 --> 00:20:03,490
anything but I do have the microphone

408
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:06,860
and a clicker which makes me an expert

409
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:12,230
I'm an amateur guide best I get my lost

410
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:13,909
myself here's what I know something

411
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:16,580
about so one of the things that I've

412
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:20,420
discovered about stress is it will

413
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:22,639
destroy your memory recreational

414
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:27,560
marijuana I can't lose any more

415
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:34,190
short-term memory like I I want to do it

416
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:36,260
but I keep forgetting to smoke it's real

417
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:40,480
the first time we had some interesting

418
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:42,860
family crisis many years ago my doctor

419
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,660
who I saw a couple of days ago he's been

420
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:49,250
my primary care physician since I was a

421
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:50,930
teenager yes he is old like hey so

422
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:52,130
you're going to notice some things going

423
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:53,810
through the stuff you're going through

424
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:56,150
including memory loss and it'll get

425
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:58,220
better and every big stress cycle in my

426
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:59,900
life since then it gets worse I bounced

427
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:01,880
back less and less I tend to walk around

428
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:03,740
with notepads have five or six

429
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:06,920
note-taking apps on my phones things

430
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:08,740
like that but it's true so the stress

431
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:11,690
now the good thing is if you work and

432
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:12,800
forgive me cybersecurity the good thing

433
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:17,840
is we really don't have to remember

434
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:20,629
anything so stress that really is it's

435
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,310
real there's any kind of stress chemical

436
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:26,750
or physical so putting your body under

437
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:28,490
stress we'll talk about that but so when

438
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:30,020
people here's one just a chemo brain

439
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:32,180
when people talk about chemo brain

440
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:34,430
they're just starting to believe that's

441
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:36,050
a real thing of course anybody that's

442
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:38,060
ever been through chemotherapy will tell

443
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:40,159
you of course it's a real thing so

444
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:41,750
anything that stresses your body whether

445
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,610
it's work-related family related to

446
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:46,130
weather has a negative impact on memory

447
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:49,459
and I've got to talk about this one

448
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:50,930
because I have no idea why they invited

449
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:52,970
me to keynote like they're people that

450
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:54,950
actually do that are here today why

451
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:58,100
don't you have them up here

452
00:21:54,950 --> 00:22:00,080
I am an intermittently entertaining old

453
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:01,939
guy I don't understand why anyone has

454
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:05,629
any respect for me and I'm not kidding

455
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:07,789
when I say that I guess I've done some

456
00:22:05,629 --> 00:22:09,469
stuff you know but everybody here's done

457
00:22:07,789 --> 00:22:14,330
stuff where I'm in a room full of

458
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:17,269
brilliant people at here right thank you

459
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:20,539
why I don't know a lot of us do this and

460
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:22,700
I think a little bit of humility is a

461
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:25,669
great thing you know don't be too full

462
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:28,690
of yourself we have enough of those in

463
00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:30,649
this industry but it can also be

464
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:32,389
debilitating if you don't believe you

465
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:34,189
deserve the opportunity you get you know

466
00:22:32,389 --> 00:22:36,469
the reality is a lot of times in this

467
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:38,450
industry you don't deserve the

468
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:40,190
opportunity you get but you get the

469
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:43,519
opportunity and there are two different

470
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:45,169
ways to look at it well ideally I would

471
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:47,149
have earned this first but damn it I'm

472
00:22:45,169 --> 00:22:52,999
going to earn it now that's the correct

473
00:22:47,149 --> 00:22:54,350
one the other one is the flip those are

474
00:22:52,999 --> 00:22:55,850
those people who think they know what

475
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:57,289
they're talking about but really don't

476
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:59,689
these are actually opposite into the

477
00:22:57,289 --> 00:23:02,929
spectrum the people who think they're

478
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:06,970
brilliant it's interesting in a hacker

479
00:23:02,929 --> 00:23:10,999
community in particular most people who

480
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:12,529
you know have impostor syndrome you know

481
00:23:10,999 --> 00:23:13,700
they should flip there are a lot of

482
00:23:12,529 --> 00:23:15,230
people that really need to doubt

483
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:17,629
themselves that don't don't just leave

484
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:18,590
it that so if we're talking about stress

485
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:21,199
and we're not going to get into the

486
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:23,720
burnout stuff a touch on it briefly but

487
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,279
when you talk about a clinical stress

488
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,799
clinical burnout there are three key

489
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:31,249
words three measures Christina Maas walk

490
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:33,259
to the seminal work on this there's one

491
00:23:31,249 --> 00:23:35,090
good word two bad words the good word is

492
00:23:33,259 --> 00:23:37,240
efficacy personal efficacy are you

493
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:40,249
effective do you feel you're effective

494
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:45,169
do you feel like you're doing a good job

495
00:23:40,249 --> 00:23:48,980
that doesn't mean are we beating the bad

496
00:23:45,169 --> 00:23:52,929
guys every day but it's do you feel like

497
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:52,929
you're contributing are you doing well

498
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:58,009
the two bad words are exhaustion and

499
00:23:55,879 --> 00:24:00,259
this is you know that we got to decide

500
00:23:58,009 --> 00:24:01,580
good exhaustion right if you're you're

501
00:24:00,259 --> 00:24:03,379
one of those crazy people that cares

502
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:07,220
about health and stuff and like runs and

503
00:24:03,379 --> 00:24:08,120
crap that good tired you get or you know

504
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,620
you finished a prod

505
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:11,600
and you feel good about it you're tired

506
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:15,260
you feel good now this is the

507
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:19,219
debilitating crushed exhaustion and then

508
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:20,900
the third one is cynicism and in some

509
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:23,990
studies we've done that is the core

510
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:27,470
competency of information security and

511
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:29,120
hacker world and I say that cynicism is

512
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:31,940
and it's interesting because this is

513
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,389
lying you cross you can't be good at

514
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,460
this

515
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:37,430
I don't believe unless you're skeptical

516
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:39,320
don't take stuff at face value crossing

517
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:44,990
the line into cynicism starts to get

518
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:47,960
dangerous in other fields in medical

519
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:50,090
fields or in social work that instead of

520
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,350
being cynicism is depersonalization when

521
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:53,629
you no longer care about the people that

522
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:55,850
you're responsible for in these things

523
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:58,070
but ours the cynicism and boy are we

524
00:24:55,850 --> 00:25:01,580
good at it now one very important thing

525
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:03,830
is this George Carlin quote which hurts

526
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:05,720
me every time I put it up or somebody

527
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:07,909
actually it gets thrown back at me more

528
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,680
often than I share it these days inside

529
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:12,350
every cynical person is a disappointed

530
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:14,030
idealist and that is also true

531
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:16,280
in our community and so that

532
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:17,660
disappointments a little rough so some

533
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:20,180
years ago a bunch of us did a study on

534
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:24,230
burnout we went through the numbers and

535
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:26,210
what we saw it was since I'm in an

536
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:28,780
actual institution I will you know give

537
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:31,100
the disclaimer it was statistically

538
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:32,930
insignificant but potentially

539
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:36,520
informative it's kind of the way I feel

540
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:39,470
about most of what I have to say too but

541
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:42,080
so when I started looking at this how

542
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:43,520
you avoid being in the other talk where

543
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,620
people show us the scars from their

544
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:48,020
suicide attempts and things the

545
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:53,260
preventive let's look at the half that

546
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:55,760
had no warning indicators was better

547
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:57,440
random noise generation than what the

548
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:02,740
NSA convinced RSA to put in their

549
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,740
product oh that's mean

550
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:08,499
last time I made that joke I looked up

551
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:14,559
and realized that the core sponsor of

552
00:26:08,499 --> 00:26:16,179
the event was parsing uh so moving on

553
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:19,178
who wants some coffee you all have had

554
00:26:16,179 --> 00:26:20,919
lunch you want some coffee tell me if

555
00:26:19,179 --> 00:26:22,779
this starts to sound painfully familiar

556
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:24,850
so we have a happy little coffee beans

557
00:26:22,779 --> 00:26:27,309
in the mountains right happy little

558
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:29,350
coffee beans and some guy comes and

559
00:26:27,309 --> 00:26:31,320
tears them off of the plant and throws

560
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:34,449
them in a bucket

561
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:38,519
she hasn't been into a bucket cubicle

562
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:42,519
whatever shifts them somewhere where

563
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:45,129
they get roasted and then ground up and

564
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:47,470
put in a machine where they add boiling

565
00:26:45,129 --> 00:26:53,709
hot water sometimes at extreme high

566
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:57,340
pressure cubicle what and then what gets

567
00:26:53,710 --> 00:27:01,960
spit out may be a wonderful magical

568
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:06,009
elixir or it might be burnt and bitter

569
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:07,499
and miserable and vindictive where maybe

570
00:27:06,009 --> 00:27:09,850
not vindictive I'm not sure of it

571
00:27:07,499 --> 00:27:15,669
vindictive coffee well yeah I take that

572
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:17,498
back yeah so you know maybe you're not

573
00:27:15,669 --> 00:27:18,909
into straight espresso shots but maybe

574
00:27:17,499 --> 00:27:21,730
you know you want an Americano or a

575
00:27:18,909 --> 00:27:24,190
latte so you take you take this process

576
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:25,929
and you do this magical bitter complex

577
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:27,580
elixir and maybe you add sweetener maybe

578
00:27:25,929 --> 00:27:30,369
you had creamer maybe add water and you

579
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:33,070
make it good that's what we're trying to

580
00:27:30,369 --> 00:27:35,408
do we're trying to do this stress

581
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:39,269
burnout stack but keep things on the top

582
00:27:35,409 --> 00:27:42,549
above the filter so we have a nice clean

583
00:27:39,269 --> 00:27:45,759
clean crisp coffee that's not burnt and

584
00:27:42,549 --> 00:27:47,529
not fried and so yeah we won't go

585
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:49,840
through that that's too many words so I

586
00:27:47,529 --> 00:27:54,279
did the scientific thing several months

587
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:55,320
ago and I got I mean seriously I got the

588
00:27:54,279 --> 00:28:00,090
like

589
00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:02,730
over 600 individual respondents over 700

590
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:05,360
responses not just on Twitter I got

591
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:08,940
phone calls and texts and emails and

592
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:11,300
things one of the better answers was

593
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:11,300
this

594
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:34,990
so a couple of things that came out of

595
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:38,950
that is I discovered there are large

596
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:41,590
stresses and there are small stresses

597
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:43,510
and some in between but what I what I

598
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:45,820
saw was a split where a lot of people

599
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:47,470
that have coping skills to put up with

600
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:49,360
daily and a lot of people that

601
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:53,080
can deal with big but sometimes

602
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:54,729
they mix them up and so you have to

603
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:58,210
understand the context you're working in

604
00:28:54,730 --> 00:29:00,669
if you have really good daily coping

605
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:02,470
skills in a hopeless situation you are

606
00:29:00,669 --> 00:29:04,620
continuously trying to cope with

607
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:06,789
something hopeless and you're miserable

608
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:13,149
if you don't have those day-to-day

609
00:29:06,789 --> 00:29:15,640
coping skills then you may end up job

610
00:29:13,149 --> 00:29:17,080
hopping because you can't solve little

611
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:19,390
problems and you let it boil up until

612
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:22,000
you can't stand it anymore so what I'm

613
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:23,860
saying is context is important so some

614
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:29,289
of you may know I am a native Texan born

615
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:31,330
and raised in Texas and every few years

616
00:29:29,289 --> 00:29:34,149
they decide that they're going to secede

617
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:37,418
and so here you know I get back to Texas

618
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:40,689
with some regularity I was just in

619
00:29:37,419 --> 00:29:42,190
Dallas a couple of weeks ago and here we

620
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:44,649
have your typical redneck pickup truck

621
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:47,919
and it sends a very clear message right

622
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:49,678
we understand what this redneck with

623
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:52,779
cherry picker in the bed of his truck is

624
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:55,779
telling us with his procession bumper

625
00:29:52,779 --> 00:29:57,520
sticker or do you because it turns out

626
00:29:55,779 --> 00:30:03,929
if there's a Massachusetts plate on that

627
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:03,929
pickup truck the message is and stay out

628
00:30:07,179 --> 00:30:16,810
context matters actually what this means

629
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:18,370
is I love to screw with my neighbors

630
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:21,590
[Applause]

631
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:23,389
but yeah whatever so what I'm saying is

632
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:26,029
sometimes your situation is bad you need

633
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:30,200
to take a big step this is not the place

634
00:30:26,029 --> 00:30:33,200
to take a big step so an ik data common

635
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:36,529
answers from Twitter it must be right so

636
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:40,490
how do you deal badly not well not well

637
00:30:36,529 --> 00:30:42,770
cry grant so but there are a lot of good

638
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:45,470
answers so there's one huge category the

639
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:47,690
number to answer i lump together as do

640
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:49,970
something physical activity this is how

641
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:52,340
most people cope when I used to do

642
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:54,350
support I would get up walk 200 yards

643
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:55,699
out of a building down the street go to

644
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:57,408
Starbucks could have ADD of caffeine

645
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:59,330
walk back down and sit back down in my

646
00:30:57,409 --> 00:31:01,549
cubicle and resume support calls because

647
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:04,789
being caffeinated all day is really good

648
00:31:01,549 --> 00:31:07,520
for stress but the thing is it kept me

649
00:31:04,789 --> 00:31:10,429
from reaching through the telephone you

650
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:15,230
know kept me from implementing dope slap

651
00:31:10,429 --> 00:31:19,669
over IEP which I know some of you would

652
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:21,260
like me to have invented another one

653
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:24,200
that was you know so this is some

654
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:26,720
extreme you know tough mudder move mud

655
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,700
run whatever or get up and walk the

656
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,070
Starbucks or walk around the building or

657
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:33,200

[Music]

664
00:32:06,909 --> 00:32:12,559
that's the sonics from 1965 by the way

665
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:14,510
that's plunk many years before punk

666
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:17,450
that's grunge decades before grunge

667
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:19,010
sonic sir amazing but whatever the music

668
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:22,700
is some people create music some people

669
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:25,549
play in bands people often assume I have

670
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:28,370
some you know ZZ Top or something I

671
00:32:25,549 --> 00:32:31,639
prefer the comparison to Darwin male

672
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:35,658
pattern baldness overweight long beard

673
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:37,760
but I get to master the mp3 player so I

674
00:32:35,659 --> 00:32:39,320
don't play music but I listen to a lot

675
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,690
of music and it's whatever does it for

676
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:44,360

ton of stuff on YouTube amazing you know

679
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:53,268
whatever it does it for you but music

680
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:56,659
really can be good for you and you know

681
00:32:53,269 --> 00:33:00,110
change it up and you know maybe the

682
00:32:56,659 --> 00:33:01,760
death metal stuff isn't ideal for

683
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:07,459
calming you down but whatever does it

684
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:08,879

00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:20,929
so let's talk about alcohol the number

690
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:26,279
one answer

691
00:33:20,929 --> 00:33:27,990
and look I drink too much I like to I'm

692
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:32,159
an amateur bartender and professional

693
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:34,080
drunk what's funny what's funny is I

694
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,389
have made friends with a lot of really

695
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:38,100
talented professional bartenders when I

696
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:39,600
use that line they describe themselves

697
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:41,370
the same way

698
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:44,100
I don't drink near as much as I appear

699
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:46,008
to on Twitter nobody drinks as much as I

700
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:49,678
appear to on Twitter just for the record

701
00:33:46,009 --> 00:33:51,269
I would alright so on the upside I will

702
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:54,210
say most of us feel guilty for how much

703
00:33:51,269 --> 00:33:55,799
we drink but that is that was by far the

704
00:33:54,210 --> 00:34:00,299
number one coping skill that we've got

705
00:33:55,799 --> 00:34:03,570
that's that's an ideal you know at least

706
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:08,399
I try to drink well if not less yeah

707
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:18,179
it's later Jeff thank you which leads

708
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:19,859
into this one so let's see so illegal

709
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:21,960
drugs are a challenge so if they're

710
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:23,190
prescribed some of them are deadly I'm

711
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:27,530
not going to get into the whole thing

712
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:29,879
but if people's prescribed drugs for you

713
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:32,669
you need to take responsibility for your

714
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:35,069
own health care and do some reality

715
00:34:32,668 --> 00:34:37,259
checks on things I'm not saying don't

716
00:34:35,069 --> 00:34:39,810
listen to therapists and clinicians if

717
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:41,730
you need that help get it they're good

718
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:43,889
ones are good just be aware that there

719
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:46,710
are side effects then we get into the

720
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:48,359
legal recreational drugs so marijuana is

721
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:50,310
legal recreationally in a lot of places

722
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:54,750
and medically in law even more places in

723
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:57,000
the US but it's still federally illegal

724
00:34:54,750 --> 00:35:00,030
and it makes trouble for people who are

725
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,609
not US citizens coming back into the

726
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:04,290
u.s. if you admit that you legally

727
00:35:02,609 --> 00:35:07,078
smoked marijuana in Denver when it was

728
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:08,790
legal or Amster you know it's like oh

729
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:10,319
that's illegal and you can't come back

730
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:14,550
so people are having trouble so this is

731
00:35:10,319 --> 00:35:17,339
a challenge but you know marijuana is

732
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:19,589
effects we don't have a lot of

733
00:35:17,339 --> 00:35:22,230
scientific epic evidence it's a lot of

734
00:35:19,589 --> 00:35:25,020
anecdotal evidence whatever you can look

735
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:27,450
at me and see my age yes I grew up in

736
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:28,380
the 60s and 70s I am NOT going to be

737
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:30,000
judgmental

738
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:33,590
about your recreational use of

739
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,360
pharmaceuticals to paraphrase and

740
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:38,510
ambassador Duke just don't be dumb about

741
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,510
it

742
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:43,710
in this I've got a like cross the line

743
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:44,730
into preaching us here a little bit so

744
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:47,910
there's a lot of folks that are into

745
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:49,860
biohacking if you're abusing drugs that

746
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:50,940
have killed generations of people before

747
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:52,680
you

748
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:54,390
you're not biohacking you're abusing

749
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,890
drugs and you're going to be the next

750
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:57,330
generation of people that die doing

751
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:58,620
stupid and I'm not going to say

752
00:35:57,330 --> 00:36:00,299
anything bad about a couple of people in

753
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:02,609
our community that we have lost because

754
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:06,510
there were great people they did dumb

755
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:09,180
 but if Jimi Hendrix and Janis

756
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:11,910
Joplin and generations before and after

757
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:12,419
John Belushi couldn't do it you can't

758
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:17,149
either

759
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:19,410
don't be stupid have fun don't be stupid

760
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:24,060
that's a little too preachy friends and

761
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:26,910
family support especially mutual support

762
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:28,500
is awesome but sometimes it's one-sided

763
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:32,720
one of the interesting things that I've

764
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:35,100
seen as people mature in this industry a

765
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,390
lot of folks end up in this situation

766
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:39,810
where they may have pretty good jobs

767
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:44,370
they've moved careers have a pretty good

768
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:45,870
job if kids in school kids going to

769
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:48,420
college trying to figure out how to pay

770
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:50,370
for that parents going into assisted

771
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:51,960
living facilities so they're caring for

772
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:54,210
the generation before and after at the

773
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:56,340
same time you can have a job as awesome

774
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:58,110
as mine and be in that situation and

775
00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:03,240
realize you need to manage your own

776
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:05,640
stress in your own relationships you

777
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:06,899
know I am not in that situation but you

778
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,210
know one of my peers are you know

779
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:10,410
there's stuff outside you need to think

780
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:12,420
about taking care of yourself because

781
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:15,480
you can't take care of them and if it's

782
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:17,400
mutual it's great but so here's one

783
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,800
disconnect unplug this is one of the top

784
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:23,160
five disconnect and unplug and this is

785
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:25,200
really important if you are more

786
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:26,640
trusting I would suggest that you close

787
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:30,620
your eyes and tilt your head back and

788
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,620
join me on a couple of little adventures

789
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:44,400
rain rides in Spanish I wanted

790
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,399
Hills rolling by

791
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:48,500
Jack's on the hill

792
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:57,560
miles and miles while resident in bloom

793
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:59,920
oh maybe just join me County for

794
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,920
jaywalking

795
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:07,029
is indicated

796
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:16,150
now a couple of you are probably

797
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:17,529
thinking dumbass

798
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:19,210
aren't you saying to disconnect and

799
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:20,470
unplug why were you recording that why

800
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:22,360
were you holding your phone out the

801
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:23,379
window of that train when you should

802
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,310
have been having a good time with your

803
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:26,410
wife

804
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:28,540
you got me also there's this challenge

805
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:31,560
of unplugging when you come back we've

806
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:33,730
all done this right like I'm pretty good

807
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,870
well the beauty is now we don't have to

808
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:38,580
go through that we can put on our

809
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:42,060
SmartWatch and it can haunt us everyday

810
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:42,060
every minute

811
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:47,950
here's the thing there's a latch on this

812
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:52,720
it comes off the other thing that's

813
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:55,299
really cool about this there's a Do Not

814
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:58,359
Disturb button right on your wrist you

815
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:59,950
can like flip the timer to give me 30

816
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:02,890
minutes of peace and quiet set it to do

817
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:04,060
not disturb so now we disconnect unplug

818
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:07,720
there are actually companies that are

819
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:10,420
doing this but a few hours at a time

820
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:12,069
every bit you get disconnected some more

821
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:13,750

20 or 30 minutes while he eats dinner

844
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:10,690
goes back up into his office and instead

845
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:11,350
of facing this way at to his work

846
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:13,480
computer

847
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:15,670
he faces this way into the gaming

848
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:18,640
console and spends the rest of the night

849
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:20,110
there and it works for him but you're

850
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:23,170
still sitting in front of computers you

851
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:24,100
know outdoors he goes outdoors once

852
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:27,070
every week or two

853
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:29,200
to get groceries and it works for him

854
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:32,440
but you know I'm making fun of him but

855
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:34,480
it works well for him but if if it's not

856
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:36,370
working well if you don't do it I got

857
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:39,420
some edge cases I think maybe some of

858
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:39,420
these folks are screwing with me

859
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:43,759
[Applause]

860
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:52,390
I I will say the covering yourself in

861
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:54,520
peanut butter one came from an

862
00:40:52,390 --> 00:41:04,810
Australian friend of mine so that may

863
00:40:54,520 --> 00:41:06,250
actually be true okay and I'm about to

864
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:06,700
be mean to you I'm sorry but I'm going

865
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:08,770
to do it

866
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:10,390
so sometimes life just figures a way to

867
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:13,509
tell you it's time to readjust your

868
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:14,890
perspective on life it's time to take a

869
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:18,820
look at what's important and what's not

870
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:25,710
a couple of you know what's coming sorry

871
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:25,710
I want to be mean this is me in 1976

872
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:35,400
that's my girlfriend later wife we met

873
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:35,400
when she was 14 and I was 15

874
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:43,120
this is on the porch of our winter

875
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:45,720
retreat last year yes those are her

876
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,720
cremated remains

877
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:53,140
do not let life kick you this hard

878
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:58,330
before you figure out what matters and

879
00:41:53,140 --> 00:42:00,520
what doesn't do not do it let's move

880
00:41:58,330 --> 00:42:03,340
beyond that one but let me tell you a

881
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:04,810
few things my mother passed away when I

882
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:07,180
was 31 breast cancer

883
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:09,490
no big surprise 31 is a bit early to

884
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:10,839
lose your parents but yeah it happens

885
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:16,649
she'd been fighting cancer all of her

886
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:19,450
life my own cancer bladder cancer hmm

887
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:21,160
that's non-malignant you just have to

888
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:25,330
have a really awkward exam on a regular

889
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:27,310
basis for the rest of your life if any

890
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:29,710
of you I know what that means so all I

891
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:31,029
did share something else over sharing

892
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:34,030
because I want your attention

893
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:35,410
yesterday was colonoscopy day for me the

894
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:37,310
important thing about that is people

895
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:39,140
tell me I'm full of crap

896
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:53,930
I can bring you a doctor's note proving

897
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:54,650
I'm not at least for today so um so I'm

898
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:56,990
serious yeah

899
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:59,810
Oh cancer oh well the tumors are

900
00:42:56,990 --> 00:43:00,950
non-malignant non metastasizing so what

901
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:01,730
if I spent a couple of years back to

902
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:03,890
back

903
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:06,050
having bladder resections right before

904
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:08,379
going to DEFCON and besides Vegas now

905
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:11,390
whatever you know that's not that's I'm

906
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:16,490
student is 50s with oh it's little

907
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:17,930
cancer right it's minor cancer so yeah

908
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:19,520
it was easy for me because I've had

909
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:21,740
awesome jobs so the past decade but

910
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:25,130
anyway common sense don't face

911
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:27,680
challenges alone in the school play yard

912
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:29,780
do you get to go off now just Boy Scouts

913
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:34,460
Girl Scouts let you know in the military

914
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:36,560
do you go on no but we are all special

915
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:38,720
defin snowflakes and we're going to do

916
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:42,140
this job alone even for our team of 50

917
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:44,359
people and that's not healthy healthy

918
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:47,180
and don't make employees face challenges

919
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:54,140
alone I've got some counterintuitive

920
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:57,560
advice for you do more because doing

921
00:43:54,140 --> 00:44:01,609
things that you want to do that are

922
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:03,980
satisfying and rewarding volunteering

923
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:05,960
mentoring speaking teaching teaching is

924
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:07,670
awesome whether it's informal formal

925
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:09,800
whatever because you have to learn what

926
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:10,850
you're talking about because people are

927
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,820
going to put you on the spot and

928
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:15,950
challenge it and makes you learn things

929
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:18,530
sharing being engaged in community it's

930
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:20,299
why I do what I do because I get a lot

931
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:24,560
of value from what I give to the

932
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:26,420
community mentorship is fantastic if you

933
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:28,850
don't think you are a hypocrite

934
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:30,830
you need to mentor somebody because you

935
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:32,240
will tell them things like I've been in

936
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:35,600
that situation and the one thing you

937
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:38,209
can't do is this phone and then you pick

938
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:39,680
up the bottle and drink because you've

939
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:40,850
done it twice in your career and you're

940
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,730
in the midst of doing it for the third

941
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:45,440
time as you're telling people don't do

942
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:46,940
that that's a terrible mistake that's

943
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,740
career limiting and it's missed you'll

944
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:51,130
be miserable and you know it because

945
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:51,129
you've done it

946
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:58,120
learn something new education is work so

947
00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:59,259
it's got to be satisfying or give you an

948
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:03,009
opportunity to get out of the hell

949
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:04,750
holier in to be blonde I'm going to zip

950
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:08,200
through some things but this is worth

951
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:13,150
noting in the hacker community we've got

952
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:16,899
this challenge you know oh he's the

953
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:20,350
iPhone hacker no he's an actual human

954
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:23,320
being who has done some amazing iphone

955
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:27,450
work but when his career changes and he

956
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:29,950
no longer hacks or she no longer hacks

957
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:32,770
SCADA systems and he no longer hacks

958
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:36,129
iPhones they remain actual people you

959
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:37,690
are actual people you may be famous for

960
00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:40,360
something a lot of people think of means

961
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:42,100
the 'besides guy but or the beardy guy

962
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:45,910
but there's there's actually somebody

963
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:47,920
under all the layers of crap you're a

964
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:50,440
person you know stuff you hack manage

965
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,880
your employer these things apply if you

966
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:53,350
want to talk about this as a manager

967
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:55,570
employer we can we can do that offline

968
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:57,580
but two questions you have too many

969
00:45:55,570 --> 00:46:03,520
qualified and trained employees and is

970
00:45:57,580 --> 00:46:08,380
it easy hiring the people you need too

971
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:10,240
many words let's let's skip it so

972
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:13,410
basically if you don't have any control

973
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:16,089
over your environment you get stressed

974
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:19,089
if you don't understand why things are

975
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:20,620
happening you get stressed if you're at

976
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:22,390
a company and you're a manager and

977
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:24,339
you're going through an IPO and you have

978
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:25,779
all of these bright young faces that are

979
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:27,700
relatively fresh out of school and

980
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:28,990
they've never been through an IPO you

981
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:32,919
need to sit him down and say we're going

982
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:34,990
to do some really dumb because we

983
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:40,120
want to make Wall Street happy not int

984
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:42,629
not sentient human beings was a little

985
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,630
blunt Jack

986
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:50,860
so collectiveness my first real tangent

987
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:53,290
collective nouns right so a bunch of

988
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:56,110
cattle is a herd and a bunch of sheep is

989
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:58,570
a flock my favorite one is a gathering

990
00:46:56,110 --> 00:47:01,720
of crows is a murder you know what you

991
00:46:58,570 --> 00:47:02,390
call the a feral gathering of Vice

992
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:09,620
President

993
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:12,740
an IPO some of you are going to laugh

994
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:15,859
until you weep on that one provide

995
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:18,200
feedback manage workloads let people

996
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:20,080
disconnect maybe for sit VW actually

997
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:22,549
forces people to disconnect in Germany

998
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:24,590
if they turn off access to email

999
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:27,350
overnight for some employees offer

1000
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:29,990
education it's worth reciting the old

1001
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:31,700
joke of you know two executives talking

1002
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:33,560
about training budget but what if we

1003
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:38,600
train them and they leave what if we

1004
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:40,279
don't train them and they stay I travel

1005
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:41,900
a lot I get to have fun traveling

1006
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:43,850
because I have an awesome job some of

1007
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:46,190
your road warriors road warrior gets

1008
00:47:43,850 --> 00:47:50,750
tiring even if you have an awesome job

1009
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:54,080
but you can make it suck less the trick

1010
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:56,390
is you've got to venture out the problem

1011
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:58,660
of venturing out is that you don't

1012
00:47:56,390 --> 00:48:02,509
always know whether it's safe or not now

1013
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:04,549
sometimes you will find yourself in a

1014
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:07,100
neighborhood where the crows are

1015
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:12,350
carrying knives and have ankle bracelets

1016
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:14,089
on it's like oh I think I think I

1017
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:16,759
will have that terrible burger at the

1018
00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:19,430
Courtyard Cafe rather than venture out

1019
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:22,250
but if you do venture out you know my

1020
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:23,930
tip is in against life's not fair to

1021
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:25,670
women but single women wandering into

1022
00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:27,589
bars alone is not always a great idea

1023
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:29,300
but you know one of my things is I make

1024
00:48:27,590 --> 00:48:31,010
friends with bartenders everywhere I go

1025
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:33,530
because bartenders tend to be

1026
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:35,570
well-connected and underpaid and they

1027
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:37,610
will give you some great tips for where

1028
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:40,040
to get good food and drink at a

1029
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:42,260
reasonable price and how to avoid

1030
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:43,640
tourists or also what the most touristy

1031
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:46,490
things are if you do

1032
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:48,859
nobody hydrates enough their whole books

1033
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:50,689
on how to travel well but drink more

1034
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:54,320
water everything you do is dehydrating

1035
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:55,820
when you fly my doctors swears by always

1036
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:57,740
taking antihistamines before you fly

1037
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:59,570
even if you're not snuffly that way

1038
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:02,359
you're not likely to get snuffly you're

1039
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:04,100
not going to have any Nate you know less

1040
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:05,750
likely to pick up something if you're

1041
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:08,600
here in the Northeast if you have dry

1042
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:11,750
heat a little sailing you don't have to

1043
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:15,350
netipot but a little sailing keep your

1044
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:16,130
nostrils nasal passages moisturized they

1045
00:49:15,350 --> 00:49:17,089
won't dry out a

1046
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:20,780
crack when you get in the airplane

1047
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:26,500
you're less likely to pick up you funk

1048
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:29,060
from airplanes quickly helping others

1049
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:30,770
you're not a professional but you can be

1050
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:33,830
a friend you can be appear you can be a

1051
00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:35,360
mentor you can help people through do it

1052
00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:37,130
for yourself do it for them do it for

1053
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:38,600
whatever reason when I was young I

1054
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:39,380
wanted everybody to do things for the

1055
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,900
right reason

1056
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:43,550
now you can be an egotistical bastard

1057
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:45,680
and if that's why you do good for the

1058
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:47,180
world I'm okay with it I'd still prefer

1059
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:49,190
you were a good person but that's

1060
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:52,310
alright whatever but back to that

1061
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:54,890
original slide if you're not in a good

1062
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:57,230
place you can't help others and don't

1063
00:49:54,890 --> 00:49:59,150
try to and if you're in a bad place and

1064
00:49:57,230 --> 00:50:02,090
this is getting off fob way off topic

1065
00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:03,470
even for me you know like some of you

1066
00:50:02,090 --> 00:50:05,000
may have discovered this you get into

1067
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:06,680
relationships trying to fix people

1068
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,550
that's because you're broken too and

1069
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:14,330
neither of you is going to come out

1070
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:15,770
alright I don't have time and I'm

1071
00:50:14,330 --> 00:50:17,150
getting close we're going to wrap it up

1072
00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:22,550
but I'm going to go off on a tangent now

1073
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:23,090
so I'm going to yeah yeah back up there

1074
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:25,730
we go

1075
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:28,910
so I'm single for the first time in my

1076
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:30,290
life since I was fifteen right so I'm

1077
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:32,720
trying to reenter the dating game and

1078
00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:34,279
it's really kind of rough and I try to

1079
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,870
use pickup lines that are like

1080
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:39,200
age-appropriate and honest and I'm

1081
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:43,029
having no luck it just doesn't work it's

1082
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:43,029
like wow I bet you used to be hot

1083
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:52,270

1085
00:50:52,270 --> 00:51:07,480
you've got a lot of baggage no no would

1086
00:50:58,539 --> 00:51:09,190
you like to be my future Widow yeah I've

1087
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:15,880
had even less success with dear the

1088
00:51:09,190 --> 00:51:18,099
daughter is that wrong all right I'm

1089
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:19,690
gonna waste more time so you know one of

1090
00:51:18,099 --> 00:51:21,640
the things I've realized is talking to

1091
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:24,220
people who are dating in their 40s and

1092
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:26,170
50s and 60s like everybody has a

1093
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:29,500
psychotic ex-boyfriend or ex-girlfriend

1094
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:32,130
and I don't write because I was in a

1095
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:35,020
wonderful relationship for 40-plus years

1096
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:39,549
which means I have a psychotic future

1097
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:50,259
girlfriend I'm sitting in the bar it's

1098
00:51:39,549 --> 00:51:53,140
like you could be the one again back to

1099
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:54,670
the wisdom of Bob Dylan sometimes just

1100
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:56,558
listening to people is all it takes we

1101
00:51:54,670 --> 00:51:58,420
need to de-stress the hardcore burnout

1102
00:51:56,559 --> 00:52:00,940
stuff a lot of people just needed to

1103
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:02,559
vent and you know you steer them so I'm

1104
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:04,119
going to close with story about knowing

1105
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:05,289
what's important to you so one of the

1106
00:52:04,119 --> 00:52:06,849
things it's obvious is if you're a

1107
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:08,940
guitarist your guitar is important to

1108
00:52:06,849 --> 00:52:08,940
you

1109
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:21,779
[Music]

1110
00:52:16,730 --> 00:52:27,630
in the winter of 1949 BB King is a

1111
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:30,390
Gibson Lucille variant you can buy from

1112
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:32,910
Gibson he was playing King was playing

1113
00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:34,620

together the heating system that they

1116
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:42,240
used was 55-gallon metal drum with top

1117
00:52:40,110 --> 00:52:44,640
cutoff half filled with kerosene like

1118
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:47,089
the kerosene fire comes up everybody

1119
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:49,740
dances around at the bands on one side

1120

two guys start fighting they knock it

1121
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:55,229
over so we have a bear wood building

1124
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:05,790
poured across the wood technical term

1125
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:09,060
for this is bad the entire Hall goes up

1126

with the band of the car realizes he

1128
00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:17,009
left his brand-new 35 dollar guitar

1129
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:17,490
inside the hall so he ran back in and

1130
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:19,500
got it

1131
00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:21,810
got it out they got in the car and drove

1132
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:23,970
away getting ready for the next night

1133
00:53:21,810 --> 00:53:26,330

was two guys fighting over a woman and

1135
00:53:26,330 --> 00:53:32,910
the woman's name was Lucille and a

1136

others were injured and he named that

1139
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:42,570
guitar Lucille to remind himself to

1140
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:45,090
never do anything that's stupid again

1141
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:46,830

like this that have his signature on him

1145
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:54,899
and every one of them is a real Lucille

1146
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:57,030
but he didn't need a guitar I mean he's

1147
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:59,160
a guitar he didn't need that one guitar

1148
00:53:57,030 --> 00:54:01,950
when I granted being one of the best

1149
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:03,420
guitar players in human history he can

1150
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:06,149
pick up pretty much anything and do it

1151
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:08,820
but he committed himself I need a guitar

1152
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:11,490
I want this style I want NES 355 for the

1153
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:13,650
guitar nerds 355 is the stereo version

1154
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:15,569
of the 335 he's one of the few big

1155
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:17,670
commercial artists that had commercial

1156
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:19,680
success of a stereo guitar but that's

1157
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:22,230
why some of his stuff when you listen to

1158
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:25,319
it is the way it is he's playing a

1159
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:27,270
stereo electric guitar but anyway you

1160
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:28,650
know BB King you know you see some

1161
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:29,319
people like Dick Dale to play the same

1162
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:31,660
axe for

1163
00:54:29,319 --> 00:54:32,529
50 years Owen makes sense because that's

1164
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:34,359
a hand-built

1165
00:54:32,529 --> 00:54:38,349
thing leo fender built dick dale's

1166
00:54:34,359 --> 00:54:40,420
guitar for him but BB King didn't need a

1167
00:54:38,349 --> 00:54:43,390
specific guitar he knew it was important

1168
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:47,170
not being dead in a fire was important

1169
00:54:43,390 --> 00:54:50,440
again hopefully it doesn't take any of

1170
00:54:47,170 --> 00:54:53,079
the abuses that I've just given you so

1171
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:56,109
sources know these are sources of stress

1172
00:54:53,079 --> 00:54:57,519
let's talk about a few sources if you're

1173
00:54:56,109 --> 00:54:59,499
interested in this ping me I'll share

1174
00:54:57,519 --> 00:55:01,149
some stuff with you American

1175
00:54:59,499 --> 00:55:02,859
Psychological Association it's sort of

1176
00:55:01,150 --> 00:55:05,499
pop psychology but every year they do a

1177
00:55:02,859 --> 00:55:06,940
study on stress in America new topic or

1178
00:55:05,499 --> 00:55:07,779
theme every year some good information

1179
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:09,910
in there

1180
00:55:07,779 --> 00:55:11,789
Christina Maas Locke did this I'm going

1181
00:55:09,910 --> 00:55:14,319
to work on this with Michael Leiter

1182
00:55:11,789 --> 00:55:16,119
Robert Sapolsky has done a lot of

1183
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:17,739
interesting stuff some of his stuff gets

1184
00:55:16,119 --> 00:55:21,699
a little crunchy granola for me but

1185
00:55:17,739 --> 00:55:23,619
that's all right and then a handful of

1186
00:55:21,699 --> 00:55:25,509
podcasts recent southern-fried security

1187
00:55:23,619 --> 00:55:29,739
and rally security podcasts have touched

1188
00:55:25,509 --> 00:55:32,289
on on stress and burnout and that is not

1189
00:55:29,739 --> 00:55:33,999
the end that's the end of my talk I

1190
00:55:32,289 --> 00:55:35,049
think we're pretty much out of time but

1191
00:55:33,999 --> 00:55:37,538
if you want to catch me I'll be around

1192
00:55:35,049 --> 00:55:39,130
this evenings afternoon I'm easy to find

1193
00:55:37,539 --> 00:55:41,440
on that internet thing but there's a lot

1194
00:55:39,130 --> 00:55:43,569
more good content and after the day is

1195
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:45,759
over you continue with the conversations

1196
00:55:43,569 --> 00:55:47,979
and connections that you've made here

1197
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:50,849
today and have a great time and enjoy

1198
00:55:47,979 --> 00:55:50,848
the rest of b-sides

1199
00:55:56,120 --> 00:56:03,920
Oh Oh unofficial endorsement there's

1200
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:05,690
this book I don't agree with it the

1201
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:10,010
whole point of the subtle art of not

1202
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:12,800
giving a is he teaches you do not give

1203
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:16,460
any and then choose very wisely where

1204
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:18,680
you spin to them so they it's a spoiler

1205
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:20,330
alert it's not about not giving any it's

1206
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:23,990
about giving them only when they matter

1207
00:56:20,330 --> 00:56:27,799
so it we also have a little gift for

1208
00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:30,589
Jack Oh bartender he said so we actually

1209
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:33,160
