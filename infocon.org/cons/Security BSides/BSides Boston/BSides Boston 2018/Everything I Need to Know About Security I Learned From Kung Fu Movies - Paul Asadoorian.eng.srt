00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,459
cyber security

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,680
no okay

8
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:20,189
Paul's been in information security

9
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:22,259
first over 15 years you may already know

10
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:24,380
Paul because of security weekly and

11
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:28,320
that's going on it's 12 year now

00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:30,000
publications and Paul will always be in

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,130
information security whether he wants to

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,860
or not because he's got three young boys

15
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:37,350
and as they grow up you can be sure

16
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,149
they're going to test his capabilities

17
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,790
as a story about that there's a story

18
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:44,129

22
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,989
welcome everyone so Patrick asked me at

23
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:56,399
the last moment to give a talk and I'm

24
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:58,468
like well I happen to put this one

25
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,300
together I'm like it's not kung-fu one

26
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:04,320
it's like yeah that'll work

27
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:08,070
so here I am and welcome how many people

28
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:10,169
here have children show a hands like

29
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,210
that you know of like I always give

30
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,170
people like I don't know how to to

31
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:16,320
answer that

32
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:19,049
so Tom said I have three boys and my

33
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,389
oldest son Brayden is the best hacker

34
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:23,310
and social engineer in the world I know

35
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,960
you if you have children you might think

36
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:28,350
that your child is and we can debate

37
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,240
that after the talk but here's why so

38
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:32,399
the date of when all these events

39
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,570
occurred is April 2nd and that's very

40
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,210
critical to the story

41
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:38,100
this is April 2nd I have all three boys

42
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:40,289
by myself and I'm watching the boys and

43
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,908
you make this promise to yourself when

44
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,500
you're watching three small children

45
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:45,479
that you're knocking to yell or raise

46
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,970
your voice and your ridiculous things

47
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:50,158
but inevitably it happens that you're

48
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:52,798
yelling ridiculous things like don't put

49
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:56,549
that life open your mouth or you have to

50
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,290
repair to the table it's just ridiculous

51
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:00,689
so I had one of those moments when I

52
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:03,299
opened up the cabinet and I found a

53
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:04,829
gallon of milk in the cabinet and of

54
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:06,990
course I yelled one of those ridiculous

55
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:09,720
things why is there milk in the cabinet

56
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,489
and my son Brandon's like I don't know

57
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,819
he's like mom you know how crazy mommy

58
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:14,560
is like you know

59
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:15,909
could have just ended up there she

60
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,299
thought it was the refrigerator she's

61
00:02:15,909 --> 00:02:21,340
like she's not and so oh my god so I

62
00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:23,170
called my wife I'm like did you put the

63
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,519
milk in the cabinet she's like what are

64
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,958
you choose I got you all right do I need

65
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,859
to come home because I'm really worried

66
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:28,359
about you right now

67
00:02:26,859 --> 00:02:30,519
Michael there's a gallon of milk in the

68
00:02:28,359 --> 00:02:31,840
cabinet and she's like you're crazy you

69
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:33,730
put the milk I'm like no I didn't put

70
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,319
the milk in the cabinet no one wanted to

71
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:37,869
enough to it I'm like all right well I

72
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:40,780
kind of brushed it off as an anomaly so

73
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:45,010
then I get all my children ready to go

74
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:46,569
out and about 2 or 3 hours later but

75
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:48,010
it's those of you that have kids know

76
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:50,040
exactly what I'm talking about

77
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:53,198
we get ready to get into the car and

78
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:56,560
when I open the door so that I have a

79
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:58,209
almost nine is Brayden four-year-old in

80
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,120
a ten-month-old and holding the little

81
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:04,840
one and I open the door and there is

82
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:07,239
poop on the child seat and I'm like in

83
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,370
my house it's not uncommon to see poop

84
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:11,590
like it happens in our house quite a bit

85
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:13,120
actually if it looks like poop and it

86
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:15,010
probably smells like I mean it's poop

87
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,569
right so when I open the door my guys

88
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:18,638
definitely cool I'm a hula hoop in the

89
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:20,798
car again I'm yelling ridiculous things

90
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:21,430
who will let poop on the child see in

91
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:23,859
the car

92
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:25,599
brains like I got there I don't know

93
00:03:23,859 --> 00:03:28,030
what you're talking about and then I

94
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:31,060
look at it and I'm like it's definitely

95
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:32,829
fake poop I'm like get in the car and I

96
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,599
call my wife I'm like did you eat poop

97
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:36,669
in the car she's like right now really

98
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:38,918
I'm coming home now you're not allowed

99
00:03:36,669 --> 00:03:41,500
to watch the children anymore my god it

100
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:44,349
was like pooping and then like it dawns

101
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:46,239
on me and I have to embrace in his not

102
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:48,608
he's not owning up to anything I mean he

103
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,079
is straight-faced not even laughing when

104
00:03:48,609 --> 00:03:52,449
I'm talking he's straight face the whole

105
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:55,599
time and finally I have to sit all

106
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:56,709
children down and say all right who's

107
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,929
behind all of this

108
00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:02,049
and no one's owning up to it I'm like

109
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:05,290
I'm turning the Wi-Fi off until some for

110
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:07,180
everyone until someone confesses my

111
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:10,358
four-year-old is hitting grading with

112
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:13,299
his iPad will you just confess I want

113
00:04:10,359 --> 00:04:15,009
Wi-Fi and finally Brading confesses

114
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:16,539
suddenly dude how did you do that

115
00:04:15,009 --> 00:04:18,909
like first how did you keep a straight

116
00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:20,560
face secondly how did you get the milk

117
00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:22,029
in the cabinet with no one looking now

118
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,830
haven't got to answer that one like

119
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:25,330
you're going to tell me how did you make

120
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,930
the fake poop because I mean you can see

121
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,030
the picture

122
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:30,669
like you would think that's poop right

123
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:32,830
no it's raspberry applesauce that he

124
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:35,349
found in the backseat of the car with a

125
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:37,240
piece of cardboard and fabricated we

126
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:39,669
also have four dogs I know we're insane

127
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:42,430
and we have a puppy in fabric I'm like

128
00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:45,130
dude I'm so proud of you right now we've

129
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:46,780
got it's so awesome when people ask me

130
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:48,400
like why do you give this talk and try

131
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:50,440
and draw inspiration for hacking from

132
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:54,400
hacker movies I gotta keep up with my

133
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:57,160
son Brayden so Tom kind of went over all

134
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,479
this I actually did study kung fu for

135
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,310
about ten years I'm starting to get my

136
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:03,190
kids back into it and I've watched like

137
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:04,720
a lot of kung fu movies I don't know if

138
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:06,400
you already use giffy in the flacc

139
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,889
channel or puts up like images and

140
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,989
sometimes it's like a movie like scene

141
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:13,150
from a kung fu movie I'm like I have

142
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:15,310
that movie and they're like nah ah in my

143
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:17,830
employees in my studio I'm like go in

144
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:18,250
the corner and in the DVD rack and it's

145
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,630
there

146
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,039
they're like wow that's kind of

147
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:23,590
impressive actually so I've watched a

148
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,810
lot of kung fu movies so I was sitting

149
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:28,150
there so this is my standard disclaimer

150
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:30,099
that I put it all my my slides so if I

151
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:31,500
like swear or put up an image or

152
00:05:30,099 --> 00:05:33,789
something and you're easily offended

153
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,680
that could happen not so much with this

154
00:05:33,789 --> 00:05:38,469
song at the two o'clock talk though you

155
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,909
want to watch out for that so I was

156
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:41,770
sitting there watching kung fu movies

157
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:43,930
and I'm like there's a lot of stuff in

158
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:45,669
here that really like relates and I

159
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:47,710
started making a list and the list

160
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:49,448
started growing and I was like why I

161
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:51,219
think I have enough for a talk so I

162
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:54,130
broke it down into categories the

163
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:56,139
student in the teacher dynamic security

164
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:58,570
and kung-fu tactics political and social

165
00:05:56,139 --> 00:06:00,820
some other interesting ridiculous things

166
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:03,130
and then of course I'm like well I have

167
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:04,750
to share like my top 10 list of kung fu

168
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:08,139
movies that you have to watch before you

169
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:09,849
die so all right the first is the

170
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:11,650
student-teacher dynamic and what I like

171
00:06:09,849 --> 00:06:14,349
about this segment is it talks about how

172
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:16,330
to get into the security industry and

173
00:06:14,349 --> 00:06:18,849
one of the things that you would do is

174
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:21,219
find a mentor I don't know if Keith hood

175
00:06:18,849 --> 00:06:24,580
is here in this room is he here in this

176
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:25,990
room okay find him he runs a project

177
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:28,060
along those lines which I'll talk about

178
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:30,099
and I was like wow there's really like a

179
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:33,759
good parallel between a kung fu teacher

180
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:35,130
and your mentor in security okay so now

181
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,110
here's the audience-participation

182
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:39,670
segment of the presentation when I

183
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:41,830
present these sides with the numbers

184
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:44,410
and it's a fact about a kung-fu movie

185
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:48,909
everyone in the audience needs to say in

186
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:55,750
the console movies all right you guys

187
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:57,820
get right 1 2 3 ok your master will be a

188
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:59,620
hermit living in the woods and reluctant

189
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,969
to train you there's a lot of reasons

190
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:03,190
for this

191
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:05,110
that they are reclusive from society

192
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:07,090
mostly because they don't want to a lot

193
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:09,280
of the storylines go they taught a

194
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:10,989
student and that student ended up doing

195
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,309
bad things with their training and

196
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:16,000
therefore they want to go live in the

197
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:17,410
woods so no one finds them and they hide

198
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,030
their skills right they don't want

199
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:20,560
everyone to know that there are kung-fu

200
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:22,330
master because then people will show up

201
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,250
outside their doorstep and be like hey

202
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:28,330
can you teach me kung fu so they also

203
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:31,240
hide their skills in the computer and

204
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:33,219
hacking world it's the same level of

205
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,500
responsibility right if I teach people

206
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:37,630
how to hack into things and break into

207
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,850
things that's the responsibility that I

208
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:41,409
have that I teach the right people then

209
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:43,300
is a responsibility the person that I've

210
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:45,400
taught to make sure that they don't do

211
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:50,710
evil things so it's a very similar

212
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:53,409
parallel also learning computer security

213
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:54,849
whether offense or defense or both it's

214
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:56,290
really hard you have to have a lot of

215
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:58,660
background and a lot of different

216
00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:00,880
technologies to understand how to break

217
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:03,550
into systems understand complex systems

218
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:05,110
and if I'm going to spend the time with

219
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,970
someone I want to make sure they stick

220
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:09,220
with it and that's another reason why

221
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:11,590
kung-fu teachers will be very reluctant

222
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,730
to train people is that they want to

223
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,810
make sure that they're going to stick

224
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:17,820
with it they're going to be able to

225
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:20,080
endure all of that hard work now

226
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:21,610
fortunately for us we don't have to go

227
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,229
out in the woods and seek out a kung-fu

228
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,760
master also that'd be really cool though

229
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,720
right like hey today we're going to

230
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,330
woods and we're going to find some of

231
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,370
the teachers hacking you can now you can

232
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:33,549
just go to a website it's InfoSec

233
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:36,130
mentors dotnet keys close it and Jimmy

234
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:37,630
will run that site today this stems from

235
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:40,479
a project that came out of a besides

236
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:41,679
conference a long time ago Jimmy and

237
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,440
Keith have taken over the project

238
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:47,620
they've built an entirely new website

239
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:49,840
you can go there and it's kind of like a

240
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:51,940
dating site for information security

241
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,500
professionals is the best way to put it

242
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:55,030
I don't think Keith read likes it when I

243
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,890
print it like that but I'm like dude you

244
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:58,870
kind of built like a dating site because

245
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:00,850
I could register on there and I say I

246
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:02,830
want to mentor someone and someone can

247
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:05,200
say hey I want to be mentored and then

248
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:07,240
we list our individual skills skills you

249
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,490
want to learn skills I want to teach and

250
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,140
then they match us together and then we

251
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:12,190
can like hold hands and go for walks on

252
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:15,910
the beach and I can tell you about

253
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:18,670
Metasploit so fans also has a mentorship

254
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:21,459
program as well it's not as romantic as

255
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:23,770
implementers net but it does allow you

256
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:26,170
to take a class with sans learn some

257
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:32,590
stuff and then help other people with

258
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:34,390
that as well so yeah so again with the

259
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:35,950
communications you know again you don't

260
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:38,830
have to go out in the woods and find a

261
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:41,020
computer teacher I mean a kung-fu

262
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:42,460
teacher you can just go online and

263
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:44,439
there's lots of ways you can communicate

264
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:46,750
with your mentor today right we don't

265
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:49,330
have to go live in the woods for 10

266
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:50,920
years and learn kung-fu we can

267
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:53,590
communicate with our mentor in any

268
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:56,979
number of different ways right we can do

269
00:09:53,590 --> 00:10:00,940
IRC and if you're old like me or slack

270
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:03,850
if you're not so old and do that social

271
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:06,400
in interaction with everyone and mentor

272
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:09,280
people in our field and I encourage you

273
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:11,140
if you're not like if you're just

274
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:13,329
getting into the field but you know some

275
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:14,800
stuff like he's like I know some

276
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:16,390
security stuff but my background is

277
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,709
really web programming like dude that's

278
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:19,600
awesome like I want to learn web

279
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:21,010
programming and I'll teach you some

280
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,660
security stuff and he's like yeah I'll

281
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:25,060
teach you some you know web programming

282
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:27,790
stuff so you don't have to be an expert

283
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:34,109
kung-fu master to go on there and take

284
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:38,329
advantage of the site okay so now in the

285
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:38,330
all right all together now one two three

286
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:45,720
your master will be drunk and punish you

287
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:48,209
for taking shortcuts how now the drunk

288
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,340
part will get you so more importantly

289
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:51,930
you will be punished for taking short

290
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:53,880
now in the comfortable movies there are

291
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:55,439
all kinds of like it looks like a

292
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,300
bondage film I know when you put that

293
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,280
stuff out there it's really not it's

294
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:01,800
actually mimicking kung fu training and

295
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,990
you think it's ridiculous right until I

296
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,640
watched that movie right there that I

297
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:08,460
can't remember the name top of my head I

298
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:10,590
apologize but he's made to do push-ups

299
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:12,330
warning mantis style kung fu right you

300
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:14,460
have to have really strong fingers so

301
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:16,290
he's doing push-ups on his fingers and

302
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:18,750
he would get tired and his palms would

303
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:21,689
fall and so the teacher put eggs

304
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:23,400
underneath his hands and then his palms

305
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:25,020
would fall and squish the eggs and he

306
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,120
couldn't eat them so he had to get

307
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:29,189
stronger if he wanted to eat the eggs if

308
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,320
he tried to take the Masters eggs or

309
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:32,550
steak or whatever the master would like

310
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,670
fight them off with his chopsticks

311
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:36,859
awesome so I mean that was incentive

312
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:39,000
like food is a good incentive

313
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:41,520
fortunately for us in computer security

314
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,680
we can still eat and learn hacking

315
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:47,310
that's cool but not in the kung-fu

316
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:49,890
movies so and after I watched that film

317
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:51,479
I went to my own kung fu class and I

318
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:52,890
always wanted to learn mantis style and

319
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,720
then my teacher is like we have to start

320
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:55,890
doing push-ups on your fingers and I'm

321
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,930
like you're not going to put eggs under

322
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:59,790
my hands are you can see what he's like

323
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:04,349
stop watching those ridiculous movies

324
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:06,560
William so short cuts lead to a lot of

325
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:09,660
really bad things on the defensive side

326
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,790
short cuts lead to exposures in our

327
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:15,839
network and that can manifest itself in

328
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:16,860
a number of different ways what in one

329
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,570
of the ways I think in the

330
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:21,390
teacher-student dynamic that I like to

331
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:24,380
use because everyone should use VI and

332
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:28,590
if you use Emacs don't talk to me but if

333
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:30,570
so if using a real editor like VI my

334
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:35,640
great story is when I was learning Linux

335
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:39,090
in like 1998 or so 97 it was like Red

336
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:40,980
Hat 500 ish timeframe is when I first

337
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:42,540
started learning Linux and my friend

338
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,100
that worked as a programmer with me for

339
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:46,620
the company I was working for in college

340
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,210
he had learned Linux in school like

341
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,800
that's

342
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:50,360
but they don't have Linux and I went to

343
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,620
Bryant University at the time there

344
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,720
wasn't much Linux there and then this

345
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:56,360
was a long time ago because I'm old and

346
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,740
so we started teaching me Linux and my

347
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,780
dude I really want to learn like I see

348
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:01,700
you in this editor dude and like you're

349
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:03,740
doing amazing things like your hands are

350
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,540
moving and like text is moving all over

351
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,980
the place and edit so I'm like dude I

352
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:08,780
gotta learn that I'm like that's awesome

353
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,370
so he's just reach out in front of the

354
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:13,010
eye and I go back to my little like

355
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:15,620
arrow keys and he literally hits my hand

356
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:18,530
I was like what are you doing he's like

357
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:20,930
never use the arrow keys in VI he's like

358
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:23,030
always use the keys so that your hands

359
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:25,760
never have to leap so after much

360
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:28,490
training and practice I never use the

361
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,990
arrow keys again and I was much better

362
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:32,420
in the other I could type faster I could

363
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:34,100
edit faster so that's kind of like a

364
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:36,380
crossover between like learning from a

365
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:39,140
kung-fu teacher and learning you know

366
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:40,610
computers and security well the other

367
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:42,680
thing you know where shortcuts will

368
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:44,480
getcha is in a pen test or vulnerability

369
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,310
assessment now granted we have a limited

370
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,630
amount of time however don't take

371
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:48,949
shortcuts when you're assessing the

372
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:50,780
security of someone's network obviously

373
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:54,130
you're going to miss something that

374
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:56,990
could be the bad things happening later

375
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:58,970
so one of the the interesting things

376
00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:01,970
that people tend to take in shortcuts

377
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:04,040
that I've noticed I'm a non faculty

378
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:06,170
member I also talk about a lot of people

379
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:08,390
in the community who are in various

380
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:10,130
levels in their organization of security

381
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:12,319
and when we start talking about a

382
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:13,790
solution a lot of times it comes down to

383
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,580
these things that are up on the screen

384
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:18,380
behind me and that is they're like well

385
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:20,510
I want to do into the response is a good

386
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:22,430
one I want to do some kind of endpoint

387
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:24,319
protection I want to do whatever you

388
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:26,540
want to do in security and I start

389
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,100
asking these questions I'm like so what

390
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:30,170
constitutes sensitive data in your

391
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:32,450
environment and what are the different

392
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:35,120
criticality criticality levels of that

393
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:37,370
data in your environment and who has

394
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,870
access to all of that data and where

395
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:40,370
does that data travel and like at this

396
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:41,480
point they're like oh my god that's so

397
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,770
much work I don't know what you're

398
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,360
talking about I know we just want to

399
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:46,520
take a shorter like can I just put like

400
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,380
a firewall and antivirus like no like

401
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:51,199
you really have to know that stuff in

402
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:53,510
order to effectively put measures in

403
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,220
place for security in your organization

404
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:58,189
if you don't you're taking a shortcut

405
00:14:55,220 --> 00:15:00,920
and what I've learned about this process

406
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:02,299
is one it's hard to

407
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:04,069
there are actually some vendor solutions

408
00:15:02,299 --> 00:15:05,629
if you talk to me after we can we can

409
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:07,639
talk about some of those

410
00:15:05,629 --> 00:15:09,769
we actually just took a sponsor on on

411
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:11,420
security weekly because they when I

412
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:13,369
started talking with them like wait you

413
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:14,238
help with this problem they're like yeah

414
00:15:13,369 --> 00:15:16,279
yeah we do

415
00:15:14,239 --> 00:15:17,959
I'm like good I know I want you as a

416
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:19,339
sponsor and then my other friend went to

417
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:20,689
work there which further validated it

418
00:15:19,339 --> 00:15:22,399
but if you want to talk about that

419
00:15:20,689 --> 00:15:23,449
comply going down after so there are

420
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,540
things that can help you with this

421
00:15:23,449 --> 00:15:28,608
process because it's hard but don't skip

422
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:31,639
it because it's a shortcut now back to

423
00:15:28,609 --> 00:15:34,519
drinking this is one of my good friends

424
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:38,509
passed out in a chair at DEFCON can

425
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:43,249
anyone identify the seemingly infamous

426
00:15:38,509 --> 00:15:45,410
person that is in this photo anyone no

427
00:15:43,249 --> 00:15:47,449
aside no I'm not there I wasn't there

428
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:48,709
for this one I was passed out on the

429
00:15:47,449 --> 00:15:51,589
other lounge chair on the other side of

430
00:15:48,709 --> 00:15:54,559
the pool anyone recognize this person

431
00:15:51,589 --> 00:15:56,959
right here as Jeff Moss the person who

432
00:15:54,559 --> 00:16:00,649
created Jeff Kahn and black hat this was

433
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:03,079
my friend chance to meet Jeff Moss who's

434
00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:06,319
a super super nice guy he's awesome and

435
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:10,069
this was his chance and he he drank too

436
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:12,259
much so when you mentor people in this

437
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:13,729
field make sure you tell them that yes

438
00:16:12,259 --> 00:16:15,910
when you go to conferences there will be

439
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:17,959
drinking I use this slide also when I

440
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:19,309
present them on security to high school

441
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:20,899
and college students as well when you're

442
00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:22,759
getting into it you got to be

443
00:16:20,899 --> 00:16:26,059
responsible and like don't miss your

444
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:26,989
chance to meet Jeff Moss and have I

445
00:16:26,059 --> 00:16:30,049
don't know if you can see if there is

446
00:16:26,989 --> 00:16:37,519
stuff written on his forehead as well so

447
00:16:30,049 --> 00:16:39,410
it's just saying okay now in the you can

448
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:42,199
learn kung-fu by getting your ass kicked

449
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:43,819
this is so awesome so we already talked

450
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:46,669
about how teachers don't want to teach

451
00:16:43,819 --> 00:16:48,529
you kung fu' right so one of the tactics

452
00:16:46,669 --> 00:16:50,179
that they would use in the movies is

453
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:52,549
they would just challenge them to a

454
00:16:50,179 --> 00:16:53,839
fight and if they resisted like they

455
00:16:52,549 --> 00:16:56,509
would just throw things at them and just

456
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,549
basically force them into a fight and as

457
00:16:56,509 --> 00:17:00,589
they were getting their ass handed to

458
00:16:58,549 --> 00:17:03,410
them they would take take mental notes

459
00:17:00,589 --> 00:17:04,730
like oh he's using this technique or

460
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:07,879
that see me and they would try and learn

461
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:10,039
kung fu while they were fighting now you

462
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,409
see this picture that's a chicken okay

463
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:14,869
in this movie Shaolin vs. Lama which is

464
00:17:12,409 --> 00:17:17,120
one of the greatest kung-fu flicks ever

465
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:19,869
he is bribing the teacher with a chicken

466
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,829
to get him to teach him kung fu

467
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:24,260
hopefully we don't have to bribe our

468
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:26,990
mentors with chickens to learn computers

469
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:30,020
and hacking but this can be a very

470
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:32,090
painful process so one of the questions

471
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:33,559
I asked many of our guests that come on

472
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:35,120
our show is how did you get your start

473
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:39,049
in security one of the more popular

474
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:40,729
answers is well I got hacked and I was

475
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:42,049
curious and I started looking into it

476
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:44,840
and I was like wow I can do this as a

477
00:17:42,049 --> 00:17:47,379
job so certainly you know that's been a

478
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:49,370
path for many people in our field is

479
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:51,590
getting hacked and having that

480
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:53,928
experience definitely breeds interest

481
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:55,820
and can get you into the field also you

482
00:17:53,929 --> 00:17:58,280
can do that in a formalized setting in

483
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:59,870
CCDC competitions which is great you can

484
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:03,860
be in the fire was involved with many of

485
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:05,299
them they're awesome so yes and getting

486
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:07,520
hacked shows you not how not to play

487
00:18:05,299 --> 00:18:09,889
defense right and you can learn now

488
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:12,500
short of like just putting up honeypot

489
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:13,909
systems are not patching your stuff and

490
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,860
coming to a conference and using the

491
00:18:13,909 --> 00:18:17,929
Wi-Fi like that's one way to learn how

492
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:20,840
to get hacked probably not the best idea

493
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:23,210
just saying you can go read about

494
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,590
breaches now I did not get a chance to

495
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:26,179
update I think Dave talked about the

496
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:28,070
shadow brokers release right and all the

497
00:18:26,179 --> 00:18:29,270
tools that's probably a little more

498
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:32,299
updated information

499
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:34,668
however this hack team breach they went

500
00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:36,590
into like excruciating details and

501
00:18:34,669 --> 00:18:39,169
exactly how they hacked the hacking

502
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:41,780
team's systems this is great you can

503
00:18:39,169 --> 00:18:43,460
learn how to get hacked just by reading

504
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:46,340
about it you don't have to have your own

505
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:47,720
systems get hacked like red hat 5 - when

506
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:52,309
you put it on the internet in the late

507
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:54,140
90s that would always get hacked I was

508
00:18:52,309 --> 00:18:56,030
trying to come up with a parallel to

509
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:59,809
this and I kind of just came up short

510
00:18:56,030 --> 00:19:02,059
but basically in China and especially

511
00:18:59,809 --> 00:19:03,710
specifically in Taiwan my teacher would

512
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:06,049
tell me this story my teachers from

513
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:07,490
Taiwan and he would say you know there

514
00:19:06,049 --> 00:19:09,500
was all these people that wanted to

515
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:12,320
learn kung fu there were more students

516
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:14,000
than there were teachers so at the local

517
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,830
school the conclude teacher would put up

518
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,809
a message board that said hey anyone

519
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:20,240
that wants to learn kung fu come into

520
00:19:17,809 --> 00:19:22,220
the auditorium after class so all like

521
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,380
100 students would come in the teacher

522
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:26,450
would walk out and say get in the horse

523
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:28,159
stance that's horse stance and everyone

524
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:28,880
get into horse stance and then he'd go

525
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:30,470
back and was off

526
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,390
he'd read the paper sip some tea come

527
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:34,250
out about 25 minutes later 30 minutes

528
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:34,730
later about half the people are long

529
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,310
gone

530
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:39,200
they're like screw that and so he's like

531
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:41,629
out still too many go back into his

532
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,330
office read more the paper sips tea come

533
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:46,490
out you know maybe there's like 20 or so

534
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:48,649
people he'd do that one more time come

535
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:50,440
out there'd be five people left still

536
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:53,000
standing in for stance after an hour

537
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,800
come back tomorrow to learn kungfu I

538
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,480
don't know that there's a power like

539
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,889
what would you do a ping this host or

540
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,240
hacking in this host until your fingers

541
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:01,820
fall off I don't know if there's a

542
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:04,550
parallel into computer security for that

543
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:06,590
and good thing we're not made to sit in

544
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:07,580
horse stance before we learn how to hack

545
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:12,919
okay

546
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:14,840
in the kung-fu masters have friendly

547
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,820
battles where they test each other's

548
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:19,310
skills this is a variation on the theme

549
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:21,950
I think it's best represented in the

550
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:24,800
film if man we're done again who

551
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:27,410
actually his mom trained here in Boston

552
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:29,720
actually in is a very well decorated

553
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:31,370
kung-fu master I'm kung fu teacher and

554
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,350
Donnie again actually trained here in

555
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:35,510
Boston for some time as well before he

556
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:36,830
went on to star movies with Jet Li so

557
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:41,000
I'm getting a little fun a tangent here

558
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:45,230
really back in so he plays it man is

559
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,960
very famous kung fu teacher and when the

560
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:50,810
in the first movie he is challenged by a

561
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:52,490
master and it's very clear that Donnie

562
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:54,530
yen's character it man is more skilled

563
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:56,030
in kung fu but they fight in the other

564
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:58,040
teacher fights and they're testing each

565
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:59,840
other skills right because you go off

566
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,520
and you learn all of this stuff whether

567
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,560
you're learning kung fu whether you're

568
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,180
learning hacking and you're like I get

569
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:07,399
to test this stuff out in the real world

570
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:09,380
I get to see if it actually works

571
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,180
so kung fu teachers would challenge each

572
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:13,280
other to duels they wouldn't hurt each

573
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:15,470
other right they would able to be a

574
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,940
friendly fight to see where they were at

575
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:19,100
with their skills so they knew what they

576
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:22,010
had to work on you can do the same thing

577
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:23,659
in computer hacking right you know the

578
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:26,000
lesson is like boards don't hit back

579
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:27,680
right you want a more realistic training

580
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,360
environment than just putting up a

581
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,010
vulnerable host in your lab sure that's

582
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,610
one thing but you're not actually doing

583
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:36,620
that in the real world so here's where I

584
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:38,659
want you to challenge yourself I want

585
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:39,409
you to number one don't be afraid of a

586
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:42,740
capture the flag

587
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:44,240
right very different from I set up

588
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:46,429
you know a vulnerable system in my lab

589
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,250
and I'm breaking into it too I'm in a

590
00:21:46,429 --> 00:21:51,260
live fire hacking environment in a CTF I

591
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:53,750
have a team and I have to apply my

592
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:55,908
skills so definitely do that indoor I

593
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:57,440
think people get intimidated like I got

594
00:21:55,909 --> 00:21:59,330
to know how to code an assembly and

595
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,190
write exploits in order to do a CTF no

596
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:03,740
you don't you can go and learn and test

597
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:05,809
your skills and it's okay you'll come

598
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:09,260
out of that with what you have to

599
00:22:05,809 --> 00:22:11,330
improve on in your skill set right and I

600
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:13,730
also encourage people to take classes

601
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:15,320
that are above maybe above your skill

602
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:16,970
level if you're like I don't know if I'm

603
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,918
skilled enough like that's the purpose

604
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:22,190
of the class is to teach you that stuff

605
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:23,210
now if you don't have Linux fundamentals

606
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:25,039
down

607
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:26,690
don't take a class on exploit

608
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,700
development okay like there's limits

609
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:30,020
here take a class on Linux and learn

610
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,820
Linux you could probably get people to

611
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:33,080
teach your Linux for free we're trying

612
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:35,240
to actually putting together a free

613
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,889
seminar for my employees who are not

614
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,659
security people they're media production

615
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:40,309
folks but I've told them they have to

616
00:22:38,659 --> 00:22:41,960
learn Linux there's much of our code

617
00:22:40,309 --> 00:22:44,000
base runs on Linux it runs our podcasts

618
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,289
because I wrote a lot of it and so

619
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,570
they're going to take Linux for in it

620
00:22:45,289 --> 00:22:49,129
once you get the foundation then you can

621
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:51,649
start testing your skill level they get

622
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:53,840
the foundation first the other thing is

623
00:22:51,649 --> 00:22:56,750
speaking of free stuff attacking

624
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:59,240
challenges go to holiday hack challenge

625
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:02,120
calm all the links that are on there my

626
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:04,070
good friend ed SCOTUS has given away all

627
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:06,139
these hacking challenges for free you

628
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:08,090
can go download them you can do every

629
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:09,950
single individual it's like an

630
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:11,360
individual capture-the-flag event like

631
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:14,510
he gives you some files and you have to

632
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:17,120
decode them and decrypt them figure out

633
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:19,010
puzzles and do hacking along the way all

634
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,510
of those are completely free you can

635
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:23,450
leave this presentation and go do these

636
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:25,490
today for absolutely $0 and they're all

637
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:27,260
available there they're available as

638
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:29,149
challenges and the answers are there in

639
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:30,890
the entire archive of I think there's

640
00:23:29,149 --> 00:23:33,020
seven or eight of them the ED has done

641
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:34,970
and he does one every year the last

642
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:37,789
couple have been holiday hack challenges

643
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:40,130
which involve a video game on a website

644
00:23:37,789 --> 00:23:42,950
and all that stuff but they're all out

645
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:45,200
there for free okay so that's the

646
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:51,100
teaching stuff now we're going to talk

647
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:51,100
about security and kung-fu cactus in the

648
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:58,379
if you are in a restaurant there is a

649
00:23:54,990 --> 00:24:00,690
100% chance that you will be in a fight

650
00:23:58,379 --> 00:24:02,009
and it was watching kung fu movie and

651
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:03,600
then like they're walking in the

652
00:24:02,009 --> 00:24:05,129
restaurant like thank god there's going

653
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,168
to be a fight scene and like before I

654
00:24:05,129 --> 00:24:08,610
get the words out of my mouth someone's

655
00:24:07,169 --> 00:24:09,990
like throwing a chopstick at someone

656
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:11,850
else and like a huge fight breaks out

657
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:14,429
it's awesome I just don't know when

658
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:15,779
everyone eats and I didn't I started

659
00:24:14,429 --> 00:24:17,820
thinking about like why is it in the

660
00:24:15,779 --> 00:24:19,649
restaurant I think it's because in a

661
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:21,990
restaurant setting there's lots of props

662
00:24:19,649 --> 00:24:24,239
they can throw bowls and benches and

663
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:26,159
tables and if it's multi-level someone

664
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,830
always falls off the top level into the

665
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:34,019
bottom level through a table so it's

666
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:35,759
very conducive to fight scenes so if

667
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:39,179
you're on the internet you there is

668
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:41,700
probably a 100% chance that you will be

669
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:45,659
hacked this means you're always engaged

670
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:47,610
with attackers and you need to then look

671
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:49,289
inside of your network and say okay I

672
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:51,029
understand I have all these defenses in

673
00:24:49,289 --> 00:24:52,740
place I've done some user awareness

674
00:24:51,029 --> 00:24:55,200
training I've done all of these things

675
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:57,119
but you're still probably hacked in some

676
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,529
way shape form or fashion that's when

677
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:00,449
you need to turn to some of the newer

678
00:24:58,529 --> 00:25:03,529
techniques that we're talking about with

679
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:05,490
threat hunting where you're looking for

680
00:25:03,529 --> 00:25:07,139
machines that are already compromised in

681
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:08,940
your environment and you're not looking

682
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:11,248
for how it was hacked you're looking for

683
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:14,759
the data that was being passed once the

684
00:25:11,249 --> 00:25:16,049
system was hacked and in my other

685
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:17,340
presentation at two o'clock

686
00:25:16,049 --> 00:25:19,529
you all don't show up for that or the

687
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:24,408
great things I'll talk a lot more about

688
00:25:19,529 --> 00:25:27,389
the math behind how we're detecting so

689
00:25:24,409 --> 00:25:29,399
detecting backdoors and callbacks inside

690
00:25:27,389 --> 00:25:32,519
of a network and we have an open-source

691
00:25:29,399 --> 00:25:34,199
product for that which is this one Rita

692
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:36,330
right here so you'll see more and

693
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:39,059
screenshots of Rita in my presentation

694
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:41,840
at two however bro IDs is typically also

695
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:45,440
used for this type of threat hunting and

696
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:48,299
there are two awesome resources here

697
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,309
this one comes from squirrel I think put

698
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:52,950
this together it's like every blog post

699
00:25:50,309 --> 00:25:55,289
in research article on threat hunting

700
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:56,490
catalogued in one place completely free

701
00:25:55,289 --> 00:25:57,990
you can just go start reading and

702
00:25:56,490 --> 00:26:00,000
learning about it there's also one for

703
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:01,289
threat intelligence which is awesome

704
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,090
because they have ties to each other

705
00:26:01,289 --> 00:26:04,110
it's one of the correlation points for

706
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:05,939
when you're doing

707
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:08,519
is this IP address bad or is this

708
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:09,779
associated with some bad behavior so

709
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:16,529
those are some open source threat

710
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:19,470
hunting websites for you okay in the if

711
00:26:16,529 --> 00:26:20,039
you rush your training you will get your

712
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:23,700
ass kicked

713
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:25,769
100% of the time and there's this great

714
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:27,960
movie clan of the White Lotus some of

715
00:26:25,769 --> 00:26:31,559
you may recognize the the priest there

716
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:34,620
PI may right actually if you watched

717
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:37,289
Kill Bill Vol 2 that's Gordon Lee you he

718
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:40,018
actually plays PI May in Kill Bill Vol 2

719
00:26:37,289 --> 00:26:42,330
but in clan of the White Lotus in 1980

720
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:45,480
he played the person fighting him which

721
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:47,100
I thought was pretty awesome in Quentin

722
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:49,350
Tarantino actually dressed for the part

723
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,879
of Pi May and he was told he looked

724
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:53,939
absolutely ridiculous

725
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,649
so the him paid Gordon you do I'm full

726
00:26:53,940 --> 00:27:00,929
of useless knowledge like that by the

727
00:26:55,649 --> 00:27:02,870
way so a lot in this ties back to a

728
00:27:00,929 --> 00:27:05,279
point that I touched on before

729
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:07,768
insecurity you know I think a lot of us

730
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:09,179
had started before there was really an

731
00:27:07,769 --> 00:27:12,389
official security role in the

732
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:14,789
organization like you were in a in some

733
00:27:12,389 --> 00:27:17,639
other form of IP right when I started it

734
00:27:14,789 --> 00:27:19,080
at Brown University I worked in the

735
00:27:17,639 --> 00:27:22,769
systems administration's group there was

736
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:24,418
no security team like 15 years ago

737
00:27:22,769 --> 00:27:26,970
obviously things have changed since then

738
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:29,940
however the benefit that we had back

739
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:33,120
then was a lot of us worked like not in

740
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:34,889
security for a while before we started

741
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,360
doing security so we worked on the help

742
00:27:34,889 --> 00:27:38,820
desk we work on the network operations

743
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:40,139
team we worked in the sysadmin team we

744
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:42,389
got a taste for it it was like to

745
00:27:40,139 --> 00:27:44,189
actually build systems and make them

746
00:27:42,389 --> 00:27:46,649
work before we started breaking into

747
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:48,690
them and this is what I mean by rushing

748
00:27:46,649 --> 00:27:50,309
your training don't just go and start

749
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:52,769
taking Metasploit classes without

750
00:27:50,309 --> 00:27:55,649
understanding how stuff works set up in

751
00:27:52,769 --> 00:27:57,659
your own labs stuff that make stuff work

752
00:27:55,649 --> 00:28:00,600
right when I went for my job interview

753
00:27:57,659 --> 00:28:04,559
at Brown University they they asked me

754
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:06,629
like if I had experience with NFS inland

755
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:08,370
UNIX and I'll take a guy that's over at

756
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:10,440
my house they're like what do you mean

757
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:12,418
oh my god I brought a picture of my you

758
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:14,760
know server rack at home that I use for

759
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:16,440
my lab and they're like you have more

760
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,520
than some of our data centers in your

761
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,560
house

762
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,510
like yeah that's where I setup NFS they

763
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:24,990
were like wow like I cut the grass at

764
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:26,340
home and stuff oh they're like and they

765
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:29,760
hired me I don't know if they'd work for

766
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:32,100
everyone but figure out how to get stuff

767
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,580
working right set and I can tell you

768
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:37,260
right now the research Avenue lately if

769
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:39,990
you want to get into penetration testing

770
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:41,850
in any capacity you have to learn Active

771
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:43,710
Directory I mean you have the new Africa

772
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:45,149
rectally like really well it's one

773
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:47,160
reason like I don't do a lot of pen

774
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:48,870
testing anymore because I don't have the

775
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,430
patience or the time to go learn Active

776
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:52,320
Directory learn enough to be dangerous

777
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:53,610
but you have to know that stuff inside

778
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,230
out and backwards you should have that

779
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:57,840
setup in your home you should be

780
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:59,490
learning it figuring out how it works so

781
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:04,050
that when it comes time to break it you

782
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:06,090
have a foundation so when you do build

783
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:07,830
your lab at home right have a plan what

784
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:09,419
are your goals what areas do you want to

785
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:12,210
focus on what are your goals in your

786
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:15,720
career build the lab sign up for free

787
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:18,750
and low-cost training ok cyber re has

788
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:21,270
free training that's available IT Pro TV

789
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:23,130
we have a 50% discount code that we're

790
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:25,800
running on our show for IT pros evey

791
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:27,630
they're both awesome websites we're

792
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,580
partners in some capacity with both IP

793
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:32,670
protein is actually a full sponsor of

794
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:34,110
our net were entire network and a lot of

795
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:36,750
people have done projects with them

796
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:38,250
cyber re is also a partner as well we're

797
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:41,550
starting to indicate some of our content

798
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:44,310
on cyber re but for you the benefit is

799
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:46,230
it's like either free or really low cost

800
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:48,720
training that you can gain access to

801
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:50,880
libraries and libraries of training on

802
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,560
the internet which is awesome practice

803
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,550
every day and make sure you get a mentor

804
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:56,210
we cover that ok

805
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:59,250
so in those

806
00:29:56,210 --> 00:30:02,250
there is always someone more skilled

807
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:03,990
than you and in this movie

808
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:06,390
Wing Chun actually there's another

809
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:09,630
famous martial artist who happens to be

810
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:12,720
a woman and in the movie Michelle Yeoh

811
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:14,310
is dressed up as a man I mean she look

812
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,990
like I mean she's supposed to look like

813
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:17,730
a man but like you can you know the

814
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:20,430
actress so you're like that's ridiculous

815
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:23,160
and the movie Scott is extremely

816
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:26,760
ridiculous and it's funny but she's

817
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:30,080
dressed as a man and I people don't

818
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:32,790
think that she has the skills but

819
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:36,570
spoiler alert she kicks everyone's ass

820
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:38,310
and it's awesome right so you know while

821
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:40,800
you may not think someone has skills

822
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:43,620
they might and someone out there

823
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:45,540
probably has more Skills than you and

824
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:48,060
attackers might be more skilled than you

825
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:50,280
as well you need to learn from that now

826
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:51,990
a lot of tackers don't get me wrong I've

827
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:53,250
seen a lot of attackers be really really

828
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:55,320
dumb and that's usually what we see

829
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:57,210
right the ones that are really smart we

830
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,260
may not see but when we do we have to

831
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:01,290
appreciate that they might be more

832
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:03,900
skilled than us and others in the

833
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:06,720
security community may be less skilled

834
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:09,780
than you in the other light don't poke

835
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:14,790
fun at them I mean basically when I've

836
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:18,240
spoken with people like HD Moore and the

837
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:20,280
kids met Mike Kershaw and fielder of

838
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,730
nmap right they've run these really

839
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:26,490
large open-source projects and people

840
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:28,290
ask them questions all the time and all

841
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:30,480
three of them pretty much have the same

842
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:32,399
advice because I was like how do you you

843
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,350
deal with that and how do you prevent a

844
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:36,060
toxic environment from being created on

845
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:37,500
your mailing list and chat and all that

846
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:39,419
stuff where people are asking dumb

847
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:41,940
questions and they're like basically

848
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:44,010
don't be a dick what's what they told me

849
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:46,410
they're like be nice to people and that

850
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:48,240
message really stuck through with me as

851
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:49,680
I went through my career and InfoSec and

852
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,690
it's something that I've tried to coach

853
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:53,970
people on as well don't dismiss people

854
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:56,430
if they have a really stupid question

855
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:58,380
now I Dave Kennedy post some of the

856
00:31:56,430 --> 00:32:00,870
feedback he gets on his website I think

857
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:03,540
to Facebook and clearly there are some

858
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:05,909
really dumb people that are like hey can

859
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:08,520
you hack it into someone's email account

860
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:09,600
for me it's like no no that's not what

861
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:12,030
I'm talking about here

862
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,469
some people actually asking legitimate

863
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:19,049
questions okay

864
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:22,260
in the the weapon you choose matters

865
00:32:19,049 --> 00:32:24,418
little it takes skill to win that is

866
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:28,530
unless you're loud Carly young he was

867
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:30,960
teaching kung fu at five years old it's

868
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:32,309
amazing he's one of the most amazing

869
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:36,059
martial artists

870
00:32:32,309 --> 00:32:38,070
he holds the lineage for hung gar kung

871
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:41,039
fu or he did until he passed away and

872
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:43,770
passed that on to others as well and

873
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:46,049
this style of Kung Fu comes from Wong

874
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:48,270
fei-hung very famous Chinese hero he has

875
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:50,490
his own theme song okay like that's

876
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:51,900
awesome like I want my own personal

877
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:53,419
theme so I'm gonna be awesome

878
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:56,760
Longfellow had his own theme song

879
00:32:53,419 --> 00:32:59,820
because he was so influential in in

880
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:01,350
Chinese martial arts history and law

881
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:04,139
crazy on can pretty much pick up any

882
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:06,000
weapon there's a movie legendary weapons

883
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:08,400
of China where in the end he picks up

884
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,590
every kung-fu weapon that I knew to

885
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:12,840
exist and even ones that I didn't and

886
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:16,549
uses them to like beat someone asked

887
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:19,939
awesome definitely highly recommend film

888
00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:23,520
so just because you have a sword though

889
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:25,919
it doesn't mean you're dangerous right I

890
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:27,600
mean not all of us started teaching kung

891
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,850
fu when we're five right that's an

892
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:32,070
anomaly we can't just pick up a sword

893
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:36,120
and be effective with it right we need

894
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:40,350
training and so my advice on this level

895
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:42,870
is also from in awesome film 36 chambers

896
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:46,049
Shaolin with Gordon Liu he figures out

897
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:47,668
that he can't beat his teacher to get to

898
00:33:46,049 --> 00:33:49,260
the next level he has to be the teacher

899
00:33:47,669 --> 00:33:51,690
get to the next level and he just keeps

900
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:53,309
losing and losing and then he's like in

901
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:55,320
the woods and he's all mad and he

902
00:33:53,309 --> 00:33:57,928
smashes the staff against the tree and

903
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:59,820
it breaks and like makes his section so

904
00:33:57,929 --> 00:34:01,620
then he smashes the other side and he

905
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:04,230
makes like three sections and then

906
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:06,449
spoiler alert he takes his teacher's ass

907
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:08,010
which is awesome it's all he creates the

908
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:09,840
three section staff if you've ever tried

909
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:10,919
to wield one it's awesome I should

910
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,899
probably bring one to the talk for

911
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:14,549
demonstration it's awesome you hit

912
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:16,230
yourself in the head in the shin at the

913
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:20,070
same time it's amazing

914
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:21,810
uh-huh so but in so he built his own

915
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:22,890
tools right now there may have been

916
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:25,650
other similar to

917
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:27,239
out there that's okay me personally I

918
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:30,270
decided I want to write a port scanner

919
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:31,919
and see just because right I decided I

920
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:33,690
want a honey port script in Python oh

921
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:36,120
there's lots of honey port type scripts

922
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:38,310
out there but I wanted the experience so

923
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:40,679
when you go build something yourself a

924
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:42,770
tool if there's other things that exist

925
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:45,569
that's okay build it for your own

926
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:47,130
experience the same thing we do a show

927
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:48,870
start up security weekly you want to

928
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:50,880
start your own company don't worry about

929
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:53,520
being the only one in the space that's

930
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:56,580
like a freakish anomaly like uber is

931
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:58,590
like you in anomaly that's like one in a

932
00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:00,779
billion or a hundred million of

933
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:02,790
companies that are going to be the next

934
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:04,590
uber right don't worry about going into

935
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:06,450
a crowded space focus on what you do

936
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:07,920
best and follow your passion that's

937
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:09,270
going to be a much better path for you

938
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,130
than worrying about how unique you are

939
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:16,560
when you write a tool or or create a

940
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:18,960
company also along these lines tools

941
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:21,480
don't necessarily help us get the job

942
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,190
done I mean unless like your truck

943
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:26,580
Norris that's different right that's the

944
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:29,130
other anomaly but in this quote from

945
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:30,420
this awesome article Gary Kasparov was

946
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:30,810
once the greatest chess player in the

947
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:34,440
world

948
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:37,470
he played the IBM computer he lost teams

949
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:39,060
after that played the computer now they

950
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:40,560
weren't the best chess players in the

951
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:41,820
world right there were good chess

952
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,670
players but they weren't the best in the

953
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:46,440
world they also had a computer in

954
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:49,470
software to help them with that they

955
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:51,570
also had a really good process and we

956
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:52,950
read this article more like oh wow so

957
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:55,800
like when we look for vendor solutions

958
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:57,569
like you can't just buy software and

959
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,940
have it solve your problems you need

960
00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:01,740
smart people you need a good process and

961
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:03,450
you need some tools and you need all

962
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:05,220
three of those things to be successful

963
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:12,899
in a lot of the things we do offense or

964
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:15,660
defense ok in the best defense is always

965
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:17,940
to have a good offense one of my in it

966
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:19,410
this is a terrible movie actually the

967
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:22,170
one with Jet Li has anyone seen the one

968
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:23,460
with gently anyone couple people you

969
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:25,350
wish you could get your time back feels

970
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:28,260
pretty bad but one of the awesome things

971
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:29,819
in this movie was there's two versions

972
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:32,850
of Jet Li there's the good Jet Li the

973
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:35,100
bad Jet Li and they come from alternate

974
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:39,270
universes I told you it was a bad movie

975
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:41,880
and so but the style of kung fu that

976
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:45,030
they use in the movie fits their

977
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:48,180
character perfectly the good Jet Li uses

978
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:51,870
bagua right very soft circular motions

979
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:54,569
right the bad Jet Li uses Jing Yi very

980
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:56,609
hard fast movements both internal styles

981
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:58,650
by the way but you know it said ba gua

982
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:59,820
will go around the walls uni will just

983
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:02,640
burn straight through the wall so it was

984
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:05,310
really cool to see those styles in use

985
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:07,529
now in Jing Yi every block is also a

986
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:10,470
strike it's all about being on offense

987
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:15,270
at all times in this particular style of

988
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:16,649
comfortable ok I liken that to a lot of

989
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:19,490
things we're talking about with web

990
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:21,720
applications and the web application

991
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:24,120
landscape right now is very very

992
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:26,520
interesting and I think to be really

993
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:28,710
successful we have to be on the offense

994
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:31,200
the entire time to defend our web

995
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:33,750
applications and we started out with

996
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:35,609
this thing called whack right turns out

997
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:37,410
processing all those requests and having

998
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:39,210
very little understanding of your web

999
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:41,640
application and trying to block things

1000
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:45,030
not such a good idea now if you use a

1001
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:46,799
web successfully we should talk it might

1002
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:48,810
be a short conversation I hope I could

1003
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,640
persuade you to some newer technologies

1004
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:56,340
that are out there so then we said let's

1005
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:57,540
develop rasp right and rasped is a small

1006
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:59,250
program that sits inside the web

1007
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:01,020
application server the application

1008
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:03,600
server and monitors all of those

1009
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:05,280
requests so it has knowledge it can look

1010
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:07,380
at a function call and to say that

1011
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,790
function call normally does this but now

1012
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:09,780
it's doing this other thing it doesn't

1013
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:11,370
have to worry about hundreds of

1014
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:13,350
thousands of requests from the front end

1015
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:15,120
it's just looking at the back end with

1016
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:17,100
knowledge and intelligence right and

1017
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:19,380
there's some vendors in that space then

1018
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:21,210
there's the cloud dmz vendors they take

1019
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:23,430
your entire application they put it up

1020
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:25,980
in the cloud they do all the protection

1021
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:27,058
and you just manage it remotely so

1022
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:29,490
that's kind of interesting you give up

1023
00:38:27,059 --> 00:38:31,349
some control however they're able to put

1024
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:33,390
it up in that DMZ they have technology

1025
00:38:31,349 --> 00:38:35,220
that can kind of throw away basically

1026
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:36,420
everything that's coming at them and

1027
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:38,339
they're just looking at what's going on

1028
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:40,170
inside of your application it's kind of

1029
00:38:38,339 --> 00:38:42,690
like a hosted rasa think of it now

1030
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:46,109
there's some some new ones that are like

1031
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:47,940
a I call it like a whap rasp cloud DMZ I

1032
00:38:46,109 --> 00:38:50,640
think they're creating a new market

1033
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:52,079
right it's a bold move you're creating a

1034
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,819
new company you're trying to create a

1035
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,890
new market right because everyone likes

1036
00:38:53,819 --> 00:38:57,450
we know what a whap is right some people

1037
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:58,680
are starting to learn what rasp is like

1038
00:38:57,450 --> 00:39:00,750
that's a market as well

1039
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:02,730
signal science is an imino they're

1040
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:04,349
creating an entirely new market what

1041
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:06,329
they're doing is they can put an agent

1042
00:39:04,349 --> 00:39:08,339
on your system they can hook into your

1043
00:39:06,329 --> 00:39:10,680
web server not your application server

1044
00:39:08,339 --> 00:39:12,180
but like an Apache module or they can

1045
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:14,669
hook directly in your application server

1046
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:17,730
they collect data they put it up in the

1047
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:19,410
cloud they do machine actual well signal

1048
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:20,789
Sciences does actual machine learning

1049
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:22,470
there's actually the folks that came

1050
00:39:20,789 --> 00:39:24,420
from Etsy and developed their security

1051
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:26,640
program for their web applications they

1052
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:28,559
founded the company full disclosure they

1053
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,808
are a sponsor but I like their

1054
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:32,549
technology because it lets you look at

1055
00:39:30,809 --> 00:39:34,980
all the performance things and all the

1056
00:39:32,549 --> 00:39:37,259
security things in in one screen and

1057
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:39,750
it's doing that differently from all the

1058
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:41,460
other web application technologies so

1059
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:45,119
that's kind of a brief overview of the

1060
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:50,910
web application landscape okay how we

1061
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:56,460
doing on time okay thank you uh number

1062
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:59,279
ten the softer styles of kungfu always

1063
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:02,819
lead to victory has anyone seen the Tai

1064
00:39:59,279 --> 00:40:05,549
Chi master for Jetley anyone a couple

1065
00:40:02,819 --> 00:40:07,859
couple people awesome movie right my

1066
00:40:05,549 --> 00:40:10,500
favorite part of the movie is when Jet

1067
00:40:07,859 --> 00:40:12,660
Li literally goes insane like he loses

1068
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:14,369
his mind in the movie and those who

1069
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,569
think jelly isn't a good actor you have

1070
00:40:14,369 --> 00:40:17,279
to watch that movie because he does a

1071
00:40:15,569 --> 00:40:19,829
really good job and it's really funny

1072
00:40:17,279 --> 00:40:21,569
because he goes crazy and then like

1073
00:40:19,829 --> 00:40:24,059
magically he comes to his senses and

1074
00:40:21,569 --> 00:40:26,099
realized because his best friend turned

1075
00:40:24,059 --> 00:40:27,869
on him and is now in cahoots with the

1076
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:29,970
government and killed his friends and

1077
00:40:27,869 --> 00:40:32,279
all stuff happened and then gently

1078
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:36,000
realizes that the only way to beat his

1079
00:40:32,279 --> 00:40:37,500
friend is to learn Tai Chi and integrate

1080
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,500
the hardware styles of

1081
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:46,080
with the softer style of Kung Fu and he

1082
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:48,030
goes on to victory so I started to think

1083
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:50,690
about some of the softer styles and

1084
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:54,210
actually integrate this in a different

1085
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:57,150
lens in my other talk as well the soft

1086
00:40:54,210 --> 00:41:00,120
softer styles in security almost lead to

1087
00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:02,670
almost always lead to victory more so

1088
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:06,270
than the harder styles right so I did it

1089
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:08,310
this little pie chart right and these

1090
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:11,670
are how vulnerabilities are really fixed

1091
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:13,049
in an organization and this red area

1092
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:15,180
right here that's your vulnerability

1093
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:18,300
management program like on its own

1094
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:19,770
without working together and this is

1095
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,750
like the yellow this is your patch

1096
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:23,910
management program like working in a

1097
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:25,770
silo and and not working together and

1098
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:27,540
it's like little green sites right here

1099
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:29,009
that's like Bob the IT guy just going

1100
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:32,220
around and like fixing stuff on his own

1101
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:35,220
and patch things and this blue area is

1102
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:37,439
actually working together as a team the

1103
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:39,930
most successful vulnerability management

1104
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,940
programs do you know which product they

1105
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:46,649
use from which vendor anyone I used to

1106
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:48,780
work for a vendor anyone anyone it

1107
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:51,210
doesn't matter they use whatever they

1108
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:53,520
want the most successful one develop

1109
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:54,930
software themselves to integrate the

1110
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,850
work flow between vulnerability

1111
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:59,580
management and patch management and

1112
00:41:56,850 --> 00:42:00,720
remediation almost always homework I

1113
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:02,580
mean they will actually come to me and

1114
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,629
say we kind of I don't know if we want

1115
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:05,640
to maintain this anymore it's really

1116
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:08,100
expensive like what can we buy and like

1117
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:10,350
nothing you're doing awesome like you go

1118
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:12,810
you can go go get a drink like you're

1119
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:15,330
fine that has those have been the most

1120
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:16,230
successful programs that I've seen and

1121
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:17,640
I've talked to a lot of people about

1122
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:20,040
their vulnerability management programs

1123
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:21,870
so working together as a team is an

1124
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:24,720
integral part and it's one of those

1125
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:25,890
software styles right that we have to

1126
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,810
learn as information security

1127
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:30,540
professionals we're often put in that

1128
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:32,850
situation where we have to get someone

1129
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:35,190
to do something that might not be in

1130
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:38,490
their job description so we definitely

1131
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:40,050
need those software styles Incident

1132
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:42,569
Response is a great example of that

1133
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:44,520
right we have to get our entire team on

1134
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:46,950
board today hey you know what with we're

1135
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,270
hacks really bad hey you Bob do you have

1136
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:50,189
to stop what you're doing whatever

1137
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:51,240
project you're on and you're going to do

1138
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:53,400
stuff for security

1139
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:56,580
and bobs like put security Paul's

1140
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:58,320
problem no no no no no no no security is

1141
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:59,819
everyone's problem okay we all need to

1142
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:01,980
work together and that's part of the

1143
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:03,630
software styles then I'm talking about

1144
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:05,250
so we have done some of that right I am

1145
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:06,900
the Calvary we had Katie moszer's and

1146
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:09,480
Josh Corman on our show to talk about

1147
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:11,609
healthcare security it based off of a

1148
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:13,560
tweet that I put out there because I'm

1149
00:43:11,609 --> 00:43:15,569
like well first of all you just can't go

1150
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:17,040
poking fun and all the heinous moment

1151
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:18,780
well you can but all the hands

1152
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:21,029
vulnerabilities and IOT devices that are

1153
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:23,310
using healthcare right so my tweet

1154
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:26,460
somehow garnered a lot of attention my

1155
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:28,950
son was born in June last year and when

1156
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:30,510
my wife was in labor I had my phone out

1157
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:33,330
and she was like you're not tweeting are

1158
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:35,820
you like no no I'm not tweeting fire and

1159
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:37,799
labor we said no social media while

1160
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:39,240
you're in labor right and since she's

1161
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:41,580
like oh look at the baby's heartbeat on

1162
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:46,589
the screen and I'm like is that Windows

1163
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:48,810
98 she wasn't too happy with it at that

1164
00:43:46,589 --> 00:43:51,930
point and then she was like you're not

1165
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:54,390
tweeting that are you like no no and so

1166
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:56,848
I tweeted it and it was the most

1167
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:57,839
retweeted shared and likes tweet that I

1168
00:43:56,849 --> 00:44:00,480
ever made

1169
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:02,910
Katy Missouri said it got more retweets

1170
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:05,700
than when she launched some very famous

1171
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:07,859
programs at Microsoft so I was like wow

1172
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:09,180
this is really a problem that we need to

1173
00:44:07,859 --> 00:44:11,609
address until we have them on a show to

1174
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:13,109
talk about well yeah we can point at

1175
00:44:11,609 --> 00:44:14,490
things and go that's windows 98 and

1176
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:16,020
that's bad but what do we really do to

1177
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:17,609
fix the problem it turns out like

1178
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:19,740
talking to people and trying to affect

1179
00:44:17,609 --> 00:44:21,089
change is a lot harder than just

1180
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,339
pointing at something and saying it's

1181
00:44:21,089 --> 00:44:24,960
Windows 98

1182
00:44:22,339 --> 00:44:26,460
she did my wife did lift the social

1183
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,830
media ban I'm like we're trending on

1184
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:30,780
Twitter this is awesome she's like

1185
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:36,690
really while I'm in labor she's like

1186
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:38,780
wait how many retweets did you get you

1187
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:41,160
also don't need expensive tools to win

1188
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:42,510
one of the things when you first started

1189
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:44,190
martial arts training is you learn to

1190
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:46,109
use the staff because once you learn to

1191
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:48,089
use the staff conceivably you can pick

1192
00:44:46,109 --> 00:44:49,200
up any other weapon and be effective

1193
00:44:48,089 --> 00:44:51,089
with it because the fundamental

1194
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:53,609
principles are the same just like you

1195
00:44:51,089 --> 00:44:56,700
can pick up a chair or bench right like

1196
00:44:53,609 --> 00:44:59,520
they had in China and be very effective

1197
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:01,740
with it and that's really cool it turns

1198
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:03,450
out that you really don't need expensive

1199
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:05,069
tools to win a computer security either

1200
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:07,919
and there

1201
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:09,360
are some examples here and it's actually

1202
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,190
this was actually the foundation for the

1203
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:12,720
talk I'm giving it two o'clock my

1204
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:15,300
original thought was I'm going to talk

1205
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:18,390
about enterprise security tools that are

1206
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:19,830
free right and I don't for whatever

1207
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:21,509
reason I decided to go in different

1208
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:22,170
directions but that's kind of how it all

1209
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:25,520
started

1210
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:28,710
and as I talk to a lot of organizations

1211
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:30,810
whether it's a casual conversation at a

1212
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:32,670
conference or in the bar afterwards or

1213
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:35,460
if it's a more formal thing and some

1214
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:37,290
consulting I do for ions I notice the

1215
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:39,510
theme emerging that a lot of enterprises

1216
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:41,670
are using open-source software a lot of

1217
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:44,550
enterprises are using bro a lot of

1218
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:46,230
enterprises are using Microsoft advanced

1219
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:48,930
threat analytics which is not a it's

1220
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:51,690
either included or free right pfSense

1221
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:53,490
firewalls so there's a lot of stuff out

1222
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:58,410
there that's completely free so you

1223
00:45:53,490 --> 00:46:00,060
don't need the tools to win okay

1224
00:45:58,410 --> 00:46:05,520
so this is some political and social

1225
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:07,400
things number eleven the bad guys are

1226
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:09,810
always in cahoots with the government

1227
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:13,170
take from that what you will draw your

1228
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:15,690
own conclusions about politics today but

1229
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:18,480
almost always as an iron monkey right

1230
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:22,440
the the enemy in this case is the

1231
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:24,390
government and the hero in this movie is

1232
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:25,590
a Robin hood-like character that steals

1233
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:28,140
from the rich and gives to the poor is

1234
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:30,180
basically the plot of iron monkey but

1235
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:33,240
the bad guys are definitely government

1236
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:35,129
and the people like even the Shaolin

1237
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:38,790
monks in this movie are in cahoots with

1238
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:40,020
the government so this is where we

1239
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:42,509
talking about state-sponsored hacking

1240
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:44,009
and being includes the government you

1241
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:45,510
know this is obviously Dave

1242
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:47,400
consciousness in this keynote this is

1243
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:48,540
obviously an entire talk in and of

1244
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:50,790
itself

1245
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:52,259
however if you're knocking if you're

1246
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:53,279
tired of watching kung fu movies because

1247
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:55,110
you're gonna go watch a lot of times for

1248
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:57,960
movies after this talk you should also

1249
00:46:55,110 --> 00:47:00,060
watch the documentary film zero days

1250
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:01,230
little little coordinates in there I

1251
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:03,930
don't want to spoil it for you I won't

1252
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:05,880
spoil this one for you but really delves

1253
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:07,529
into this topic and kind of get you

1254
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:09,930
thinking about how the bad guys are in

1255
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:15,320
cahoots with a lot of governments not

1256
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:15,319
just one okay number twelve

1257
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:22,910
the protagonist always wants to learn

1258
00:47:18,890 --> 00:47:25,520
kungfu to take revenge i would say 80 to

1259
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:29,330
90% of the kung-fu movies out there our

1260
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:31,940
revenge based plot right the best

1261
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:34,279
revenge based spot is eight diagram pole

1262
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:37,880
player again with coordinate law Charlie

1263
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:40,030
young also in that movie as well this

1264
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:43,580
movie was awesome just as a side note

1265
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:45,470
there was a famous actor in chinese

1266
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:47,900
kungfu cinema that actually died in a

1267
00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:49,899
car promoter cycle or car crash during

1268
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:52,910
the filming of this movie and that

1269
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:55,610
feeling of the actors and actresses in

1270
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:57,080
this film really comes through like you

1271
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:59,030
can just see the expression on his face

1272
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:01,690
in this final fight seem like they're

1273
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:05,120
just visibly upset and it really adds

1274
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:05,660
dimension to the film that is just

1275
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:07,490
awesome

1276
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:09,259
I mean it's like some of the greatest

1277
00:48:07,490 --> 00:48:11,750
scenes in kung fu is like he walks up

1278
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:14,990
with this gigantic car of staffs and

1279
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:16,400
then like drops it and then like pushes

1280
00:48:14,990 --> 00:48:17,839
a whole bunch of the staffs and they're

1281
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,880
like stabbing people it's just

1282
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:22,610
spectacular it's awesome it's a really

1283
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:25,640
cool movie but very much revenge themes

1284
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:29,090
revenge hacking is not really a good

1285
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:32,060
idea though in computer security not

1286
00:48:29,090 --> 00:48:34,250
where you want to go hacking into other

1287
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:36,320
people's systems even if you're the good

1288
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:38,660
guy trying to get back at the bad guy

1289
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:40,310
the FBI's gotten into a lot of trouble

1290
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:41,899
lately they've been a lot of public

1291
00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:44,029
scrutiny for some of the things they did

1292
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:46,010
a specialist operation playset and new

1293
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:46,760
information is coming out about that all

1294
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:49,670
the time

1295
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:53,540
word is the latest on on this story is

1296
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:56,330
they've got an exploit for tor they can

1297
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:59,050
uncover users they won't bring it up in

1298
00:48:56,330 --> 00:49:03,400
court because then it would be public so

1299
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:03,400
okay number 13

1300
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:08,340
the most popular kung-fu movies aren't

1301
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:10,350
always the best ones and this one really

1302
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:12,150
pains me because everyone talks about

1303
00:49:10,350 --> 00:49:14,250
five fingers of death right it was a

1304
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:16,260
movie in the 1970s that started the come

1305
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:17,790
cool craze it was in screens all across

1306
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:18,990
the US and people like this is the

1307
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:22,290
greatest comfort movie ever

1308
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:24,029
yes yeah I mean it's when his palm glows

1309
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:25,590
red like that's really cool I think

1310
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:27,210
that's awesome

1311
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:29,790
the original title of that film is

1312
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:33,240
actually a king boxer for those who want

1313
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:34,980
more useless kung fu movie trivia but so

1314
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:36,990
the most popular vendors aren't

1315
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:38,940
necessarily the best and we have a lot

1316
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:41,040
of choices out there today we have an

1317
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:42,360
entire show we're looking at new vendors

1318
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:44,100
new products new product features and

1319
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:46,620
integrations called enterprise security

1320
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:48,480
weekly and I have to say a lot of the

1321
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:50,160
larger players either bite off more than

1322
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:53,760
they can chew or they don't keep up with

1323
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:55,230
their technology Trend Micro just had an

1324
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,180
announcement they're like we use machine

1325
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:58,380
learning like said nothing else on how

1326
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:59,879
they're using machine learning in their

1327
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:01,230
antivirus product I'm like really like

1328
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:03,240
is you just saying that because like all

1329
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:04,620
the other cool kids are saying machine

1330
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:06,540
learning like oh we can say machine

1331
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:08,670
learning too yeah we got that we're cool

1332
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:10,350
too like no just because you're the

1333
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:13,140
popular doesn't mean that you're the

1334
00:50:10,350 --> 00:50:14,580
best there are some like silence a bit

1335
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:17,160
up a little more they can chew wanted to

1336
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:19,049
be the next big antivirus player not so

1337
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:21,089
much working out for them although they

1338
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:22,680
put a lot of money in marketing so they

1339
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:24,210
would seem like a big player that

1340
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:25,830
doesn't necessarily they're mean they're

1341
00:50:24,210 --> 00:50:28,560
the best now silence may work for some

1342
00:50:25,830 --> 00:50:32,130
people and that's fine I'm not disputing

1343
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:33,299
that so and big players in Sim - I mean

1344
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:36,150
they're losing to some of the smaller

1345
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:38,760
players puva companies are coming in

1346
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:41,700
saying hey spend like 20 grand less with

1347
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:43,650
your sim and give that to us and we'll

1348
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:46,259
give you more functionality or maybe

1349
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:47,970
even save 20 grand after you pay 20

1350
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:49,920
grand for the product so there's a lot

1351
00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:53,040
of interesting things happening in the

1352
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:54,270
vendor space okay moving quickly because

1353
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:57,350
I probably only have about five minutes

1354
00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:59,340
left in the console movies

1355
00:50:57,350 --> 00:51:01,170
student use comes through to over go

1356
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:02,430
home personal challenges the crippled

1357
00:51:01,170 --> 00:51:05,160
Avengers is one of the most hilarious

1358
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:08,399
movies there's like undo this blind

1359
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:10,379
another one that has no legs another one

1360
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,850
that just goes crazy which is really

1361
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:14,670
funny to watch now I forget the other

1362
00:51:11,850 --> 00:51:16,868
but they use kung fu to overcome

1363
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:20,230
personal challenges

1364
00:51:16,869 --> 00:51:22,690
um and what's interesting is many use

1365
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:24,999
hacking tools that I've met in my career

1366
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:27,759
here in information security use hacking

1367
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:31,959
and hacking tools in the community to

1368
00:51:27,759 --> 00:51:33,910
overcome personal challenges you know we

1369
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:36,309
have our own awkward hugging website

1370
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:38,740
like how awesome is our community like

1371
00:51:36,309 --> 00:51:39,369
Jason is Jason he's not hidden come to

1372
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:41,618
my talk

1373
00:51:39,369 --> 00:51:44,109
jerk never mind forget what I saw I'm

1374
00:51:41,619 --> 00:51:46,480
just kidding so we have our own awkward

1375
00:51:44,109 --> 00:51:48,999
hugging website like how awesome is that

1376
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:50,680
the security theorem is really great and

1377
00:51:48,999 --> 00:51:52,240
there's always a new challenge that

1378
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:54,730
constantly evolves right it's always

1379
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:56,680
keeping your attention and helping you

1380
00:51:54,730 --> 00:51:58,630
maybe overcome those personal challenges

1381
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:01,930
by just having a really engaging and fun

1382
00:51:58,630 --> 00:52:03,460
job in computer security and I think it

1383
00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:04,720
builds your confidence too right we're

1384
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:06,609
all trying to do the right thing and

1385
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:08,859
protect people hopefully we all are

1386
00:52:06,609 --> 00:52:15,009
better not kick your ass all right

1387
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:17,589
number 15 the righteous path is fraught

1388
00:52:15,009 --> 00:52:20,170
with peril but always leads to a hero

1389
00:52:17,589 --> 00:52:22,359
so the protagonist in the film often has

1390
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:25,029
to endure several challenges Gordon Lee

1391
00:52:22,359 --> 00:52:27,609
you has to jump over this moat in this

1392
00:52:25,029 --> 00:52:29,349
movie in order to eat rice and if his

1393
00:52:27,609 --> 00:52:31,480
clothes get wet you can't eat the rice

1394
00:52:29,349 --> 00:52:33,640
it's a really interesting thing that he

1395
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:36,640
goes through so there's a lot of peril

1396
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:39,160
and then they come out of that like

1397
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,640
better people essentially so security is

1398
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:44,049
hard

1399
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:46,779
there's my token unicorn and what you

1400
00:52:44,049 --> 00:52:49,690
know what people say is that well I can

1401
00:52:46,779 --> 00:52:51,730
just do acts to prevent breeches or my

1402
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:53,079
network was easy to secure I just did

1403
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:55,690
this like you don't hear people saying

1404
00:52:53,079 --> 00:52:57,640
that I hope you don't security is hard

1405
00:52:55,690 --> 00:53:00,160
and there's a lot of challenges that we

1406
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:02,558
have to overcome in order to achieve a

1407
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:05,759
secure network so in that respect it is

1408
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:10,140
a parallel to some of the comfort movies

1409
00:53:05,759 --> 00:53:10,140
okay number 16

1410
00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:18,290
so sometimes the heroes don't start out

1411
00:53:13,910 --> 00:53:21,950
as such this is gently in film in this

1412
00:53:18,290 --> 00:53:23,750
film with gently he is kind of a well

1413
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:25,220
he's an asshole in the film he beats

1414
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:28,100
people up and he hurts them really bad

1415
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:29,779
and he kills someone and then jellies

1416
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:31,850
family gets killed and then he goes out

1417
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:33,020
into the woods and he learns Taichi and

1418
00:53:31,850 --> 00:53:34,368
he comes back and he kicks everyone's

1419
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:35,720
ass needs a hero okay

1420
00:53:34,369 --> 00:53:37,840
hope it's not too many spoilers in there

1421
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:41,118
you still watch the movie it's awesome

1422
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:43,640
so but he did not start out as a hero

1423
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:45,650
right at all there are a lot of people

1424
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:49,069
in our industry they did not necessarily

1425
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:51,140
start out as heroes but have turned over

1426
00:53:49,070 --> 00:53:53,330
a new leaf and are doing good things and

1427
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:55,279
hopefully you recognize everyone in here

1428
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:58,640
kevin Mitnick Samy Kamkar and Kevin

1429
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:59,750
Poulsen okay okay I think we're gonna

1430
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:04,490
end the climb how much time to have a

1431
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:08,270
like two minutes okay I'm done useless

1432
00:54:04,490 --> 00:54:10,129
comical movie facts and other stuff this

1433
00:54:08,270 --> 00:54:13,910
is my top 10 list of kung fu movies

1434
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:15,470
right here okay so take a picture of

1435
00:54:13,910 --> 00:54:16,819
that I'll try and post the slides for

1436
00:54:15,470 --> 00:54:18,500
you I'll let them take a picture that

1437
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:22,690
your homework is to go watch all those

1438
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:22,690
movies they're awesome they're great

1439
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:27,259
they're on my website now I should have

1440
00:54:25,609 --> 00:54:28,520
put the link on the left side maybe a

1441
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:30,740
tool clogged up with the link for this

1442
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:32,119
talk because I have to look it up okay

1443
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:35,569
so here's five more for good measure

1444
00:54:32,119 --> 00:54:37,550
like these are really good too and like

1445
00:54:35,570 --> 00:54:40,490
I just I couldn't like these are five

1446
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:43,850
more which like they are really awesome

1447
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:45,618
too and I'm not the best screen on

1448
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:47,868
screen martial artist that's actually me

1449
00:54:45,619 --> 00:54:50,390
and that that is a shovel re-enacting a

1450
00:54:47,869 --> 00:54:51,440
scene from a kung fu movie but these are

1451
00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:53,600
what I thought were the best on-screen

1452
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:55,130
martial artists definitely not good

1453
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:58,700
thing I have a job insecurity is all I

1454
00:54:55,130 --> 00:55:00,980
have to say ridiculous facts people say

1455
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:03,109
you must be tired of living like a lot

1456
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:07,450
which i think is a really great line and

1457
00:55:03,109 --> 00:55:07,450
other stuff and I think that's it
