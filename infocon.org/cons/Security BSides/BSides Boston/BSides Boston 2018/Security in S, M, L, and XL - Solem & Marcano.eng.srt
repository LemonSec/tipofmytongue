12
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,820
here

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,668
with Pedro and Vic giving us a great

14
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:35,219
talk about security in many sizes as one

15
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:38,599
size does not sell it fit all so let's

16
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:38,600
give a warm welcome to Pedro today

17
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:47,670
thanks Josh so as you noticed if you've

18
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,550
never been to B sides before every tone

19
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:54,590
is a little bit light my name is Pedro

20
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:56,510
this is Vic we're known as Pedro and Vic

21
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:59,760
nothing special about that

22
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:03,089
so the talk today it's funny because you

23
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:06,240
get on these on the mood of doing the

24
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:08,130
talk and you hear what you want to talk

25
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,979
about in other people's talk especially

26
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:13,350
this late in the day it's that there's a

27
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:16,830
lot of talk about how to do security for

28
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:19,949
$0 small businesses all the things that

29
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:22,560
they should do so we're going to talk

30
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,210
about how to do security for small

31
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,020
businesses medium businesses large

32
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:30,000
businesses but we're gonna put a twist

33
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:32,820
to that we're going to compare that to

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,530
kind of people in fashion alright so

35
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,179
some people have come up to me today and

36
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:40,409
say hey you got a shirt with ninjas on

37
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,909
well this is Deadpool and other people

38
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:42,479
for some reason can only see the yellow

39
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:45,390
spots

40
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:48,240
those are tacos and then in between we

41
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:51,180
have swords so my fashion sense is just

42
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,390
not the best but I'm ok I'm ok with that

43
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,909
I'm ok so I'm talking about fashion I

44
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,680
just want to talk about people that go

45
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:02,130
into stores right there is a

46
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:05,189
particularly large large stores there's

47
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:07,380
a lot of mirrors around so you see

48
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:09,959
people walking through and thirsty on

49
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,849
the wrists of mirrors they just walk

50
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,560
through thanks oh yeah

51
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:18,480
do I look fat in this

52
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:20,010
hey of course you do but you're as well

53
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,170
some people some people are very

54
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:24,209
realistic about what they look like and

55
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:27,480
then you know there is some of us that

56
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:31,350
just walk into the store just go this

57
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:35,250
shirt looks good on me it's like I'm all

58
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:38,609
pumped up right so what does that have

59
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:40,410
to do with security better oh Allah

60
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:42,300
there's a lot of people that are looking

61
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:44,970
at their security programs and they're

62
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:48,090
just you know they're very happy they

63
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:50,220
feel protected they feel nurtured for

64
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,230
some reason and they're happy with with

65
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,540
with the state of security and then you

66
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:57,690
have consultants come in and say your

67
00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:01,500
baby's ugly you got to throw it up there

68
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:03,600
is in usually the those are the ones

69
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:07,290
that are most comfortable with their

70
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,489
security programs right it's like we're

71
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:11,609
doing everything we have all the

72
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:14,040
products we have all the labels we got

73
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:15,930
the gardener's we got the other analysts

74
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,410
and the old come in and the blister

75
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:22,260
program

76
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:24,840
well you're less than covered right the

77
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:28,410
the emperor has no clothes and to stick

78
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,480
with their fashion sense today for those

79
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:33,209
of you that are here because they saw my

80
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,910
previous talk and some months ago and

81
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:36,989
you got salsa lessons for free big is

82
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:39,510
going to be doing most of their talking

83
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:41,549
and none of the dancing so sorry to

84
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,840
disappoint you you're gonna have to come

85
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:46,459
to another talk at some other point in

86
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:51,000
time but with that I'll leave you a big

87
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:53,250
thank you better so we're going to talk

88
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,090
about small medium large and extra-large

89
00:03:53,250 --> 00:04:00,750
the topic of the talk I'm Vic Solem the

90
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:04,140
MEI security we do physical and digital

91
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:05,730
security consulting so as part of every

92
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:08,000
talk I have to start by saying I'm not

93
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:10,500
kidding there's an emergency exit here

94
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,970
there's another money exit out the door

95
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,140
to the right and turn right there's a

96
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:16,228
fire line pull up there asmath our

97
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,969
extinguisher here because we're the

98
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:21,450
paranoid ones who really take this stuff

99
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:23,340
seriously it's how we live and work it's

100
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:24,719
not a lot of fun sometimes

101
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:29,849
but today we're going to talk about

102
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:33,480
sizing so forgive me I'm going to try

103
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:35,040
not to stretch the analogy a little in

104
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,050
some ways we're going to be talking

105
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,230
about acting as a security tailor

106
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:42,210
getting your program to fit just right

107
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:44,400
we are going to focus on small and

108
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:45,479
medium businesses later on but for right

109
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,489
now we're going to talk about small

110
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,860
medium large and extra-large we'll say

111
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:51,600
what that means in a little bit going to

112
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:56,070
cover a little bit about points of view

113
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,870
on security and that has to do with what

114
00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:01,380
you're wearing and what you're buying

115
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:05,639
and why and we're going to talk a little

116
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:08,130
bit about specifics on what a small

117
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:10,229
business can do we do cover zero dollar

118
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:12,030
budget because some of some folks are in

119
00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:13,349
that boat sometimes we talk to you just

120
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:15,330
don't have budget for security but they

121
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:17,940
know they need to do something and there

122
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:19,349
are things that you can do and if you

123
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:22,370
have budget you may be using some

124
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:25,250
freeware tools and that's really okay

125
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:28,229
the other thing I want to say is that

126
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:29,640
when we talk about security we want to

127
00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:32,760
be sure that we get the size right and

128
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:36,479
to pay those point when we're going

129
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:38,310
shopping I may want to be a large but

130
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,380
I'm an extra-large that's the way it is

131
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:42,360
I haven't beaten this back yet it's

132
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:44,190
still here I can't put on a large shirt

133
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,479
it's just not going to work right but

134
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:47,550
for security you've got to get the size

135
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:49,919
exactly right for instance I'm going

136
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:51,630
into a hazardous environment I'm gonna

137
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,099
want to look at the chart and I'm gonna

138
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:56,850
want to know that not only am I not an

139
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:59,039
extra-large I'm a double extra-large and

140
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:00,660
if I'm going to put on a hazmat suit I

141
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,490
better get the right thing that doesn't

142
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,650
matter how much I like something at the

143
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,700
store if I need it to fit right if it

144
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:08,280
absolutely has to fit right like

145
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:10,349
insecurity you've got to get the size

146
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,700
right and if you think your environment

147
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:13,350
is a certain size you better be sure

148
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,789
your environment is a certain size be

149
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:17,820
sure you know your environment we'll

150
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:19,020
talk about that a lot here and by our

151
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:25,620
environments come in all shapes and

152
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:28,750
sizes and people's companies and teddy

153
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:30,820
bears come in all sizes

154
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:35,080
I have the cool slides that Jack has I

155
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:38,650
wish I had talked before Jack you got to

156
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:45,930
deal with what you got well we'll move

157
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:48,880
forward so you talk a little lot sizing

158
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:50,650
when you're buying off the rack you're

159
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,060
getting whatever is happens to be there

160
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:55,210
and you may be customizing it on your

161
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:57,310
own right if you're super expensive on

162
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:58,900
the big end of the scale the vendors are

163
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:03,580
coming to you and customizing everything

164
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:06,760
you want so there's sort of the analogy

165
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:09,280
between I'm small and I can't afford to

166
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:12,730
tell or I say what they're going to do

167
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,650
or I'm big and I'm going to tell them

168
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:16,270
this is what you're going to deliver and

169
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:17,500
you've got to keep this in mind when you

170
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,969
think about what products you're looking

171
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,000
at and what companies are dealing with a

172
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:24,940
big company is less likely to be

173
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,350
customizable for you than a small one it

174
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:29,230
also depends a lot on your environment

175
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:31,060
right what are you wearing you're

176
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:32,850
wearing Vera Wang or Eddie Bauer you're

177
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:37,030
making your own clothes are you a

178
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:39,400
barracuda shop that's your way of doing

179
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:42,369
things are you a Cisco shop that's it

180
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:44,710
right that's how you work do you build

181
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:47,770
fires out of OpenBSD by hand the way God

182
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:50,919
intended all right I mean whatever

183
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:53,229
whatever your culture is you've got to

184
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:54,760
know that you have to fit your security

185
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:56,919
solutions to that and each of them has

186
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,719
merit but you got to be sure that you

187
00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:00,280
know what your environment is what size

188
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:05,020
you are so when you're going shopping

189
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:11,409
you know what you're looking for sorry

190
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:12,758
my screen didn't scroll correctly so

191
00:08:11,409 --> 00:08:15,129
presentation there a couple of images I

192

have some and I will tell you if you go

194
00:08:18,189 --> 00:08:22,509
looking on the web for images having to

195
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:23,259
do with size medium large and

196
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:24,999
extra-large

197
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:28,659
please turn safesearch on for your own

198
00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:31,029
protection I'm not going to share the

199
00:08:28,659 --> 00:08:34,120
details of everything that I saw when I

200
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:36,279
was looking at this but my ISP has that

201
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,019
and if you want you can contact them

202
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:40,769
gonna be happy to sell it to you I'm

203
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:43,299
sure no problem

204
00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:44,379
it's about being prepared knowing your

205
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:47,310
environment knowing where you're going

206
00:08:44,379 --> 00:08:50,410
right if you're walking into a boardroom

207
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:52,989
at a traditional company you've got to

208
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:57,219
dress the part which like it looked that

209
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:59,529
good you've got a dressed apart and your

210
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:01,930
security systems have to fit you the

211
00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:03,610
same way they have to fit you well so

212
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:05,620
that whatever you're preparing them for

213
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:08,620
whatever day you're going to have your

214
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:10,810
systems are ready for it so we're gonna

215
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:12,910
talk about points of view so we're going

216
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:14,680
to cover four points of view we're going

217
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:16,959
to cover in the trenches when you're

218
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,989
working when you're actually using the

219
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:21,969
clothes you're going to cover shopping

220
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:24,939
when you're buying clothes or buying the

221
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:26,889
security systems and a little bit from

222
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:28,480
the other side with the attacker seized

223
00:09:26,889 --> 00:09:30,160
and why you want them to see a certain

224
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:34,769
thing or not a little bit about style

225
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:36,670
and frameworks so from the trenches I

226
00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:39,189
couldn't I couldn't not show those

227
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:40,630
pictures from the trenches you got to

228
00:09:39,189 --> 00:09:43,060
know which trenches you're talking about

229
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:44,230
going into right for fashion are you in

230
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,939
World War one

231
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:47,699
are you walking into the hazmat

232
00:09:45,939 --> 00:09:52,120
environment I mentioned before are you

233
00:09:47,699 --> 00:09:54,490
going after neo in the matrix you have

234
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,959
to know ahead of time what exactly

235
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:58,199
you're you're trying to do with your

236
00:09:55,959 --> 00:10:00,130
security program you have to be prepared

237
00:09:58,199 --> 00:10:02,439
getting the right size at least as

238
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:03,550
important is knowing what you where

239
00:10:02,439 --> 00:10:05,319
you're going and what you need to wear

240
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:08,199
for that and I talked about the

241
00:10:05,319 --> 00:10:10,149
boardroom before and one of the things

242
00:10:08,199 --> 00:10:12,008
to remember is that even if you think

243
00:10:10,149 --> 00:10:16,240
you know what a boardroom should look

244
00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:17,800
like like if I get the chance to get

245
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,809
that pitch to that company in Manila

246
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,880
because I want to go back and live with

247
00:10:19,809 --> 00:10:23,139
some family there and then switch it

248
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,730
back and forth between totnes oh that

249
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:27,460
would be really cool

250
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:29,100
I'm going to know that in Manila you

251
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:33,250
wear belong to dialogue on a boardroom

252
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:35,020
so it's not as simple as I know what I

253
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:36,430
have to wear for this situation you have

254
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:38,670
to be sure you know everything about the

255
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:40,689
situation what's really about what's

256
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:42,790
what's your environment what's your

257
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:46,360
company what your company needs for

258
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:47,439
security what's what what are the

259
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,440
different environments will your company

260
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,900
needs to function well are you taking

261
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,760
your security program and applying it to

262
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,990
an environment that has a different

263
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,960
culture and has to have a different

264
00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:00,370
style for your security program now if

265
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:04,600
you have a program it's working really

266
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:06,780
great in Cambridge or Boston and you all

267
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,880
of a sudden acquire 50 developers

268
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:10,990
sitting in India you better make sure

269
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,070
that your security program is going to

270
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:14,530
match the culture the different

271
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:20,230
environments a lot of other problems in

272
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:21,610
there as well so what do you want to

273
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:23,310
wear today depends a lot on where you're

274
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:26,200
going

275
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:28,300
boardroom you're racking servers from

276
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:31,180
racking servers I do actually tuck the

277
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:34,750
tie in though I don't I still keep the

278
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:35,890
tie on but I tuck it in it's like what

279
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,150
what do you do

280
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:40,449
what's your security program have to

281
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:43,300
react to what's happening today right if

282
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:45,130
you're here sitting at B sides you're

283
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:48,880
not patching your Microsoft machines

284
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:50,980
this weekend right as an example are you

285
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:54,280
still running the broken Adobe that we

286
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:56,290
heard about recently what's what's

287
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,750
happening today and what tools you need

288
00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:00,699
to handle that and if you're working in

289
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,350
a small start-up and you've got 20

290
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:05,440
people in a room and that's your cubicle

291
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:07,180
farm then patching that there's a

292
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,360
completely different task than if you've

293
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:12,819
got 200 people spread across different

294
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,140
cities in in the country or if you've

295
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:16,270
got 2,000 people on different continents

296
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:18,819
right these are different security

297
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:22,270
programs completely different orders of

298
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:24,940
magnitude right in a small shop you can

299
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:26,199
stand up and say hey our IT guys coming

300
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:28,060
today is going to patch everything so

301
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,910
everybody just go away from 11:00 to

302
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:32,530
12:00 and you know it's done right

303
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:35,410
doesn't work when you've got multiple

304
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:36,439
cities or multiple continents so you got

305
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:38,180
to be sure

306
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,800
that the tools that you're using right

307
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:42,829
for your environment and right for where

308
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:47,359
your environment is going to go let's

309
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:50,510
talk a little bit about shopping as I

310
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,990
said I'm I'm a well okay I'll say I'm a

311
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:54,740
large but I'm going to be an extra-large

312
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:57,980
although I wish you were going the other

313
00:12:54,740 --> 00:13:01,670
way not many companies are going to tell

314
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:04,310
you we're really large and we want to

315
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:08,630
get smaller but that's not what

316
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:10,729
companies want to do you want to grow so

317
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:14,030
when you're buying a security solution

318
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:15,230
you want to buy a little bit extra to be

319
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:19,760
able to fit where you think you're going

320
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:23,750
to be in six months down the road too

321
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:30,610
small is really hard to fix too large

322
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:32,810
can usually be tucked in sorry

323
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:34,850
the other point I want to make here is

324
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:40,430
about how long you're going to own stuff

325
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:42,260
I don't like to dryclean stuff it's not

326
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:43,550
that I don't like that particular fabric

327
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:45,110
it's that I don't want to pay for

328
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:47,959
dry-cleaning every time I spill

329
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:51,290
something on my shirt or my jacket it's

330
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:53,480
just ridiculous because I spill coffee

331
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:55,370
it happens these things happen

332
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:59,530
that means general upkeep and dry clean

333
00:13:55,370 --> 00:14:03,320
suit is going to be a lot more than not

334
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:05,060
if you're talking to a vendor or looking

335
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,500
at a solution and they're telling you

336
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:09,979
this is great you're going to love it

337
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:11,240
it's just awesome you want to talk to

338
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:13,280
people who are using because if you find

339
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:15,950
out oh by the way this great tool

340
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:19,069
ArcSight requires an entire FTE just to

341
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:20,839
keep it running you might want to say

342
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:22,940
hold on a second I don't have a

343
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:25,010
full-time person for that or you may be

344
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:26,770
a great University and say we got three

345
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:28,580
people we'll throw it that that's great

346
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:31,640
but you got to be sure that whatever

347
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:34,070
you're doing fits your environment will

348
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,180
it last for your environment is it is it

349
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:37,270
the right size for where you want to be

350
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:39,650
in six months

351
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:41,600
you don't want to get too big obviously

352
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:44,900
to want to spend the budget it can also

353
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,280
look a little silly and and the thing

354
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:48,459
I've been harping on all this time is

355
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:50,050
one size doesn't fit all in security

356
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:52,420
there are places

357
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:55,630
where you just want to be a Cisco shop

358
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:57,370
and they're places where really you want

359
00:14:55,630 --> 00:15:02,170
to do stuff by hand because you're super

360
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:05,080
paranoid or whatever each environment is

361
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:07,899
different in each has its merits but you

362
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:10,089
want to keep in mind that you're what

363
00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:12,190
you're looking at for your security

364
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:14,560
solution may not be what the vendor had

365
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:16,240
mind when they told their marketing

366
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,349
person to give you a call on the phone

367
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,040
and tell you how awesome their tool is

368
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:22,720
you're the one who's to be on the hook

369
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:28,630
for making it work the way it's supposed

370
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:32,950
to not the vendor so the point of view

371
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:35,769
of an attacker I'm short on time preview

372
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:37,990
an attacker I'm not talking specific

373
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:39,700
about a physical attack against clothing

374
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:41,260
so but that's a physical tax or

375
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:45,399
different class or not covering that

376
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:46,600
here but if you think of attacks against

377
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:47,589
clothing as what is it clothing trying

378
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,740
to defend against your clothing is

379
00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:51,970
trying to keep you warm your clothing is

380
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:54,100
trying to protect you from the elements

381
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:57,520
give you a place to put your valuable

382
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:59,980
stuff and to make you convey the image

383
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:03,160
that you want to convey right this is

384
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:07,329
this is how big looks this is just it

385
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:09,880
this is the image I convey if I'm

386
00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:13,209
walking into a computer room this may

387
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:14,880
not convey the image that I want to talk

388
00:16:13,209 --> 00:16:19,239
to people who sit at a keyboard all day

389
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:20,860
because I may look like a sales guy so

390
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,020
you want to be sure that your clothing

391
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:25,630
convey the image you want and you want

392
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:27,670
your we're stretching it a little bit

393
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:30,670
here you want your security tools to

394
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:32,500
convey the right image to your employees

395
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:35,699
about the culture of your company as

396
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:37,899
well as to your potential investors

397
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:39,969
people who may want to spend money on

398
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:42,970
your company going to be sure that that

399
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:45,550
you're conveying the right image for

400
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:47,410
everyone who's going to be looking at

401
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:49,209
your security program a lot of the time

402
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:52,149
its customers we've had a lot of people

403
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:55,930
who are contacting customers of ours

404
00:16:52,149 --> 00:16:57,699
saying here here's a 10 page

405
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:59,620
questionnaire or a twenty page query I

406
00:16:57,699 --> 00:17:02,020
see the head nodding tell us a bunch of

407
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:03,950
security program and you better believe

408
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:05,119
that there are questions on page two

409
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:07,310
that are double-checking answers you

410
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,479
give on page nine because they want to

411
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:10,280
be sure that you're not lying about it

412
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,170
and then you hand that off and you think

413
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:17,629
you're done and then they send you back

414
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:19,190
hey you said that you do antivirus it

415
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:21,829
using this concept and that you keep

416
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:23,720
your logs show us the logs they want

417
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:26,050
evidence they want you to tell the truth

418
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,800
and they're going to make you prove it

419
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,909
it's like they really care about

420
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:45,620
security or something

421
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:47,990
yeah I don't have a good answer for that

422
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:51,020
I'm stretching the analogy a little bit

423
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:52,510
here sometimes you actually want to tell

424
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:56,510
the attacker things that are not true

425
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:57,710
you want to change honey pots or you

426
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:59,680
want to change the banners that you're

427
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:01,970
advertising on us is a demon or on your

428
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,740
HTTP demon to say a version that they're

429
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:05,270
not and then watch for the faulty

430
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:08,090
attacks come in which is kind of fun in

431
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:11,210
a weird sort of way

432
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:13,730
but I don't have a way to say that you

433
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:17,330
don't want you know I'll use it again

434
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:19,370
arcsight instead of what alienvault

435
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:20,899
cubed ro sim right I don't have a way to

436
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:24,080
say that you don't want that so the

437
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:26,000
attacker to see that it breaks down a

438
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:34,280
little bit here I'm ripping the analogy

439
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:36,830
if you'll permit me link but the some of

440
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:41,300
the things apply you are you are using

441
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:44,270
your security program to protect you

442
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:46,280
from adverse outcomes bad whether you

443
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:49,490
are using it to protect your stuff your

444
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:50,750
valuables but you're right the analogy

445
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:56,800
doesn't doesn't hold all the way here

446
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:59,020
you got me but my next slide is so cool

447
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:02,039
okay though

448
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:02,039
no that's okay

449
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:36,159
the norm in the industries to hide as

450
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:37,840
much as you can but it kills some tools

451
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:39,760
are required to put out certain

452
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,070
information here's some things you can't

453
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:49,120
hide but really eventually on the body

454
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:50,559
that you're actually projecting some of

455
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,959
it's not necessarily to the attacker

456
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,490
it's to the other folks in your

457
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,429
organization it's making it fit you

458
00:19:54,490 --> 00:20:00,640
organization so for instance if you're a

459
00:19:57,429 --> 00:20:03,850
small one location shop and you're doing

460
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,350
a big giant implementation of I started

461
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:07,658
so I'll keep going the park site right

462
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:10,090
that's insane for a tiny little shop

463
00:20:07,659 --> 00:20:13,809
right are sites for like you know thirty

464
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:15,399
thousand computers right so what you

465
00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:17,980
don't want to secure a program that's

466
00:20:15,399 --> 00:20:19,899
too big for you this is the segue to my

467
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:21,460
next picture you don't want it too big

468
00:20:19,899 --> 00:20:23,168
for you because then if it's too big you

469
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:24,340
it'll may protect you in some areas but

470
00:20:23,169 --> 00:20:26,890
you spent money so you don't have

471
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:30,449
protection in other places and it's hard

472
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:34,659
to move quickly there we go

473
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:37,320
so so the the big giant program the big

474
00:20:34,659 --> 00:20:39,700
giant tool can be hard to be agile with

475
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,779
right you're right it's not necessarily

476
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,159
in point of view of the attacker that I

477
00:20:40,779 --> 00:20:44,409
don't want them to think that I'm

478
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:47,260
running where were alienvault for my sim

479
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:48,640
but from the point of view of being able

480
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,110
to move around in my organization and

481
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,360
make a difference quickly I don't want

482
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:53,799
something that's too big because you

483
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:57,879
couldn't move quickly although they look

484
00:20:53,799 --> 00:21:02,889
pretty happy but move on to the point of

485
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:05,080
view of style of frameworks and I'm

486
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:07,000
stretching the analogy again but I'm

487
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:09,639
saying that a security framework

488
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,310
whatever you're using for organizing

489
00:21:09,639 --> 00:21:16,629
your security program is similar to

490
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:18,340
your style of your fashion so this is if

491
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:19,750
I said this is this is how big dresses

492
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:22,629
this is it

493
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:25,300
when I'm going to shop I'm not shopping

494
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:28,630
when Hitler would shop because it looks

495
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:31,899
cooler than I do I couldn't pull off the

496
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:37,780
shirt like that this is what I got now

497
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:44,680
we talked about that that's because I'm

498
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:45,820
an extra large so the you want to be

499
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:48,700
sure that your style is fitting your

500
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:52,270
organization there are there are people

501
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:53,680
I haven't seen people in particular I'm

502
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,940
thinking about at this conference but

503
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,800
the people who will tell you that you

504
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:58,750
can't use NIST to develop your security

505
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:02,649
framework it's not big enough it's not

506
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:04,060
good enough this won't work and heavens

507
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:06,700
bid you talk about using the CIA's top

508
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:11,290
20 because that's just tiny and yet from

509
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:14,260
talking to a company that has 30 people

510
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:15,879
that's the whole company and I start

511
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:17,470
talking about the CIA's top 20 right

512
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:19,330
they could stay just hand of a top to

513
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:21,700
write inventory of the devices in your

514
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:23,919
environment just give me an inventory of

515
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:25,420
the devices simple everybody knows you

516
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,130
can start with that inventory the

517
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:28,180
software but they don't have to go even

518
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:29,320
down to the bottom 20 and they've

519
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,390
already made a huge difference in their

520
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:35,470
environment right on the other hand if

521
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:38,140
you're you know GE if you better be

522
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:40,930
using ISO right you need a real program

523
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:42,580
that handles it enterprise-wide so

524
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:44,580
figure out what's appropriate for your

525
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:46,659
environment and be sure that you're

526
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:52,320
acting appropriately that you have the

527
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:54,460
right style for what you want to do so

528
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,780
pulling at you a little bit hard here

529
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:57,130
but I think you see what I'm getting at

530
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:59,170
is want to pick the right framework if

531
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:01,750
you're in the government supply chain we

532
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:03,730
have customers that manufactured pivot

533
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:06,280
if you're making chips that go into

534
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:08,230
circuit boards that go into modules that

535
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,490
go into jet fighters for the military

536
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:11,740
you're in the government supply chain

537
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:14,080
and you better be looking at this 171

538
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:15,040
even if you're only a 20% shop because

539
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,980
you're going to get the questionnaires

540
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:19,659
from the Raytheon's or though all the

541
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:21,370
way down all the way down to you to say

542
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:22,940
tell me about your security program or I

543
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:25,669
can't buy from you the SEM

544
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:27,470
20:17 and so you have to figure out

545
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:29,570
what's right for your environment for

546
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:31,130
the size of your company based on what

547
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:36,230
you've got going on in addition to your

548
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:39,070
to your size and you want to be sure

549
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:42,460
that that what you fit what you get

550
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:44,389
doesn't have any unintended consequences

551
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:46,640
because the vendor may tell you this

552
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:47,990
looks really great on you really really

553
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,430
though this this appliance will look

554
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:53,510
really grating it server accent too

555
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:55,370
pretty color it has blinking lights but

556
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:57,680
when you put it in and it starts running

557
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:59,239
is it not right for you is it going to

558
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,280
get caught in that will tell me that's

559
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,330
not going to get caught in that wheel

560
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:04,220
she's coming off the back of that and

561
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:09,260
and I want to talk about the guy with

562
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:12,020
the shredder Italian sorry stop touching

563
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:13,760
the day so be sure that whatever you're

564
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:15,190
looking at is right for what you plan to

565
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,830
do in the real world

566
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:19,910
not just what the vendor says or the

567
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:23,620
sales person who's trying to sell you

568
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:26,450
whatever the services happen to be so

569
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:27,919
now we're to the the part I promise

570
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:31,730
we're going to talk about medium to

571
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:34,340
small businesses I've separated them by

572
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:36,440
size extra small do it yourself

573
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:40,669
limited to no budget small medium large

574
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:42,920
extra large there are many different

575
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:45,470
ways to figure out what you think people

576
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,970
should be spending on IT security what

577
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:49,910
you think your your company should be

578
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:52,460
spending the best evidence from Gartner

579
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:55,070
has to do with industry because IT

580
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:56,930
spending is dependent on industry and IT

581
00:24:55,070 --> 00:25:00,980
security spending is typically dependent

582
00:24:56,930 --> 00:25:02,360
on that we're technical people here

583
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,830
right you know I had this spreadsheet

584
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,600
with all these dimensions and the

585
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:07,310
multiple values by industry and the

586
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,350
multiple values by different sizes of

587
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:12,080
security programming and yeah but it

588
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:13,639
doesn't work in a presentation so I took

589
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,280
the average of North America which is

590
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:18,140
three point five percent two point five

591
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:20,389
percent of revenue is your IT program

592
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:22,510
and ten percent of that variety security

593
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:24,830
and that's how these numbers came to be

594
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:27,790
these are rough numbers for comparison

595
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:29,990
only I'm not saying that if you have

596
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:31,280
twenty five million in revenue that you

597
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:31,790
have seven three hundred to spend I'm

598
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,560
saying

599
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:34,370
relative to the others they're useful

600
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:37,399
numbers

601
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:39,229
and I doubt the ones in gray at the top

602
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:42,289
I think a lot of small companies don't

603
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:44,679
even have that but this is the rough

604
00:25:42,289 --> 00:25:48,890
sizing I'm talking about for comparison

605
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:50,360
and this is just the slide with

606
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:55,990
different small medium/large because it

607
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:58,639
had to go into presentation somewhere so

608
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:59,659
taking those same extra

609
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,870
small-extra-large

610
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:05,690
and start talking about what what people

611
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:09,289
can actually do so the dollars per month

612
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:12,590
is across the top the people that you

613
00:26:09,289 --> 00:26:13,970
have is the second line that should be

614
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:16,340
less than one person not greater than

615
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:19,730
one person you if you're a small company

616
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:21,350
you've got you know 20 people you don't

617
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:25,070
have a whole person dedicated IP let

618
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:30,279
alone IT security if you're a small

619
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:32,960
company you've got an IT person probably

620
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:35,690
but that person is also going to be

621
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:38,510
doing IT security so you got part of a

622
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:42,110
person who's doing the car driven system

623
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:45,220
right who's doing patching for antivirus

624
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:48,219
who's doing awareness for security

625
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:50,029
that's all coming out of your IT person

626
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:51,620
when you get to be a medium-sized

627
00:26:50,029 --> 00:26:53,690
company you got a whole person that one

628
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:54,229
FTE to do that security work which is

629
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:56,270
awesome

630
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:58,070
large gets a department next large gets

631
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:59,720
a big department they're not going to be

632
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:01,760
the focus for the rest of this they're

633
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:04,039
the other ones with lots of money and

634
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,529
would be nice to be there but a lot of

635
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:12,679
companies are not in that situation if

636
00:27:06,529 --> 00:27:17,090
you're go ahead I'll get that but thank

637
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:20,240
you it's coming it's next so this line

638
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:23,029
is antivirus if you're running a BG and

639
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,830
you're a small company check the License

640
00:27:23,029 --> 00:27:27,559
Agreement because I'm the only person in

641
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:31,100
the world who reads it and you can find

642
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:32,720
one that's free better if you don't use

643
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,610
one that might cause you a problem later

644
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,860
but you're doing something but you're

645
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:37,580
doing a free service if you're small

646
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:39,918
you've got commercial-off-the-shelf

647
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:42,110
you're buying semantics or Kaspersky or

648
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,669
McAfee or whatever if you're

649
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:45,260
medium-sized company you have a console

650
00:27:43,669 --> 00:27:46,460
which is awesome you can track all of

651
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:47,960
your machines and all your antivirus

652
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:50,509
right

653
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:52,940
now it's a little bit we've all seen

654
00:27:50,509 --> 00:27:54,499
this right consoles anyway you're

655
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:56,090
tracking all of your different machines

656
00:27:54,499 --> 00:27:58,039
and making sure they're up-to-date

657
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:59,330
you're getting alerts but say hey this

658
00:27:58,039 --> 00:28:01,899
machine has been on the network for a

659
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:05,830
week and it's antivirus without a date

660
00:28:01,899 --> 00:28:08,239
if you're large you have consoles

661
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:09,379
because you've got consoles working with

662
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,210
each other you've got a Mac at the

663
00:28:09,379 --> 00:28:13,009
console and you've got your cue radar

664
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:14,179
console and they've got all these

665
00:28:13,009 --> 00:28:15,889
different consoles that are working

666
00:28:14,179 --> 00:28:18,110
together because when you're meeting you

667
00:28:15,889 --> 00:28:20,498
can only afford one seaboard antivirus

668
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:22,428
because that vendor got to you first

669
00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:23,659
extra large covers and vulnerability

670
00:28:22,429 --> 00:28:24,110
management programs which are really

671
00:28:23,659 --> 00:28:25,340
cool

672
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:26,658
but they're out of reach for small to

673
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:29,840
medium sized companies it's not going to

674
00:28:26,659 --> 00:28:30,350
happen if you're training let me

675
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,809
rephrase that

676
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:34,549
when you're training your employees

677
00:28:32,809 --> 00:28:36,470
about information security because that

678
00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:40,820
matters because people are the weakest

679
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:43,309
link right we're training people telling

680
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:46,668
them don't click on the link it should

681
00:28:43,309 --> 00:28:47,658
be a chant at a small company you're

682
00:28:46,669 --> 00:28:49,389
just talking to people being sure that

683
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:52,190
they just know right

684
00:28:49,389 --> 00:28:53,748
that's an extra small that's small you

685
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:55,279
may be gathering together at lunch to

686
00:28:53,749 --> 00:28:57,499
have a single conversation and covered

687
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:59,960
in a class where you stand there and you

688
00:28:57,499 --> 00:29:03,409
say this is how you're not going to

689
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:05,269
click on the link the note that says

690
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:09,950
it's from the director of the FBI is not

691
00:29:05,269 --> 00:29:13,429
to you really people medium you're doing

692
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:14,690
online online training is ok better if

693
00:29:13,429 --> 00:29:16,519
you can hire a trainer to come in and do

694
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:19,249
the job right the larger an extra large

695
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:22,279
company taking people off site for

696
00:29:19,249 --> 00:29:25,279
backups at a small company you've got a

697
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:27,649
USB Drive preferably not a little USB

698
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,490
stick a real USB Drive and you're taking

699
00:29:27,649 --> 00:29:30,498
it with you home

700
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:34,340
and bringing it back and you get to be a

701
00:29:30,499 --> 00:29:37,039
small company you've got two USB drives

702
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:38,959
at home and two USB drives at the office

703
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:40,908
and you back up to one and then you take

704
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,220
that one with you you still got one at

705
00:29:40,909 --> 00:29:44,299
the office now you put that one here and

706
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:46,009
you take the other one from home and

707
00:29:44,299 --> 00:29:50,240
bring it back you've always got backups

708
00:29:46,009 --> 00:29:52,190
off-site and up-to-date geographic

709
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,980
distribution at least within wherever

710
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:56,809
your IT person lives so you can do a

711
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:59,059
real backup solution for a small company

712
00:29:56,809 --> 00:30:00,690
without actually spending more than the

713
00:29:59,059 --> 00:30:04,408
cost of a USB Drive

714
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:05,399
right these are the solutions part we

715
00:30:04,409 --> 00:30:07,710
were talking about before

716
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:09,149
if you medium you do more either real

717
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:10,859
off-site you work with Iron Mountain

718
00:30:09,149 --> 00:30:13,738
large and extra-large they have other

719
00:30:10,859 --> 00:30:17,699
cool stuff that they're doing but you

720
00:30:13,739 --> 00:30:19,049
get the point so the reason to believe

721
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:22,649
in all this about small and medium-sized

722
00:30:19,049 --> 00:30:25,109
business is this so this a while ago in

723
00:30:22,649 --> 00:30:29,449
it it made sense based on risk tolerance

724
00:30:25,109 --> 00:30:33,599
for small companies but sixty percent

725
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:36,779
after they have a cyber attack gone in

726
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:39,539
six months so if you're talking with

727
00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:42,749
small and medium sized business they've

728
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:44,460
got real risk now when you start a

729
00:30:42,749 --> 00:30:47,879
company small you take on a lot of risk

730
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:49,889
right to go a bigger take a little less

731
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:51,149
risk because you've now got some more

732
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:52,918
money invested and things are working

733
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:54,539
well by the time you get to be a

734
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:56,039
medium-sized company you've got people

735
00:30:54,539 --> 00:30:57,929
depending on you for payroll every day

736
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:59,369
you may have 3040 people who need that

737
00:30:57,929 --> 00:31:02,039
payroll you can't be taking the same

738
00:30:59,369 --> 00:31:03,299
risks you were taken back here right so

739
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:05,580
it's understandable that you take on

740
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:07,320
more risk but small companies should

741
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,609
know that they're taking on this risk

742
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:12,349
and not just bear the risk without

743
00:31:08,609 --> 00:31:14,759
understanding it right

744
00:31:12,349 --> 00:31:18,239
sixty percent out of business after a

745
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:19,979
cyber attack not prepared not ready to

746
00:31:18,239 --> 00:31:23,429
handle the aftermath I don't have the

747
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:26,970
details on that obviously but so that's

748
00:31:23,429 --> 00:31:31,349
a bad number what I'm talking about for

749
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:33,720
small business is time versus money when

750
00:31:31,349 --> 00:31:35,639
you're running a small company you don't

751
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,109
have a lot of money if you do that would

752
00:31:35,639 --> 00:31:40,199
be awesome and I want you to invest in

753
00:31:37,109 --> 00:31:41,879
my small company but typically you don't

754
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,679
have a lot of money you just can't spend

755
00:31:41,879 --> 00:31:46,738
the money you don't have it so you're

756
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:48,629
spending time as you grow that will

757
00:31:46,739 --> 00:31:50,220
change and there's a theoretical

758
00:31:48,629 --> 00:31:53,459
crossover point I don't have units on

759
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:56,580
here for a reason but the idea is you're

760
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:59,009
spending time to get things done so a

761
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:02,699
lot of small business security is about

762
00:31:59,009 --> 00:32:04,889
time management if you say I'm going to

763
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:06,690
periodically check my whisp because I'm

764
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:07,649
a company in Massachusetts I know that I

765
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:11,879
have to have a written information

766
00:32:07,649 --> 00:32:13,619
security program and that the law says I

767
00:32:11,879 --> 00:32:14,219
have to check it every year with 1207

768
00:32:13,619 --> 00:32:17,610
visa

769
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:20,250
every year right then you better put a

770
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:21,928
tickler on your schedule to say after

771
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:24,659
year I got a check-in as a security

772
00:32:21,929 --> 00:32:27,000
person because if you're the security

773
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:29,070
person who's operating as I've been

774
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,610
there I handle whatever I can out of my

775
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:32,220
Inbox

776
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:34,049
I can't scroll to the bottom the next

777
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:35,340
day I handle what I can out of my inbox

778
00:32:34,049 --> 00:32:39,179
and these messages are not getting seen

779
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:40,549
right there are some networks where if

780
00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:42,419
you lose a packet it's no big deal

781
00:32:40,549 --> 00:32:46,500
and some networks are if you lose a

782
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:48,210
packet the plane crashes if you're the

783
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,649
IT security and you've got a note in

784
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:51,779
there that says your website's been

785
00:32:49,649 --> 00:32:53,668
hacked and you need to do something

786
00:32:51,779 --> 00:32:55,379
about this now and you didn't see it

787
00:32:53,669 --> 00:32:57,960
because it was below the fold or below

788
00:32:55,379 --> 00:33:00,029
the scroll line on your email and your

789
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,409
company's in deep trouble so if you're

790
00:33:00,029 --> 00:33:02,669
running an IT security program at a

791
00:33:01,409 --> 00:33:03,600
small company you've got to be very sure

792
00:33:02,669 --> 00:33:05,309
that you're careful with your time

793
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,719
management if you set these things up

794
00:33:05,309 --> 00:33:07,950
and that you're watching all the

795
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:12,450
information is coming in to you which

796
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:13,559
can be really really difficult we sue

797
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:16,289
you budget time to view things

798
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:18,990
periodically we've been talking about

799
00:33:16,289 --> 00:33:20,879
the typical vendor presentation I'm not

800
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:22,919
down on vendors I'm ok with vendors they

801
00:33:20,879 --> 00:33:26,129
do good stuff but a lot of times their

802
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:28,470
slides look like this right if you're

803
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:30,120
extra small we can't help you if you're

804
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:31,710
small we can give you something but if

805
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:35,250
you spend a lot of money boy have we got

806
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:41,759
a long list for you right you've seen

807
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:43,500
these but for you this is the diagram if

808
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:46,679
you're a small company you can find

809
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:49,409
stuff just not with that vendor right

810
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:52,019
you can't afford the big giant gorgeous

811
00:33:49,409 --> 00:33:54,539
console if you're at a tiny company so

812
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:58,230
don't talk to them unless they're going

813
00:33:54,539 --> 00:33:59,908
to buy you lunch just go look for the

814
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:01,559
solution that fits what you need to do

815
00:33:59,909 --> 00:34:04,919
you can do something no matter your size

816
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:09,210
so we're talking about these size

817
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:10,980
companies for now this time we have five

818
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:17,710
minutes

819
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:19,420
okay so again we're talking about extra

820
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:21,429
small companies that have almost no

821
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:22,690
budget too small to medium-sized

822
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:28,290
companies have real budget can have a

823
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:31,990
real person working there it's about

824
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:34,509
having your mindset that there are

825
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:36,669
solutions that I can use they have to

826
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:38,890
pick the right ones that don't break my

827
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:41,650
budget and don't take too much of my

828
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:42,969
time you've got to balance what you're

829
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:45,370
doing and what you're buying to be sure

830
00:34:42,969 --> 00:34:46,569
that it's right for your company and

831
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:48,969
remember the big picture is your

832
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:50,170
security program not whether

833
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:51,850
thoroughness would be a really cool

834
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:53,230
solution because you can backtrack and

835
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:56,650
watch what happened on the file system

836
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:58,180
right that's awesome stuff but if you're

837
00:34:56,650 --> 00:35:02,020
a small company I'm sorry it's not a

838
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:03,580
scope it's just it's not it's too

839
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:05,290
expensive it solves only one solution

840
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:08,380
and you're leaving yourself wide open in

841
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:12,340
other areas so if you're doing inventory

842
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:14,380
and you have some specific examples my

843
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:17,260
example before with the the 20 people in

844
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:19,540
a room small startup their cubicles 20

845
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:22,660
people in a room right you can do

846
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:24,970
inventory on a piece of paper really you

847
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:26,560
can it's not fun but you can you can

848
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:28,870
walk around with a black magic marker

849
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,250
and tack the Machine I wrote down the

850
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:31,960
serial number and go to the next one and

851
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:33,040
then the next month or the next year

852
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,660
when you have to the inventory again use

853
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,820
a different color magic marker and you

854
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:38,170
can do inventory for no budget you don't

855
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:39,640
have to listen to the vendor who wants

856
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:41,110
to sell you this awesome tool that will

857
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:47,230
go to automatically inventory your

858
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:48,990
machines of course if you graduate to

859
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:53,260
having more time than you can script it

860
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:54,609
which is even cooler of course a

861
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:56,650
medium-sized company will buy the tool

862
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:57,850
and they'll have it automated so that

863
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:59,020
we've been a real inventory that then

864
00:35:57,850 --> 00:36:01,060
they can get a report item instead they

865
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:02,170
have to work with Excel or have somebody

866
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:03,430
else work with Excel because you can't

867
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:07,710
someone else on a company to do it for

868
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:11,250
you patching we already talked about

869
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:11,250
bring your own device

870
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:14,600
I've heard a lot of people say I'm in a

871
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:16,640
small company I can't help bring BYOD I

872
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:20,960
can't be done there's nothing I can do

873
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:22,549
and I argue that's not true if you want

874
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,690
to handle bring your own device and

875
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:27,250
you've got a company with almost no

876
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:29,960
budget you get a guest access point and

877
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:31,490
you take the password for that access

878
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:34,010
point because we secure all of our

879
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:35,540
access points right everybody secure all

880
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:37,790
of our access points none of them going

881
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:39,920
secure but take the password you put it

882
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:42,110
up on the wall I wouldn't write it on

883
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,190
this wall but you put it up on the wall

884
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:44,510
you put on the whiteboard you let people

885
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:46,130
know this is the pass for the guest

886
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:47,900
access point and you leave it alone and

887
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:49,930
you let it stay that way for a year or

888
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:52,760
two years however long you want it to go

889
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:56,180
then you change the password on your

890
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:57,980
internal access point and you only put

891
00:36:56,180 --> 00:37:02,509
that on machines that you know our

892
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:05,000
company owned and then a month later you

893
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:07,040
change it again because somebody's going

894
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,420
to have caught it but you keep you

895
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,560
rotate that every once in a while and

896
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,820
all of a sudden you've got to bring your

897
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,590
own device policy because everyone who

898
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,760
brought in their iPhone or their iPad or

899
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:16,220
anything else they want to do the stream

900
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,050
their movies is now stuck on the guest

901
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:19,160
network because you keep changing the

902
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:22,220
flip and password they get tired of

903
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:25,160
coming and asking you about it bring

904
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:29,390
your own device free policy though you

905
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:31,549
had to buy an Access Point right like

906
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:33,830
that small company that's too small no

907
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:35,930
budget of course yes if you've got

908
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:37,310
budget and you can afford an AK go for

909
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:39,379
it they're awesome you can kick people

910
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:41,240
off automatically and there's a middle

911
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:42,410
ground with scripting where you're

912
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:45,680
watching your network and you're

913
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:47,450
watching the the MAC addresses go by and

914
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,879
you're filtering by vendor and your

915
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:51,950
chain you can you can script this and

916
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,720
you can hire somebody to script it but

917
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:55,970
it can be done on a sort of a middle

918
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:57,919
ground when you got more time but for a

919
00:37:55,970 --> 00:38:00,560
quick simple solution just change the

920
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:02,240
access point and lock people out you'll

921
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,890
find out who's using it you'll see them

922
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:09,160
at their desk going why doesn't this

923
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:10,940
work so user education we talk about

924
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:13,069
antivirus we talked about you can use

925
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:17,440
komodo it's free free for commercial

926
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:17,440
entities you don't have to use AVG

927
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:27,770
got two more of these and then the

928
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:29,360
clothes so disk encryption yes you can

929
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:31,100
do disk encryption as a small company

930
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:34,670
what scares people out is what if they

931
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:37,160
change the passphrase on me so you have

932
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:41,090
a rescue phrase you when you when you do

933
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:42,890
it you use a product or a UNIX tool that

934
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:48,050
will let you save the underlying

935
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:49,879
passphrase the typically the way disk

936
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:51,290
encryption works is you've got an

937
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,850
encrypted disk and you're going to

938
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:56,060
algorithm from crippling the disk and

939
00:38:52,850 --> 00:39:00,170
you've got a big long key and that's the

940
00:38:56,060 --> 00:39:02,840
key for the desk then you have people

941
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:05,930
enter their own key and that encrypts

942
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:08,300
this special key so that's what gets

943
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:10,669
saved this hash in the middle and then

944
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:12,740
we get rid of the first two and this is

945
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:14,180
people have to match and anything that

946
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:16,160
it's used to generate this that it

947
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:18,379
decrypts the drive well you can save the

948
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:20,750
intermediary key when you're installing

949
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:22,820
it when you're setting it up any product

950
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:24,860
worth its salt for instance the free one

951
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:26,060
on linux will give you that key that you

952
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:27,860
can save you can write it down it's

953
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:29,150
really long you put it in a safe and if

954
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:30,290
somebody says haha

955
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:31,580
I changed the key and I'm leaving the

956
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:33,560
company you can't have that computer

957
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:40,270
sure you can you get the key in their

958
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:42,620
safe so disk encryption free it's a pain

959
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:44,780
writing stuff on paper and putting it in

960
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:46,040
a safe is a pain but it will work and if

961
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:48,830
you're free and all you've got is time

962
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:50,150
and no money you're small other there's

963
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:55,250
time enough money there's a solution

964
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:57,470
that'll work obviously be better to have

965
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:59,240
a console you can control it or at least

966
00:39:57,470 --> 00:40:01,189
centrally managed for this encryption

967
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:02,450
that's better if you can afford it but

968
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,860
if you can't afford it and you need this

969
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:05,870
concretion because you happen to have

970
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:07,490
social security numbers or driver's

971
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:09,049
license numbers or credit card numbers

972
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:11,839
or anything that Massachusetts says is

973
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:13,730
PII or even the government supply chain

974
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,930
you have to enlist 171 then for crying

975
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:17,750
out loud you've got to encrypt there's

976
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:19,370
no we don't want to because we don't

977
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:25,490
because we can't afford it you've got

978
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:27,440
two brand alerts this is free for

979
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:29,799
everybody then you can hire a company to

980
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:32,089
watch the brand but

981
00:40:29,799 --> 00:40:35,509
I've set these up for multiple customers

982
00:40:32,089 --> 00:40:38,029
where I'm watching for their customer

983
00:40:35,509 --> 00:40:41,809
name just the domain name also the

984
00:40:38,029 --> 00:40:48,500
customer name on free sites like paste

985
00:40:41,809 --> 00:40:49,849
bin right yeah uh-huh yep and you see

986
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:54,170
some interesting stuff go by and paste

987
00:40:49,849 --> 00:40:57,289
bin but if you're watching for your

988
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:59,420
customers name there or that was me I'm

989
00:40:57,289 --> 00:41:01,009
sorry if you're a company and you're

990
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:03,500
watching for your company name there

991
00:41:01,009 --> 00:41:05,450
then you're going to see when someone is

992
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:07,190
saying hey look I broke into Acme

993
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:10,339
widgets look at the cool stuff I got or

994
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:12,380
I'm daxing the CEO isn't as cool and he

995
00:41:10,339 --> 00:41:14,538
works at acne is your Google Alert which

996
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:15,200
you set up a free we'll kick that to you

997
00:41:14,539 --> 00:41:17,180
right away

998
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:20,210
you can go get it off pay spam and tell

999
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:24,740
people to don't click the link in the

1000
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:26,779
email obviously you can do more stuff we

1001
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:29,959
hire companies to monitor your brand and

1002
00:41:26,779 --> 00:41:34,990
so forth but but this is free right we

1003
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:37,990
talked about backups DNS web proxy yes

1004
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:37,990
yeah

1005
00:41:46,070 --> 00:42:03,630
yep exactly and and and what you're

1006
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:05,070
doing is you're you're looking at what

1007
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:06,750
would an attacker be doing the opponent

1008
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:09,210
pastebin their Pirate Bay and and you're

1009
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:11,340
watching for their activity and you're

1010
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:15,510
doing it for free it's a great example

1011
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:16,500
because in if you're running a software

1012
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:18,090
company you know what you could be

1013
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,320
looking for to catch your stuff as it

1014
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:25,680
went out not just your company name

1015
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:27,660
obviously well yeah in my province

1016
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:30,029
that's a that's an attacker they're

1017
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:32,430
inside they've got access but that's an

1018
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:37,680
attacker yeah no you're right you're

1019
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:39,779
looking for you're looking for bad

1020
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:42,990
actors doing stuff and and these ones

1021
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:46,110
happen to be inside you're right but

1022
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:49,140
yeah that's that's a great example we

1023
00:42:46,110 --> 00:43:00,420
talk about backups DNS web proxy yeah

1024
00:42:49,140 --> 00:43:01,890
good that's like um snack overflow I'm

1025
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:05,070
sure your developers would never do this

1026
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:08,359
but pasting code from your company

1027
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:11,460
asking questions right so you know

1028
00:43:08,359 --> 00:43:13,890
periodically checking that seeing if you

1029
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:16,790
know your company comm shows up on Stack

1030
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:18,900
Overflow is a is a good way to see if

1031
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:21,180
you know you have a overanxious

1032
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:24,690
developer that may be leaking some your

1033
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:27,660
source code yeah leaking it yeah oh yeah

1034
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:29,190
I totally buy into it yeah yeah yeah

1035
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:32,490
well cleansing that stuff can be hard I

1036
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:35,210
was in a hurry yeah you can look for

1037
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:40,589
your IP addresses in there as well so

1038
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:42,420
yeah DNS web proxy sometimes people at a

1039
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:43,950
company want to go places on the

1040
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:48,570
internet that would be inappropriate for

1041
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:51,060
work sometimes this happens sometimes

1042
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:53,570
the places that they're going to want to

1043
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:56,040
download malware onto their computer and

1044
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:58,200
having set up alerts in systems like

1045
00:43:56,040 --> 00:44:01,050
your radar to say hey look this

1046
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:03,390
she went out then after going out to

1047
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:04,589
this place we don't like then it started

1048
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:08,848
attacking her the machine on the network

1049
00:44:04,589 --> 00:44:10,740
so this really does happen web proxies

1050
00:44:08,849 --> 00:44:13,079
are great if you can afford a web proxy

1051
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:14,910
to lock things down to just the sites

1052
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:18,119
you want that's awesome but if you can't

1053
00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:20,690
you can control the DNS on your network

1054
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:23,220
now you're not going to stop someone who

1055
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:25,290
works in this room who knows that they

1056
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:26,459
can go there have their own DNS or they

1057
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:28,560
can tunnel their DNA you're not going to

1058
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:30,599
stop security people right but you're

1059
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:32,070
going to stop the regular person sitting

1060
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:34,020
at their desk who happens to click on

1061
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:35,579
links hey take a look at this right

1062
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:38,430
you're going to stop them because the

1063
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:41,070
site doesn't resolve now Open DNS had a

1064
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:42,779
solution this is it's still free I think

1065
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:46,079
Open DNS isn't francisco has a free one

1066
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:51,990
ok so the there are three solutions

1067
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:54,510
Cisco my mic sorry yeah it still use it

1068
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:57,899
at my house I yeah they have them shut

1069
00:44:54,510 --> 00:45:00,060
me off yet but well yeah so you're not

1070
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:01,079
again it's not a perfect security

1071
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:02,609
solution you're not actually blocking

1072
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:05,190
people from going there if they get the

1073
00:45:02,609 --> 00:45:07,500
IP address but you're stopping 90% of

1074
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:09,450
people who would go there because they

1075
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:10,589
can't get the IP address they know the

1076
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:13,049
name of the site which I'm not going to

1077
00:45:10,589 --> 00:45:14,670
say that they want to go to and then

1078
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:19,589
stop because they can't they can't

1079
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:21,599
resolve it free solution right it's not

1080
00:45:19,589 --> 00:45:24,529
technically a web proxy but you've made

1081
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:27,569
your network a lot safer ransomware

1082
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:30,410
there's at least one company cyber

1083
00:45:27,569 --> 00:45:33,240
reason offering a free ransomware tool

1084
00:45:30,410 --> 00:45:36,810
you can actively protect your machines

1085
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:38,819
from ransomware now obviously we're

1086
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:41,549
security people we don't trust people

1087
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:44,849
right so having cyber reason land free

1088
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:49,980
software on my end point it's dicey

1089
00:45:44,849 --> 00:45:52,140
situation but it's a low risk compared

1090
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:53,550
to if you know you've got users who are

1091
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:55,109
definitely going to click on those links

1092
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:56,609
and definitely going to download the

1093
00:45:55,109 --> 00:45:57,839
stuff and run the stuff and encrypt your

1094
00:45:56,609 --> 00:45:59,490
sort your hard drive and they've already

1095
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:01,230
done it three times and it went over to

1096
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:03,209
the file share and you you know if this

1097
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:04,980
happens maybe it's time to look at

1098
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:06,510
something like that and extend here your

1099
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:09,390
level of trust a little there are free

1100
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:10,860
solutions obviously a full antivirus or

1101
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:13,609
a full-blown solution is better

1102
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:16,890
but there are three ways to handle that

1103
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:21,030
I'm getting short on time right okay I

1104
00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:23,400
got two minutes okay we'll do this one

1105
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:25,920
quickly there's a last one so asset

1106
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:28,560
protection free asset protection prey

1107
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,540
project install it on your machine it's

1108
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:33,390
called the prey project it's a script

1109
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:35,580
that will run that will check if your

1110
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:36,810
machine has if you've told the Central

1111
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:38,100
Command that your machine is stolen and

1112
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:41,130
if it is then it's does telling you hey

1113
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:42,450
I'm here obviously if the attacker wipes

1114
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:45,630
the machine doesn't protect that but I

1115
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:49,109
can tell you from actual live experience

1116
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:51,510
that there are attackers I know at least

1117
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:55,020
two examples where they took the machine

1118
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:59,120
and took it to their house and turned it

1119
00:46:55,020 --> 00:47:04,340
on and put it on the network yeah smart

1120
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:07,080
one got caught detectives caught him but

1121
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:08,580
so prey project blew there our vendor

1122
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:10,259
solutions you can buy two particular

1123
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:14,850
assets but pre-project works really well

1124
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:16,860
and it's free policy is a dicey one you

1125
00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:18,630
can write your own security policy if

1126
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:19,800
your security professional you're better

1127
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:23,790
off letting security positive you know

1128
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:26,070
so what you're looking for it's a little

1129
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:28,529
bit dicey if in a small company in this

1130
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:30,060
room you can pick and choose and write

1131
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:32,160
your own policy and make it happen it'll

1132
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:34,250
be enough for a small company because

1133
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:37,140
again you're looking at the CIS top

1134
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:40,980
three maybe not even the whole twenty

1135
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:44,759
just a tiny company spam prevention ask

1136
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:46,320
your ISP about fixing about making sure

1137
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:50,340
that they're doing as much limiting as

1138
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:52,320
possible on your mail passwords

1139
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:54,720
obviously want a full program but you

1140
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:58,320
can go to the server and say we require

1141
00:47:54,720 --> 00:48:00,359
complex passwords you can do it free on

1142
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:03,120
your own and network segmentation start

1143
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:04,680
with subnetting yes network segmentation

1144
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:07,170
with firewalls is really awesome and

1145
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:08,490
it's a really great way to go and I love

1146
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:10,830
the way I feel nice and warm and cozy

1147
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:12,060
behind all my firewalls but if you can't

1148
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:13,799
afford all these firewalls at least

1149
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:15,090
segment the network you'll stop some of

1150
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:17,010
the broadcast traffic that some of the

1151
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:20,600
viruses are using

1152
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:22,560
so skipping through to the end yes so

1153
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:25,230
remember that your company is going to

1154
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:26,430
try to grow the company maybe small

1155
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:30,359
medium or large but you're going to try

1156
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:33,029
to grow be sure that the solutions that

1157
00:48:30,359 --> 00:48:35,520
you spend all this time on are going to

1158
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:37,920
be working in six months remember you've

1159
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:40,740
got to handle today but in six months

1160
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:43,980
you've got to be ready a year and so

1161
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:47,279
forth you don't want to be straight face

1162
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:50,550
you want to be like this guy who spent

1163
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:53,730
all this time and effort on his solution

1164
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:58,080
and set out six months later you

1165
00:48:53,730 --> 00:49:01,050
couldn't fit into his own suit hey still

1166
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:03,779
pretty cool all right you want you want

1167
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:06,030
to be sure that what you've got will

1168
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:08,840
work for now and will work when it's

1169
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:19,740
finally implemented so think ahead and

1170
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:24,720
we've got four minutes for questions no

1171
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:28,640
questions awesome yes slides will be

1172
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:31,350
online we'll give it a D sides right

1173
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:35,339
yeah what was the other thing you said

1174
00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:37,350
oh the product list yeah for the list of

1175
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:40,020
that I went down with all the products

1176
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:42,630
that will be also provided via live link

1177
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:49,200
in the slides those will go up or they

1178
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:52,010
can everyone can attack me yet good they

1179
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:55,980
want to record your voice forever

1180
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:59,660
you mentioned the USB drive swap back

1181
00:49:55,980 --> 00:50:03,119
and forth as a low-cost backup option

1182
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:06,180
definitely done that I I think if you

1183
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:08,640
have a small or even a small to medium

1184
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:10,259
size company here you started relatively

1185
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,700
recently you don't have much local

1186
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:14,340
infrastructure you don't have much local

1187
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:17,850
data is there is there a comparable

1188
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:20,220
low-cost backup solution for when you're

1189
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:24,480
using Google Apps or you're using office

1190
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:25,589
365 or is that really no it's not there

1191
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:28,500
yet good luck

1192
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:29,940
I have very mixed feelings about a lot

1193
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:32,250
of that stuff because running stuff in

1194
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:35,810
the cloud is great for some stuff but

1195
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:38,130
not for other stuff and and and so I

1196
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:40,170
sort of draw lines there and stuff that

1197
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:42,660
I really care about not getting out I

1198
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:47,000
would never put up there but to answer

1199
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:51,690
your question you can export from there

1200
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:53,940
onto a USB Drive just pull the data down

1201
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:55,950
now I talked with one customer there

1202
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:58,230
quite a bit about this and I finally

1203
00:50:55,950 --> 00:51:00,240
explained to them look if something

1204
00:50:58,230 --> 00:51:03,300
happens to your license agreement with

1205
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:06,330
Amazon and suddenly you can't get in is

1206
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:07,830
your company out of business if they

1207
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:11,009
decide you haven't paid your bill you're

1208
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:12,630
done is all of your data now there and

1209
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:14,550
you can't get to it oh wait there's a

1210
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:16,230
clause in the contract that says within

1211
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:18,030
like six months you have the right to do

1212
00:51:16,230 --> 00:51:19,290
a special download as yeah okay I need

1213
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:23,720
it today I want to get the company going

1214
00:51:19,290 --> 00:51:26,610
right so if you've downloaded your data

1215
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:27,540
then you've got a way out it does hit

1216
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:30,600
your bandwidth oh I don't have a way

1217
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:31,910
around that does that answer your

1218
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:44,400
question

1219
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:45,480
okay I'll just stop come on launch codes

1220
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,620
I'm going to keep it on an internal

1221
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:54,150
server that I secure with my own

1222
00:51:46,620 --> 00:52:01,290
firewalls on my own you know area then

1223
00:51:54,150 --> 00:52:02,700
you're running it in the cloud yep yet

1224
00:52:01,290 --> 00:52:04,650
mail like mail I put in the cloud mail

1225
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:06,899
is easy I was going by SMTP in the clear

1226
00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:10,410
anyway so I'm sending anything valuable

1227
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:11,580
in mail I'm screwed but yeah a lot of

1228
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:15,170
stuff runs in the cloud and then some

1229
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:15,170
stuff is just not local you're right oh

1230
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,030
yeah we are
