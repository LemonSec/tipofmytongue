1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,659
so this number is hopping we this region

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:05,520
here I taught me to talk about in order

3
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:07,859
for an attacker to steal from you any

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
person access this means ensuring that

5
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:12,300
their Sirica to is reliable to

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,910
resilience takedown that's the main

7
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,289
reason why we're 90 percent of our units

8
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,109
for command and control and exfiltration

9
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:20,400
the good news is that this percentage is

10
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:22,710
something we can use against the

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,640
attackers in order to find her accesses

12
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:28,980
and how we respond the dispossession

13
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,840
Todd will explain a new approach that

14
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,059
goes beyond simply walking and dropping

15
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,620
malware see two attendees we learn how

16
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:36,589
to speak malware in order to better

17
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:39,660
respond when an attacker targets them

18
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:54,750
and we'll be doing a Q&A after any

19
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:57,120
questions whether I'm Todd thanks I'm

20
00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:01,350
from st. Louis and last year we held our

21
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,149
first b-sides and the the number of

22
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,439
people in this room was bigger than all

23
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:07,770
of the people that showed up to our

24
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:11,100
b-sides so it's it's really great to be

25
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:13,229
here last year about 50% of our

26
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:17,908
attendees and besides st. Louis were

27
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:21,840
students so how many in the room are our

28
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:24,000
students now Oh awesome okay you guys

29
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,150
are all camouflage that's great welcome

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,299
I so one of the things I wanted to start

31
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:33,509
off with is I've been in security for

32
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:36,000
twenty years and if you want to talk

33
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:37,320
about different paths and security you

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,670
know and you're going to hear some

35
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,189
stories about some fun things that I've

36
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,890
done in 20 years I'd love to talk about

37
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:47,039
that stuff so please find me after the

38
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,810
talk at the happy hour tonight and you

39
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,979
know I'd love to talk about that with

40
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:55,860
you um so I'm going to talk about it's

41
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:56,909
it's more of an idea piece right I'm not

42
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,250
going to hand you a piece of technology

43
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:00,509
at the end of the talk or send you to a

44
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,210
github where you can download our

45
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:06,990
software I'm going to work on some ideas

46
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:10,199
with you and I'm going to need your

47
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:13,590
brains participation throughout the

48
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:17,730
whole talk so I'm Todd I'm one of the

49
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:19,650
founders and CTO at at strong-arm we are

50
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:22,079
headquartered in the Boston area which

51
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:25,739
is how I ended up here so we're up in

52
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:30,720
Wakefield and the reason we are up in

53
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:33,569
Wakefield is so I was a I was a Purdue

54
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,720
guy and I studied at serious gene

55
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:38,548
Stafford's Research Center and my story

56
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,080
on how I came into security was I was

57
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:44,299
walking by a lecture hall like this and

58
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:50,190
somebody was talking about Kerberos

59
00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:52,079
inside inside the room and so I just

60
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:54,239
kind of wandered in because you know it

61
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:56,549
sounded interesting it was a cool name

62
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,470
and the cool thing actually Kerberos is

63
00:02:56,549 --> 00:03:01,170
a really interesting protocol and so I

64
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:02,849
wandered in and these grad students had

65
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:04,140
figured out a weakness in ticket

66
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:07,470
granting and in the ticket granting

67
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:10,170
ticket process which is like that's

68
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,790
that's the holy grail of of Kerberos if

69
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:17,780
you can if you can get tickets you win

70
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:19,798
and at that point I was hooked so I

71
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:22,700
listened to the talk I was just

72
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:27,560
enthralled I really got into crypto and

73
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:30,238
the system side of security and then uh

74
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,040
my goal in life was to go to NSA and be

75
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,650
a Code Breaker but that didn't work out

76
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,108
for for a variety of reasons and so I

77
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:42,660
ended up at mitre which is headquartered

78
00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:44,849
in Bedford Massachusetts at mitre I my

79
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:47,370
first job was writing forensics tools

80
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:50,459
for the Defense Department what was what

81
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:54,209
is now the defense cybercrime Center was

82
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:57,150
the forensic Center back then and I did

83
00:03:54,209 --> 00:04:00,329
15 plus years of active Incident

84
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:02,730
Response at one point I was on the other

85
00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:07,829
end of a connection with with bad people

86
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:09,959
and so I split my time between

87
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:13,500
real-world incident response stuff and

88
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:14,639
doing research and I'm going to talk to

89
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,339
you about some of the research we've

90
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:19,620
done today and what we've turned into a

91
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:21,988
product so I left mitre two-and-a-half

92
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,830
years ago and started a company called

93
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:26,820
strongarm

94
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:27,539
and that's the the mitre is mitre in

95
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:32,730
Bedford is our

96
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:34,950
connection to to Wakefield so I I'm an

97
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:38,520
Irishman life I'll tell stories the

98
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:43,140
whole time I won't really refer much to

99
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:46,830
to the slides so I was working on a team

100
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:51,450
doing incident response and we had in a

101
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:54,060
set of analysts brilliant people and I

102
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:56,400
was their tool builder type so I was

103
00:04:54,060 --> 00:05:00,110
q-branch for these for these individuals

104
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:05,130
and we built custom tools to track

105
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:07,490
persistent and highly capable attackers

106
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:14,150
they were

107
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:16,800
well-funded so the one day we found that

108
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:19,109
someone not good was accessing an

109
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,080
unsecured web app that we had had been

110
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:24,210
running and this was like 2003 2004 so

111
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,550
you know web apps without user IDs and

112
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:29,310
passwords that it wasn't an uncommon

113
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:32,510
thing and it turns out that this web app

114
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:37,260
stored some pretty sensitive information

115
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:40,140
so what we did our response to that was

116
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:42,599
I I'll go from left to right on the

117
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:45,210
slide so what the attacker did is on on

118
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:48,540
your left and what we did is on the

119
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:52,140
right so um one of the crazy things we

120
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:56,430
did back then was put filtering on what

121
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:58,830
domains could talk to the web server so

122
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:02,310
we think that it took the attacker about

123
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:04,680
a week to circumvent that they simply

124
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:06,300
proxied through the trusted domain they

125
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:12,120
figured out what it was and went through

126
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:14,880
the trusted name and at that point they

127
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:17,010
were a week later six months later we

128
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,130
found them so that's the time frame

129
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:22,500
where we're working out here and so

130
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:24,270
we're going to get them we're going to

131
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:28,010
make people get user IDs and passwords

132
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:31,620
for this system and so that took us

133
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:36,200
about three months worth of effort a few

134
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:40,950
hundred people hours to implement that

135
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:41,400
and the attackers simply found a way to

136
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,990
route

137
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:46,049
around the process they found a weakness

138
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:48,630
that we didn't know of in in how

139
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:52,289
passwords were reset you simply had to

140
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:54,780
have an email with a specific extension

141
00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:58,280
on it and the password reset process

142
00:06:54,780 --> 00:07:01,380
would say here's a new password and so

143
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:03,330
you know it took us however um you know

144
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:05,940
six three to six months to implement

145
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:07,830
that and you know the attacker tried

146
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:11,130
some stuff and they were back in within

147
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:12,719
two weeks again a year later we found

148
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:14,550
them back in the system so we've got

149
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,240
gaps in visibility

150
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:20,490
we've got asymmetry right so the

151
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:24,690
attackers are are spending a week and

152
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:26,940
we're spending months and so eventually

153
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:30,810
we hardened to this past this the the

154
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:32,789
process of reset your passwords and at

155
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:34,860
that point the attacker simply social

156
00:07:32,789 --> 00:07:37,560
engineered their way around it and the

157
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:41,340
stuff they did was choice it was really

158
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:44,070
nice work and you know at that point

159
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:47,880
where we've got to do something big and

160
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:49,740
so we implemented smart cards and the

161
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:53,969
cost for this program was staggering

162
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:56,160
staggering and the pain that it caused

163
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:58,229
people you know this two-factor

164
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,120
authentication thing was it was it

165
00:07:58,229 --> 00:08:02,130
wasn't like Bank of America made you do

166
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,620
it back then it was really painful to do

167
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:08,580
users hate it security people are

168
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:12,889
working you know we we had we put a lot

169
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:16,020
of time and money into this program and

170
00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:18,449
the attacker simply moved over to softer

171
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:21,948
targets so one hundred million dollar

172
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:24,419
expenditure you know hand-wavy a

173
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:26,760
hand-wavy estimate on the attacker

174
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:29,849
simply moved away from where we had

175
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:31,440
protected over to a softer target all

176
00:08:29,849 --> 00:08:33,689
they had to do is recalibrate themselves

177
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,490
and you know they probably took them a

178
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:36,900
couple of weeks to you know make some

179
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:39,180
decisions on how to do that and then go

180
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:40,770
target some softer some softer targets

181
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:44,010
so one hundred million dollar

182
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:49,199
expenditure and a couple of weeks on the

183
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:53,069
attacker part so this at this point you

184
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:55,470
know we we're starting to

185
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:59,630
get some questions from from the

186
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:59,630
leadership sorry

187
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:06,949
there goes and my punchline my whole

188
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:09,480
punch line right so if you do the math

189
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:11,820
the defenders aren't going to win ever

190
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,330
if getting in fact the chasm is getting

191
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:15,260
worse

192
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:17,580
and so you know we've got we've got

193
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:18,720
working military so there's generals on

194
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,180
the other end of the table and they're

195
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,150
asking us well it looks like all these

196
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:27,390
technical things that you're doing that

197
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:29,100
they're not buying us anything and by

198
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:31,350
this time we we knew who the attacker

199
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,510
was we had some ID you know some some

200
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:36,810
idea of what they were after

201
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:38,610
we we had an understanding of their

202
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:43,640
level of sophistication simply from

203
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:46,620
engaging them for seven years and and so

204
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:51,150
we thought through like there's got to

205
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:52,680
be a better way so I'd urge you I'm sure

206
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:57,510
there are plenty of people who who are

207
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:59,040
in security is your approach how are you

208
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:01,439
dealing with this asymmetry in your

209
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:07,199
security programs you know just think

210
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:08,580
about that and so uh on the other end of

211
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,980
the table I didn't I didn't have a good

212
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:13,140
answer and that stuff really bothers me

213
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:16,290
when when I don't have any any

214
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:18,330
perspective on a problem so um let's do

215
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:25,199
some research and that's exactly what we

216
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:26,970
did so show hands who here is familiar

217
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,380
with the cyber kill chain from Lockheed

218
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:32,220
Martin okay great

219
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:35,790
so I I'm I'm going to have to explain

220
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:37,800
the model for the rest of the audience

221
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:39,300
so please bear with me but and I'm going

222
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,359
to show you a nuance but I think you'll

223
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:44,880
really like maybe you already know so

224
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:47,490
the cyber kill chain is a is a model for

225
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:50,280
how attackers go after a target and it

226
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:52,980
starts with with just that a target so

227
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,360
an attacker is given a reason to break

228
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:57,390
into something they don't

229
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:59,940
indiscriminately do it and in this case

230
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:02,069
it was intellectual property you may

231
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:03,870
work in a intellectual property rich

232
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:06,570
environment um so you may be targeted

233
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,990
for that as well other things that we've

234
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:09,720
seen

235
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:12,270
are if you work in a highly competitive

236
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:15,420
industry your competitors can hire

237
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:16,500
people with less scruples to go break

238
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,540
into your network and steal your

239
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:22,020
customers from you that's one thing

240
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:24,329
we've seen and of course the theft of

241
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:26,430
money is everywhere and ransomware

242
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:27,750
stealing credit cards stealing a

243
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:29,459
personal information selling it on the

244
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:32,820
black market model model wah so they

245
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:36,930
have a target at that point they decide

246
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:40,910
to go after a set of those targets so

247
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:43,859
they they begin to build typically

248
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:50,130
phishing emails that look very very

249
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:52,550
realistic and at that point they will

250
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:55,620
package up something that goes boom and

251
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:57,510
exploit no link to something to try and

252
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,800
get you to take an action those kinds of

253
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:01,560
things

254
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:06,170
so then installation step exploitation

255
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:08,459
step 4 that's when when the boom happens

256
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:10,410
installation of their initial package

257
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:14,340
and then then they start to embed

258
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:20,760
themselves like a tank and so you know

259
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:25,260
your your victim is now talking to them

260
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:27,600
and the bad you know the the attacker

261
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:29,160
um can now start to take action on on

262
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,920
what their whatever they're targeting

263
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:34,980
the intellectual property or your

264
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,959
customer database or money and so on

265
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:39,150
what what I think is cool and what might

266
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:41,100
be nuanced or something some you that

267
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:44,579
understand the kill chain is this

268
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:46,860
timeline column and this is what we paid

269
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:50,250
most attention to so at this point we

270
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:53,070
were spending all of our time in here

271
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:54,690
and if you think about it most security

272
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:57,150
tools spend their time in here they're

273
00:12:54,690 --> 00:13:00,420
trying to watch for this boom but it

274
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:02,720
happens in a matter of seconds so if you

275
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:06,000
don't get it the first time you lose

276
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,310
then any attacker parks and they start

277
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,810
to you know just get comfortable might

278
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:11,670
move laterally I'm going to move over

279
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:15,420
here Park my support some new malware

280
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:17,550
over there begin to look like an

281
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,439
administrator that's a classic classic

282
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:20,959
technique so they start to get domain

283
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,129
credentials and then

284
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,410
they become part of your system

285
00:13:22,129 --> 00:13:25,550
administration team and and all kinds of

286
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:27,680
other fun stuff like that and then they

287
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:32,269
start sending emails as you and and then

288
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:36,969
things really get fun but very few

289
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:39,920
people spend any time working here and

290
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:42,199
we got all the time in the world months

291
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,420
and back then it was over a year and

292
00:13:42,199 --> 00:13:47,479
I've seen 12 times in the three-year

293
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:50,089
mark so attackers who had access to a

294
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:53,720
network for three years before they got

295
00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:56,569
caught so we got all kinds of time in

296
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:59,980
the world to work on this so let's let's

297
00:13:56,569 --> 00:14:03,290
do that and that's what we did

298
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:06,800
so another sorry for the established

299
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:07,969
security people in the audience but this

300
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,719
is what malware command and control

301
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:14,059
looks like in essence in general it

302
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:16,790
always starts with the victim and the

303
00:14:14,059 --> 00:14:19,540
victim says I am here I have broken in

304
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:21,949
I'm I've landed on Todd's laptop and

305
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:24,618
Todd is part of this workgroup and

306
00:14:21,949 --> 00:14:27,469
here's the you know here's where the the

307
00:14:24,619 --> 00:14:30,379
malware is loaded what version of the

308
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:32,600
operating system what network shares are

309
00:14:30,379 --> 00:14:34,399
attached those kinds of things and then

310
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,679
the attacker gets to say something back

311
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,929
and so normally what this is what we

312
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:41,089
call a smash-and-grab operation so they

313
00:14:38,929 --> 00:14:44,149
a get in and then they'll take

314
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:45,860
everything that was on on this this

315
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:48,470
particular system just to figure out

316
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:51,740
where they landed and in a in a highly

317
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:53,209
sophisticated operation they'll hand

318
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:55,100
that off to an analysis team and the

319
00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:57,290
analysis team will pick through what

320
00:14:55,100 --> 00:15:00,920
they've got access to and say I want

321
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:04,490
more of that and so I'm a big music nerd

322
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:06,709
and so you know they're there maybe that

323
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:11,839
our target is a drum machine from the

324
00:15:06,709 --> 00:15:15,768
80s and so they the attacker then

325
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:19,369
searches for these terms the adsr

326
00:15:15,769 --> 00:15:21,889
envelope and the malware responds back

327
00:15:19,369 --> 00:15:24,529
with I found a document that matches

328
00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:29,089
what you want and the attacker says okay

329
00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:31,670
give me that please and then they know

330
00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:34,730
the documents come down and then at that

331
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:36,769
point they kind of settle in they know

332
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:38,959
they are may do a little bit of lateral

333
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:40,820
movement to establish themselves further

334
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:46,660
in the network and and those kinds of

335
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:46,660
things and so I'm gonna take a drink

336
00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:56,000
unfortunately what we were what we would

337
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,410
see and I was I was mostly a network guy

338
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,720
I did a lot of work in IDS's and

339
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:05,089
firewalls and what this looks like - an

340
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:07,699
idea this and so I'm sitting at the

341
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:09,860
other end of the table and I have to

342
00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:13,040
answer okay who is it

343
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:17,060
what have they taken and where are they

344
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:20,719
and this don't tell me that I can say

345
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:23,268
they're there if I'm lucky I'll know

346
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,370
that they've gotten you know like domain

347
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:31,010
credential and then I could say well

348
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:36,070
they took everything that's that's about

349
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:36,069
the best I can do and so what we did

350
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:50,209
well maybe we can hack malware so we did

351
00:16:44,209 --> 00:16:53,660
and it was it was a blast and so what we

352
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:56,589
did was we we did a man in though I'm

353
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:59,719
sure you guys are all familiar with

354
00:16:56,589 --> 00:17:00,079
breaking SSL and doing SSL man in the

355
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,610
middle

356
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,769
I have philosophies on that that I like

357
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:05,990
to debate so if you'd like to argue with

358
00:17:03,769 --> 00:17:08,120
me afterwards please

359
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:12,250
so but what we did was built a

360
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:15,109
man-in-the-middle for the malware and so

361
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:18,109
we would use indicators compromise you

362
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:20,030
know figure out our specialty was there

363
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:21,559
for going out where their servers were

364
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:24,410
their command and control servers and

365
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:26,660
then what we see here is hey I'm on

366
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:28,910
Todd's computer and we intercept this

367
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:30,770
and we can apply a policy here so not

368
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:34,790
only do we get to see it we get to

369
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:36,889
control what they're doing and in most

370
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:40,010
cases yeah that's that's that's okay you

371
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:42,200
can report that out and so the attacker

372
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:44,120
would then begin to try to download

373
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,530
everything and we could give them back

374
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:48,889
we could give them back what they asked

375
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:51,379
for we could also give them back

376
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:54,470
an error which is most commonly what

377
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:56,030
risk-averse people do we can put things

378
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:59,960
in this channel I'll talk to you about

379
00:17:56,030 --> 00:18:03,020
that a little bit and so so on and so

380
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:06,560
forth and and this disability really

381
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:11,540
allowed us to go from let's see if this

382
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:14,750
works from this in order to from from

383
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:16,280
this kind of a picture and now if I'm

384
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:18,350
sitting at the end of the table I can

385
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:21,430
say well we know that they were

386
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:24,080
targeting this kind of information and

387
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:27,590
they wanted to download these kinds of

388
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:29,179
files and there's also some technical

389
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:31,040
information that you can see inside the

390
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:34,190
malware um that helps you do poor man's

391
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:38,120
attribution and so there's a lot of you

392
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:40,820
know goodness here um but it was all

393
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:44,389
technical stuff right we really didn't

394
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:47,300
get any closer to the to the to the

395
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:52,700
human side of understanding really why

396
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:54,139
and giving any other options for

397
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,670
protection right we found the malware

398
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:58,160
that's good we're going to reduce

399
00:18:55,670 --> 00:19:00,560
12-time but that's not that's not really

400
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,840
interesting stuff for us you know an

401
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,429
executive who's just been been attacked

402
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:07,629
and you know maybe they're they're all

403
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:10,940
their customer data was stolen so um

404
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:12,560
maybe maybe we can hack the attackers

405
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:14,060
themselves and I'm not talking about

406
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:16,129
getting on the keyboard and going and

407
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:21,350
blowing up their stuff on there and like

408
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:23,770
let's get into their brain and so does

409
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:26,090
anybody know about the farewell dossier

410
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:29,570
anyone okay this is going to be great

411
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:32,480
you'll love it so we hooked up with some

412
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:34,460
social scientists and they were social

413
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,040
scientists in the in the in the purest

414
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:39,170
form they knew very little technical

415
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:43,399
stuff which is kind of how we wanted it

416
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:47,390
and they introduced us to this to this

417
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:50,720
wonderful story so farewell was the name

418
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:55,570
of a Soviet defector in the 80s and the

419
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:59,120
French named named him and at one point

420
00:19:55,570 --> 00:20:02,010
as the defection was happening the

421
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:05,780
French premier came to President Reagan

422
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:10,890
said we have a Soviet defector and

423
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:14,540
they've told us all about the Soviets

424
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:17,280
troubles building pipelines in Siberia

425
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:18,270
they there have it they found oil but

426
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,690
they don't know how to move it

427
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:25,320
the Canadians with us we know how to

428
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:29,130
move it so the Soviets had implanted a

429
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:30,480
bunch of KGB agents into this company

430
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:32,460
that was building and operating

431
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:36,030
pipelines in Canada in order to steal

432
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:42,120
from him and so the CIA took her on a

433
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:44,879
plane went to Ottawa and told man I know

434
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:48,719
the the Canadian equivalent of the the

435
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:53,130
CIA national security so the Canadian

436
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:55,260
equivalent of the CIA and you know their

437
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:57,090
first response was okay well we got all

438
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:59,460
the names here let's go round him up and

439
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:04,679
they said no no no no no no no we want

440
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:07,380
you to give them this and so the you

441
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,760
know the the Canadians placed all these

442
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,320
documents some throughout this

443
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:15,420
organization they're all paper documents

444
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:18,240
this is the 80s and the the Soviets took

445
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:20,370
them back to Moscow and about a year

446
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:24,420
later there was a catastrophic failure

447
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:28,169
in the pipeline and you know so you

448
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:31,260
might you might count that as a win but

449
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:36,570
the ultimate win even even more even

450
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:38,700
more so than that was the the KGB began

451
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:41,610
to distrust the information that they

452
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:44,220
had stolen from the West and that is

453
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:48,000
more powerful than then you know any

454
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:51,570
anything and so they they they started

455
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,300
the purge um and revalidate and do you

456
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:58,350
know and revalidate everything that they

457
00:21:54,300 --> 00:22:00,180
stolen and so if you work in an

458
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:01,980
intellectual property heavy environment

459
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:03,960
you know think about that as a

460
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:07,440
protection mechanism for yourselves

461
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:11,280
because I will tell you based on

462
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,740
experience the the attackers aren't

463
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,320
going to stop you have something they

464
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:17,600
want and they're going to come see

465
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:20,149
from you one way or another be it via a

466
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,439
computer or implanting a spy in your

467
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:23,090
organization they're going to figure out

468
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,710
a way to to come after you

469
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:29,060
so you'd have to come up with some

470
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:34,960
clever ways to to respond and so we did

471
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:37,820
a bunch of research on this and so it's

472
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:41,120
what we did this is an experiment I

473
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:43,429
don't suggest you go run out and do this

474
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:47,239
on your networks today I'm trying to

475
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:49,610
implant some ideas in your head and so

476
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,610
what we did was pitted a red team

477
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:54,439
against the blue team the red team's job

478
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:56,419
was to have an understanding of the

479
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,820
Blues plans basically to predict what

480
00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:01,220
what the blue team was going to do and

481
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:03,679
I'm not talking about like a computer

482
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:07,040
blue team here these were military

483
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:09,040
operations in this case and blues job

484
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:12,170
wasn't to protect the computer network

485
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:14,750
it was to ensure the success of the

486
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:16,430
mission they had a job to do and it was

487
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:19,960
it was part of their job to ensure that

488
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:23,720
things that their mission was successful

489
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:25,850
through an understanding of where the

490
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,860
attackers had come in to things like

491
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:31,879
email boxes you know computers that

492
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:35,320
could steal information the red team was

493
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:40,610
fed a study stream of both true and

494
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:43,550
misinformation um and uh you know

495
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:47,209
ultimately the the were fully tricked

496
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:49,879
into the story that they were that they

497
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:53,180
were fed there is an awesome talk by the

498
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:55,790
mitre people that they are Co

499
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:58,370
researchers on this wrote a book and

500
00:23:55,790 --> 00:24:01,460
have given talks throughout the country

501
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:03,979
public talks on this and let me know if

502
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:07,340
you want URLs and whatnot and all I'll

503
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:10,400
supply those and so one of my favorite

504
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:13,280
parts of this of doing the experiment

505
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,560
was we had the social scientists with us

506
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:17,830
and they they were deception experts

507
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:22,490
that's that's what their background was

508
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:25,669
and I can remember the first time we

509
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:27,440
started talking about all of the access

510
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:28,940
points that an attacker has on an

511
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,820
organization

512
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:33,290
and when I told them that if they put

513
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:35,270
something in an email box this

514
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:36,530
particular email box because we found

515
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:38,720
out the account the account was

516
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:40,490
compromised that the attacker would get

517
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,530
it and they would know that the attacker

518
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:45,350
would get it so like their eyes lit up

519
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:49,340
and they started building these kinds of

520
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:51,230
things into the plan and these were the

521
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:53,510
engagement points that we identified and

522
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:55,250
use throughout the experiment email

523
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:59,110
boxes are awesome if you find a popped

524
00:24:55,250 --> 00:25:02,920
email account it's a real opportunity to

525
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:02,919
to give something back

526
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:11,889
documents that are on on shared drives

527
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:14,770
and that are on people's laptops as well

528
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:19,430
there was a couple of instances of

529
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:21,280
giving giving back there and then we

530
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:23,270
actually had a totally failed experiment

531
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:26,750
maybe I'll talk about that if I have a

532
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:28,190
little extra time on web apps but web

533
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:31,730
apps are also a real nice opportunity

534
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:34,040
when you find a pop account to let them

535
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:37,220
use the account for a little while so

536
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:38,899
that you can figure out what they're

537
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:40,550
after and where they're coming from

538
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:46,520
because it's another thing that you get

539
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:51,700
to see and so by combining being able to

540
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:54,020
give access to information by by giving

541
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:58,480
information back to the attackers that

542
00:25:54,020 --> 00:26:07,480
was well formulated by the blue team the

543
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:11,140
the research was a was a big success so

544
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:15,070
I'll talk to you about one last thing

545
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:17,120
maybe we can hack our own organizations

546
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:20,810
kind of sticking with this theme of

547
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:23,120
getting into people's heads and again

548
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:24,919
I'm not talking about like breaking into

549
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,479
your own people's like pen testing and

550
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:29,270
those kinds of things

551
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,610
so ninety still to this day I think this

552
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:36,020
number is true 90% of attacks start with

553
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:37,490
a fish despite new approaches coming out

554
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:40,010
this is tried and true

555
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:42,860
so the bianco to the top of the pyramid

556
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:45,170
of pain this is their TTP

557
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:47,209
fishing is a TTP and if you can get out

558
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:53,240
ahead of it you you're going to do

559
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:56,809
better so let's work on this I have a

560
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:58,400
technical degree for for better or for

561
00:26:56,809 --> 00:27:01,428
worse right it served me well in some

562
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:03,590
regards and very poorly in others and I

563
00:27:01,429 --> 00:27:07,970
this this whole user education thing

564
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:12,879
talking to your users about fishes was I

565
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:12,880
blew it off when when I was a pup and

566
00:27:13,059 --> 00:27:16,928
you know that's that's actual statement

567
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:19,219
for me there is no way that will work

568
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:25,240
well it turns out was really really

569
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:27,740
wrong talking to users about phishing

570
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:31,490
really works like getting into their

571
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:34,580
heads and another fun story to share

572
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:40,240
here on this one so start with the

573
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:44,928
executives and there's a reason for that

574
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:47,299
so we had a bunch of I think it's called

575
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:51,260
whale session wailing wailing that's

576
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:52,570
what it's not good with my lingo so we

577
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:59,840
had a bunch of executives get targeted

578
00:27:52,570 --> 00:28:01,700
and one of them clicked and so we went

579
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,780
to have a conversation with them and it

580
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:05,410
turns out that they weren't the only

581
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:08,120
ones targeted but that conversation

582
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:10,669
turned into a conversation not between

583
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:12,199
us security people and the executive the

584
00:28:10,669 --> 00:28:16,669
executives started talking amongst

585
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:19,280
themselves they they started comparing

586
00:28:16,669 --> 00:28:22,970
notes hey I got this kind of a message

587
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:26,928
last week and I found it I told the

588
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:29,840
security people the but the kicker the

589
00:28:26,929 --> 00:28:33,950
best of all my absolute favorite is they

590
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:35,990
began comparing accounting like this is

591
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:38,150
an executive in charge of plans or

592
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:41,179
logistics or operations these aren't

593
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:43,850
aren't security people but they they

594
00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:46,880
built it into their into their daily

595
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:49,459
routine weekly routine to understand how

596
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,800
their organization has been targeted by

597
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:54,740
fishing and then they compared it with

598
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:56,149
the other executives so my programs got

599
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:58,760
fished five times

600
00:28:56,150 --> 00:29:01,760
how many times did your programs get

601
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:03,830
fished and it was by this attacker and

602
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:07,390
here's that here's the new thing that

603
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:10,310
they've added another another fun fact

604
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:12,410
public release on Monday it was using a

605
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:13,879
phishing attack on Tuesday right hey

606
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:16,130
look at this new press release from the

607
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:20,890
organization the PDF with a boom in the

608
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:24,110
middle and so um make a game out of it

609
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:26,270
get people talking to each other get

610
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:28,389
people on the staff not security people

611
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:33,050
talking to each other

612
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:36,320
reporting to you as security

613
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:37,639
practitioners um the the data that you

614
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,570
can get out of these phishing emails is

615
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,640
gold

616
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:41,870
get your be nice to your people don't

617
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,340
shame them when they get a phishing

618
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:45,320
email don't shame them when they click

619
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:48,830
please because that's that's Pavlovian

620
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:52,370
that's bad badness get them talking to

621
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:54,020
you about it build that rapport and get

622
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:57,320
everybody in the organization working

623
00:29:54,020 --> 00:30:08,450
together because I I have seen that work

624
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:12,110
and it's a it's really a win so this is

625
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:16,490
about the end of the structured talk

626
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:19,189
that I have my goal today was to implant

627
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:22,250
some ideas so if you guys have some fun

628
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:25,250
ideas that you'd like to share with the

629
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:28,360
audience on different ways you can get

630
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:31,310
in the heads of bad people good people

631
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:34,010
I'd love to have the conversation and I

632
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:39,649
can share one more story if if the if

633
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:39,980
the you guys don't want to talk I can do

634
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:45,940
that

635
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:48,320
yes yes please so my name is Darwin

636
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:50,120
president of the cybersecurity Club at

637
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:53,629
savvy Regina University in Newport Rhode

638
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:56,360
Island and one one initiative that we

639
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:58,490
have is cyber hygiene a cyber hygiene

640
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:01,550
awareness campaign where we post a very

641
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:05,390
practical tips around campus graphically

642
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:07,190
please in but what we try to do is bring

643
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:07,840
the language down to everyday language

644
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:11,290
when it

645
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:13,050
so phishing passwords uh whatever it may

646
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:15,460
be what do you think it would get to

647
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:20,379
what do you think it would take to get

648
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:23,260
the conversation started on the student

649
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:25,540
level just for not only for people who

650
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:28,900
are seeking on cybersecurity knowledge

651
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:30,670
or tips but also like around the whole

652
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:34,210
entire campus in our first semester

653
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:35,800
we've we've gotten 68 members and it's a

654
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:37,390
pretty small liberal arts school where

655
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:39,550
we don't have a undergraduate

656
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:42,490
cybersecurity program so it's like I

657
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:43,870
feel like we're doing a lot but we could

658
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:46,570
do more because everybody is vulnerable

659
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:50,500
so yeah I was interested in seeing what

660
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:54,070
your take on it would be oh man I have a

661
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:56,260
couple of ideas so it has to be about

662
00:31:54,070 --> 00:32:00,550
making a connection with with whoever

663
00:31:56,260 --> 00:32:03,820
you're targeting if make it make it real

664
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:06,450
to them and so what one thing that's fun

665
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:09,100
is do you have a relationship with IT

666
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:11,440
like if people talk to you do people

667
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:13,889
talk to you or IT about the fishes that

668
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,890
they get

669
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:49,699
yeah so you got to get started somewhere

670
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:52,160
right you gotta have the spark and then

671
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:53,990
what happens once once you start to get

672
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:56,300
people to like you'll become the fishing

673
00:32:53,990 --> 00:33:01,070
guy right and people will start talking

674
00:32:56,300 --> 00:33:03,500
to you and you you know from the from

675
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:04,970
the assessment from the fishing

676
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:07,030
assessment you know you'll have some

677
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:09,950
stories of how many people clicked and

678
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:13,820
from that people start talking about hey

679
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:16,040
I got this brand new ups fishing email I

680
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:18,830
didn't click on it but my buddy over

681
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:20,540
there did and they they got there their

682
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:23,480
whole computer taken over by ransomware

683
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:26,720
and so you'll be able to relay those

684
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:28,640
those stories to everybody on campus and

685
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:32,750
you know at that point you can you can

686
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:35,210
pick and choose the the best one for the

687
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:36,680
person that you're talking to you know

688
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:39,260
if they're if they're are rampant

689
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:42,260
clicker there's that one set of stories

690
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:44,120
if they're you know the in this think

691
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:45,980
tank off sensibly you're you're building

692
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:47,870
cool stuff right that someone would want

693
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:50,350
to steal and so that's that's a

694
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:50,350
different story

695
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:57,610
Thank You uncle welcome to security oh

696
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:06,590
and I sorry I have another I have

697
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:09,710
another anecdote here um so the the the

698
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:10,790
simple down to earth there's a couple of

699
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:13,820
people I can refer you to

700
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:18,409
so the San Diego union-tribune

701
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:24,290
has begun a nationwide cybersecurity

702
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:27,440
publication that's targeted at laypeople

703
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:30,940
so people that don't work in security

704
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:33,409
and it's very down to earth very very

705
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:37,300
easy to read

706
00:34:33,409 --> 00:34:39,950
and then for a more a more sophisticated

707
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:42,830
read there's a guy named Michael Sant

708
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:44,270
Arcangelo who writes for CSO and he's

709
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:45,168
got a couple of other really great

710
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:47,929
programs on

711
00:34:45,168 --> 00:34:49,109
it's called security straight talk and

712
00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:51,600
it's it's just

713
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:53,580
about making connections and ensuring

714
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:55,940
that people understand the value of

715
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:58,170
security and everything that they do I

716
00:34:55,940 --> 00:35:00,150
think we got a we got a mic in the back

717
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:01,020
and then we'll go to the front like

718
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:03,630
hello

719
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:05,780
oh there hi my name is David Sloan I'm

720
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:09,000
an IT manager at a software company in

721
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:12,990
Somerville and we started doing phishing

722
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:15,960
tests last year and the thing that was

723
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:19,140
most successful for us was doing a super

724
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:20,490
unfair phishing test so it it looked a

725
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:24,029
little bit like it was from the director

726
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:25,620
of HR not exactly wrong email domain but

727
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:28,560
mostly looked like everything but it was

728
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:31,200
about company retreat that was coming up

729
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,759
that people were talking about a lot it

730
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,609
was it was supposed to be in Florida

731
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:38,820
people are really concerned about Zika

732
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:40,590
and it was super unfair like to make you

733
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:42,840
click on this thing percent fire man up

734
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:44,520
and bounce it was about well we got a

735
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:47,250
lot of people upset but people either

736
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:48,750
loved it or hated it and that was a

737
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:51,180
great thing people talked about this

738
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:53,100
thing for weeks and nobody had ever

739
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:55,259
talked about fishing before we do want

740
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:57,270
to talk about it it's boring who cares

741
00:35:55,260 --> 00:36:00,420
go do your thing fix it save it we don't

742
00:35:57,270 --> 00:36:02,600
want we have work to do but it engaging

743
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:05,100
people in this thing they cared about

744
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:07,259
really really really raised awareness

745
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:09,210
and so I definitely encourage you to do

746
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:10,530
the things that are unfair and be

747
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:12,090
willing to make a few people upset

748
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:14,460
definitely get by and where you need to

749
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:18,720
don't you know ruin your career anything

750
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:20,960
but but be a jerk a little bit and and

751
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:25,109
get people talking like you're saying

752
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:27,020
yeah so the I can't say it enough one of

753
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:29,310
the things that pisses me off more than

754
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:32,070
more than anything in security I'll

755
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:34,410
suffice to say it's user shaming drives

756
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:36,360
me nuts if I hear any of you doing it

757
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:39,450
I'm going to stop you and I will give

758
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:41,310
you a lecture don't do it it turns off

759
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:43,710
the people that you're trying to work

760
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:46,770
with do not make fun of them for

761
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:49,680
clicking on phishing emails these people

762
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:52,200
are victims they get chosen by an

763
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:54,450
attacker and if you think they're dumb

764
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:57,109
to click on a phishing email well your

765
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:57,109
day may come

766
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:05,750
phonier you mentioned your shim Layer

767
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:06,140
SSL inspection between the malware oh my

768
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:08,420
god oh

769
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:11,540
every try throwing a malicious Word

770
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:13,130
document back at them you're set univ

771
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:15,140
documents was your example download all

772
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:17,080
the documents why not throw a bad macro

773
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:20,480
in there somewhere

774
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:22,279
it's so sure you could do that right you

775
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:25,930
can put it you can put a PDF with a boom

776
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:29,120
in it but it's so uninteresting to me

777
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:30,259
and that's that maybe that was me uh you

778
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:33,140
can put anything you want in these

779
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:35,000
channels right and I'm not a lawyer so I

780
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:36,650
don't I don't think that you should go

781
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,200
put documents with exploits on your

782
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:41,930
shared Drive or anything like that but

783
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:44,689
for me it was I was trying to reach the

784
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:47,779
pinnacle of you know the the pyramid of

785
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:49,610
pain and and really understand how the

786
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:51,770
attackers were working against me and

787
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:54,470
what they were after on so that I could

788
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:56,660
build security programs as what we call

789
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:59,930
in the military and operational level so

790
00:37:56,660 --> 00:38:02,029
if I have a program that nation state

791
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:04,460
wants access to I'm going to put more

792
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:07,870
money into that program and less money

793
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:10,460
into you know the the picnics website

794
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:12,680
and that's really what I was what I was

795
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:14,860
looking for but you men you can put

796
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:16,700
anything you want this channel

797
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:19,600
especially if you live in a country

798
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,600
without scruples

799
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:47,540
yeah yeah so I didn't talk to you at all

800
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:50,140
about what I do so the question was it

801
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:54,400
was about the strong-arm product do you

802
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:56,960
deploy it and use it to find malware or

803
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:00,500
is it something that we intend to leave

804
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:03,530
behind so one of the nuances I don't

805
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:05,570
know if anybody caught it but when when

806
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:08,210
the government got good at security the

807
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:10,760
bad people squirted over to enterprise

808
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:12,650
and eventually went down to small

809
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:14,180
businesses and strong-armed is a

810
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:15,710
security product for small midsize

811
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:19,160
businesses so that's what I do

812
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:22,160
I help companies from a hundred people

813
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:24,940
to 500 people protect themselves and so

814
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:28,609
to answer the question

815
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:31,010
Strahm is awesome at finding malware

816
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:33,110
that's embedded in a network you know as

817
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:35,060
long as soon as the thing beacons we

818
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:38,000
find it and talk to it that's that's

819
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:40,880
part of the what the product does but

820
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:44,000
for our especially for small businesses

821
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:47,860
they're they're laden with clickers and

822
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:50,840
so putting strong-armed in and then

823
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:52,820
taking it out doesn't provide them any

824
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:56,930
fishing more malvert icing perfection

825
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:59,180
protection and that's what we you know

826
00:39:56,930 --> 00:40:02,270
that we try and move to the left side of

827
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:04,640
the boom by protecting people from from

828
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:06,759
those kinds of attacks did I answer your

829
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,759
question

830
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:29,060
oh no so we don't we don't do that I

831
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:31,370
apologize if I if I if that's that was

832
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:32,840
your understanding so let me go back and

833
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:41,509
and I didn't give you guys very good

834
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:45,470
context there that stinks so this only

835
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:48,440
happens when we when a victim tries to

836
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:50,480
talk to a command-and-control server all

837
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:53,300
the rest of the traffic no I don't know

838
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:55,340
I I don't see it so that's why that's

839
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:58,280
where we get scalability I'm not

840
00:40:55,340 --> 00:41:01,460
building the proxy here I'm kind of but

841
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:03,080
it's not web proxy right and I'm not

842
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:05,180
going to route everybody's web traffic

843
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:09,049
through it and break SSL in fact I am a

844
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:11,779
staunch opponent of breaking SSL that's

845
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:14,300
that's a beer conversation though so

846
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:17,090
this this what would happen here is if

847
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:22,070
you have a database of indicators as a

848
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:23,300
perfect example and you know where Kemal

849
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:26,240
where command control servers have been

850
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:29,540
set up you add them to a DNS based

851
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:32,450
blacklist and we use the DNS to shunt

852
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:38,050
the traffic over to strongarm that's how

853
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:38,049
works better okay

854
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:11,440
yeah for sure for sure um yeah yeah um

855
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:14,589
so uh you guys can don't care about the

856
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:16,750
story but we so we actually tried to

857
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:21,330
sell this this whole man-in-the-middle

858
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:23,890
thing and either people didn't care

859
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:25,569
because they just want to find out where

860
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:28,109
they've been you know where their

861
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:31,540
victims are and and go get rid of them

862
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:33,130
or they would not accept the risk we've

863
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:35,050
actually had a bunch of people say I

864
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:36,940
cannot leave an attacker on my network

865
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:38,830
and I have some good responses for that

866
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:40,480
and they still weren't buying it so what

867
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:44,130
we did with the product is we split this

868
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:47,110
stuff in half um so our product today is

869
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:49,630
just the black hole so we only see the

870
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:52,870
victim talking but we can still speak

871
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:54,610
malware with it so the victims hey I'm

872
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:58,660
on Todd's computer I'm over here

873
00:42:54,610 --> 00:43:01,900
and we have a we hold the handshake open

874
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:04,810
so that the attacker can't get access to

875
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:07,240
the system we know or its server and in

876
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:09,160
that channel we give it some stuff we

877
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:11,259
give the victim some stuff back until

878
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:15,339
little coffee of information about who

879
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:17,080
it is and that's how we find the victim

880
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:18,910
and help you remediate it quickly and

881
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:21,100
that's what most of our customers want

882
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:23,980
frankly and then we've got some awesome

883
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:25,480
ideas for the red side that we're going

884
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:28,870
to do if everybody knows what show Dan

885
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:32,770
is we're we're going to do some cool

886
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:36,700
stuff with shown in and speaking malware

887
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:40,300
but that that's coming later ask your

888
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:42,930
question okay question in the front can

889
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:42,930
we mic him

890
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:48,879
it seems like you're a fan of handing

891
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:50,200
back information to these attackers just

892
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,390
to see kind of what you can get from

893
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:54,220
them to learn about them oh it was so

894
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:56,319
much more than seeing what you could get

895
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:57,910
it was a well cast rated that's what

896
00:43:56,319 --> 00:44:00,819
emotions so kind of like your product is

897
00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:01,839
somewhat in the you know area of a

898
00:44:00,819 --> 00:44:04,990
honeypot I was going to say are there

899
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:08,380
any a honeypot projects or anything that

900
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:10,629
you recommend checking out or yeah so um

901
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:13,140
we had some colleagues and you know

902
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:18,279
there's there's lots of let's see

903
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:21,730
inbound honey pots and we had some

904
00:44:18,279 --> 00:44:23,109
colleagues that were focused on you know

905
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:24,579
taking taking malware and

906
00:44:23,109 --> 00:44:30,598
double-clicking on it and seeing what

907
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:33,609
happened and that the the challenges is

908
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:35,920
if the environments not good right if

909
00:44:33,609 --> 00:44:39,640
the if the Outlook email box isn't full

910
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:42,970
of email the attackers know that you

911
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:45,129
know pretty much instantly and then then

912
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:47,288
if you don't have that you have to go

913
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:51,220
make it right and everything has to be

914
00:44:47,289 --> 00:44:54,760
perfect and in fact why don't I tell my

915
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:56,078
story as a response to your question so

916
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,930
I get I got a couple minutes and then

917
00:44:56,079 --> 00:45:02,140
I'll have to have to get off the stage

918
00:44:57,930 --> 00:45:06,279
so we took strong-armed and we wanted to

919
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:10,569
apply it to hack credentials so for for

920
00:45:06,279 --> 00:45:12,279
a web app we took the attacker and the

921
00:45:10,569 --> 00:45:14,410
the credentials that we knew were owned

922
00:45:12,279 --> 00:45:16,630
the passwords that was stolen and we

923
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:18,520
shunted them over to a system that we

924
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:20,020
took control of and gave them the

925
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:25,089
information that we wanted to give them

926
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:26,710
it was a total disaster and first of all

927
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:28,690
you got it you have to do this right you

928
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:31,270
have to kind of duplicate real

929
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:34,000
information give give give them a little

930
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:36,009
bit of fake stuff so it's really hard

931
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,410
from a technical perspective and then

932
00:45:36,010 --> 00:45:41,410
the things absolutely fell apart when

933
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:43,270
the attacker had two accounts all they

934
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:44,859
did was logged into the other account

935
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:47,349
and validated that the information was

936
00:45:44,859 --> 00:45:48,910
correct and then at that point we we

937
00:45:47,349 --> 00:45:49,270
just turned the thing off and and walked

938
00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:51,879
away

939
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:54,788
and so from a honeypot perspective we've

940
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:58,380
done a bunch of work in that area but I

941
00:45:54,789 --> 00:45:58,380
I still believe the

942
00:45:58,390 --> 00:46:03,279
you know this this this was somewhat

943
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:07,090
successful when we when we when we

944
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:08,710
deployed it and the the deception social

945
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:10,390
science stuff was those were our two

946
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:11,920
successes and we had lots of research

947
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:15,460
failures lots because that's research

948
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:17,920
trip okay I think I can take one more

949
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:22,110
question I get out you're the boss

950
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:22,110
though yeah
