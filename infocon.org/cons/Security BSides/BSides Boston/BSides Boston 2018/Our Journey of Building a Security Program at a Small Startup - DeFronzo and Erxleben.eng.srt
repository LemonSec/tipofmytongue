security program you guys hear me yes

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:25,500
welcome back to basics our journey of

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:30,599
building a security program at a small

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:35,550
start-up I am DNR Slavin this is Julian

9
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:37,829
the front up yeah so my name is Goan I'm

00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:44,670
my day-to-day is you know dealing with

12
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:46,379
integrations and you know building any

13
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,870
kind of custom integration you can do

14
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:51,000
for our product and also a forward

15
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,579
thinking and research I have some

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,629
background and you know building

17
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:57,539
security programs and some smaller

18
00:00:54,629 --> 00:01:01,289
startups smaller companies but I've also

19
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:05,309
worked in a major Sox provider as well

20
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:07,350
as an analyst I am currently a DevOps

21
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:10,320
engineer but I am sort of a

22
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:13,470
jack-of-all-trades IT guy I do all of

23
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,949
our from help desk to systems engineer

24
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:20,570
to AWS management to cloud management

25
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:26,640
automation configuration management

26
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:29,970
everything I this is my second startup I

27
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:33,450
came from source fire as well as join

28
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,780
and I've been with direct 2-u for about

29
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,259
a year now

30
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:39,270
yeah so the keynote you know our titles

31
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:41,520
you know usually are important but for

32
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,750
this presentation and we'll get to in a

33
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,820
second it's kind of an interesting

34
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:49,890
interesting fact so why are we here so

35
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:53,250
you know we were asked by our security

36
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:55,890
executor our executives of NGOs a lot of

37
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:58,320
them are paranoid and rightfully so to

38
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,990
build a security program and the

39
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,110
challenge and the kicker is without any

40
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:05,880
resources we barely have any budget you

41
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,920
know we don't even have a dedicated

42
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,378
resource or resources to build this

43
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,180
program and that's what I mean by the

44
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:13,410
previous slide is you know dan and I

45
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,790
have day jobs

46
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,980
and we were asked to build you know a

47
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:19,829
security program and security team in

48
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,840
our free time basically so so the point

49
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,010
of this talk is you know to go over some

50
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,460
of those challenges you know what we're

51
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:27,899
focusing on and you know kind of what

52
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:30,870
we're you know trying to achieve you

53
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:33,270
know with what we have and general we

54
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:35,100
have security is easy I mean it means a

55
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,900
lot of its common sense but building a

56
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,989
security program from scratch is hard

57
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,460
you know you try to fight the urge to do

58
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:42,450
all the things and all the cool stuff

59
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,910
that you may have done in a previous

60
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:47,160
life or you know the latest thing you're

61
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:48,960
seeing on Twitter and that's all great

62
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,930
but you know if you don't have the

63
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:54,210
foundation of anything is kind of hard

64
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:57,540
it's hard to know where to prioritize

65
00:02:54,210 --> 00:03:00,690
know where to start and where do you

66
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:02,820
start really the nuts and bolts of our

67
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:05,190
presentation are where do you start when

68
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:08,130
you have limited resources limited time

69
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:11,790
and no funds where do you start when you

70
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:15,299
have an existing culture that you don't

71
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:17,700
want to blow up but want to do the right

72
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:22,560
thing and keep everyone secure and and

73
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:24,359
maintain your your good reputation where

74
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:29,430
do you start when there's no silver

75
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:32,760
bullet - security management automation

76
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:35,310
and orchestration type deals are great

77
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:38,070
when you're a mature company and and you

78
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:40,740
have a team of dedicated security

79
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:45,209
professionals but we're a bunch of like

80
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:48,180
worker bees who are just trying to do

81
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:50,450
the right thing and then keep us moving

82
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:53,700
the right direction

83
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:57,359
the lucky enough that we work for a

84
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:59,070
security company and we are all the

85
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,550
majority of our development team and

86
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:05,670
executives are all executive

87
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:10,170
professionals so we have vast resources

88
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:13,950
to utilize in order to to to move

89
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:16,560
forward and to put these things in place

90
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:18,659
there's an understanding there but we

91
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,470
also don't want to wreck anybody's day

92
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:26,070
to day with strict security guidelines

93
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:26,980
and also we were handed a handful of

94
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,810
guys too

95
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:32,050
uses resources and they all have

96
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:34,240
conflicting things that they've done in

97
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:41,100
the past and everyone of course is right

98
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:41,100
so how you how do we as lower end guys

99
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:49,570
sorry I forgot Julian's internet-famous

100
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:52,990
so yeah how do i as a nobody make it all

101
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:56,050
work the right way there is no there is

102
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:58,060
no right way yeah and to the point about

103
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:00,310
the silver bullets like even if it did

104
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:02,980
exist and if it does and it's free can

105
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:04,360
you guys let us know even if even if

106
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:07,300
there was one we can't afford it like we

107
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,980
have a negative negative budget so you

108
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:11,010
know this is challenging and trying to

109
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:14,740
figure out you know where do you start

110
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:16,300
so you know we put things into into

111
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:18,700
three categories where do we want to

112
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:20,440
start in our initial plan and to start

113
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,180
we wanted to establish a security

114
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,850
centric environment you know in a

115
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:26,920
culture that's security first and you

116
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:28,180
know in a maturing company that's not

117
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,640
going to harsh anyone's buzz we didn't

118
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:32,260
want to impact you know this this you

119
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:36,219
know startup life you know hashtag

120
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:37,960
startup live mentality and we won but we

121
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:40,060
also wanted to you know start having

122
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,739
people think about security the next

123
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,510
thing is you know inventory all the

124
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:45,190
things we wanted to get an idea of you

125
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:48,219
know what's out there who's using what

126
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:50,140
where is data stored and just get an

127
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:52,300
idea of you know where where our holes

128
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:54,490
where where we you know where our gaps

129
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,370
you know what are we missing just to get

130
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:59,740
an understanding of what's out there and

131
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:01,570
lastly is writing policies so you know

132
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:05,110
everybody loves policies both writing

133
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:06,820
and reading so you know it's great when

134
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:09,400
you have to tie that with you know a

135
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,719
startup culture so it's a challenge to

136
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,880
say you know I want to define these

137
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,010
secure practices and policies and

138
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,320
without being overbearing without you

139
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:19,750
know saying hey I'm going to ban all

140
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:23,440
this and you can't do anything except

141
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:25,300
for using PowerPoint um so you know

142
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:29,050
that's you know kind of where we bucket

143
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:30,700
eyes all these things so for culture we

144
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,590
you know we're a security company

145
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:34,150
we like to hire people that are you know

146
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:35,380
passionate about security so we have a

147
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:38,340
lot of people that have an interest

148
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:41,100
whether it be technical or from me

149
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:45,090
you know I'm interested in the market

150
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:47,250
stuff like that anyone is everyone is

151
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:49,200
interested and we want to take advantage

152
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:52,050
that you know establish a culture that's

153
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:55,289
no security first and by doing that you

154
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:56,820
know people you know people care and we

155
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:59,550
broke it down in two things we wanted to

156
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:02,159
be visible as a team and we wanted to

157
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:03,900
effectively communicate to everyone you

158
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,720
know we're you know predominantly a

159
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:10,229
remote company I think but what eighty

160
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,790
percent of our workforce is remote but

161
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:14,340
we wanted to establish this

162
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:16,230
quote/unquote open-door policy you know

163
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:18,119
we want to make sure that people are you

164
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:19,350
know know who we are as a team you know

165
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,570
what we're trying to achieve and you

166
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:25,050
know you know put you know you know

167
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:27,420
faces the names and and whatnot you know

168
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:29,550
so that we're not seeing as that you

169
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,960
know working security team that's you

170
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:32,790
know in the shadows and you don't really

171
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,419
know who they are clear them they tell

172
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:38,550
me what I can and can't do and you know

173
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:40,920
a big chunk of that is you know pooping

174
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:42,510
black channels right so we you know like

175
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:45,480
every startup or really any company

176
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:47,580
nowadays is it wisdom was in flack so we

177
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:50,220
have these channels you know that are

178
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:52,109
open to you know discuss news topics or

179
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,570
even go in-depth we have separate

180
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:56,730
channels that are more technically

181
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:58,469
involved about certain breaches or you

182
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:00,750
know I found this tool and I use this

183
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:02,430
and you know and why it's cool and stuff

184
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:04,260
like that and we kind of do we're

185
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:06,120
starting to do some you know brown bags

186
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:10,500
and stuff like that to further that

187
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:12,420
point you know and you know by doing

188
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,730
that people feel welcome to talk about

189
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:17,220
security we also have an open you know

190
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:18,600
security channel to you know for people

191
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:21,060
to ask questions you know you know

192
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,470
what's the best way to you know what's

193
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,420
the best password manager or stuff like

194
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:26,220
that simple questions that you know can

195
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:28,470
you Dan and I or anyone can really ask

196
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:30,450
and it's not really just us answering

197
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:33,450
questions it's you know everyone in the

198
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:35,100
company is free to you know answer you

199
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:36,330
know give any advice and stuff like that

200
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:39,330
because that's it's what we're trying

201
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:41,220
that's overall about and the second

202
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:43,110
thing is effective communication we

203
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:45,000
wanted to establish this cadence of

204
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:46,710
communication with our employees so that

205
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,780
they're used to hearing from us so we're

206
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:50,370
not we're not just again telling them

207
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:52,050
what they can and can't do we wanted to

208
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:54,959
you know bug the crap out

209
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:57,569
in a good way to say hey we're here you

210
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,969
should keep thinking about security and

211
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:03,080
this is why so the best example we have

212
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:04,940
is you know every week we have a email

213
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:07,110
communication to the our whole company

214
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:09,329
they usually talks about like news and

215
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:10,700
events and you know any kind of social

216
00:09:09,329 --> 00:09:13,920
media campaigns we're doing as a company

217
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:16,680
so we carved out a section to talk about

218
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,079
security and most weeks it's about news

219
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,819
you know what happened in the last week

220
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:23,420
any kind of analysis around this kind of

221
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:26,339
stuff but we also talked about you know

222
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:28,979
dress like blog articles and you know

223
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:30,570
giving you know writing out stories

224
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:33,839
about you know what's new what password

225
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,860
manager like up here like this is the

226
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,420
types of things that you should think

227
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:39,480
about use a passive rendering and here's

228
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:44,279
why and you know give it kind of total

229
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:46,529
information about that and you know this

230
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:49,829
is letting us set the groundwork for

231
00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:52,680
once we start writing policies and you

232
00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:54,750
know enacting these standards too before

233
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,430
we do that we're kind of backing up our

234
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:58,140
reasoning right so you know before we

235
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:01,140
say hey you need to enable two-factor

236
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:02,579
authentication on everything is hey you

237
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:04,410
should start doing this in your personal

238
00:10:02,579 --> 00:10:06,149
life you should start doing these things

239
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:08,310
and you know we're backing it up and

240
00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:09,690
we're not just saying hey you need to do

241
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:11,550
this it's hey you need to do this and

242
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:14,070
here's why and have this open dialogue

243
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:16,800
about these things so we've had people

244
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:18,899
you know respond say hey I use this

245
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,899
password manager or hey I'm doing this

246
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:24,779
and it kind of opens that dialogue there

247
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:27,300
and you know we're trying to do this you

248
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:29,220
know without being this overly stuffy

249
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,990
stereotypical security team so we're you

250
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,130
know we're light hearted for the most

251
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:36,480
part even though Dan's

252
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:38,430
rough exterior then we as you'll see

253
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,320
later on and you know in previous slides

254
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:44,300
you know we have memes because that's

255
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:48,199
important but only when appropriate so

256
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:52,589
so inventory all the things we adopted a

257
00:10:48,199 --> 00:10:55,439
crawl walk yog type mentality when we

258
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:58,910
first started meeting and approaching

259
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,899
security as a whole spreadsheets

260
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:03,510
everyone loves spreadsheets as much

261
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:05,910
small C's but we need to know we need to

262
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:08,220
create a security baseline

263
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:12,750
we started with documenting literally

264
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:15,060
everything we're a young company but no

265
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:17,430
one knows where anything is so we

266
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:19,680
started with creating a central location

267
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:23,270
we use Google Docs to to maintain

268
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:26,579
everything and and collaborate as a team

269
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:28,890
we started off documenting all of our

270
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:32,150
known Hardware all of our laptops

271
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:37,020
everything that's piecing together old

272
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:39,630
audits and receipts and we we figure out

273
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:42,300
how many Windows laptops and Mac laptops

274
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:44,370
to network devices and what printers are

275
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:47,819
out there and we've standardized our

276
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:52,850
networking equipment but what's plugged

277
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:56,250
into those ASAS that we're managing and

278
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:59,460
that allows us to to attack what the

279
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:02,420
most vulnerable of those are when we get

280
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:04,920
around to our actionable items

281
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:11,640
documenting all of our software we use a

282
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:14,160
lot a of cloud tech and how who's

283
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,810
managing those softwares who's managing

284
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,160
those licenses if they have a license

285
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:19,050
who knows when they're going to expire

286
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:22,319
it's it's really embarrassing when your

287
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:24,630
your your SSL cert for your website goes

288
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,890
expiring though isn't it so we need to

289
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:28,470
know what the point of contact for

290
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:30,600
literally everything in our our company

291
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:32,760
is and we're young startup and we've

292
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:37,170
been flying by night so how do we reel

293
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:39,270
in all of that spreadsheet hell then we

294
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:43,620
get to do some of the fun stuff by

295
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:45,449
moving on to the network scans you can

296
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:47,670
start off with netizen and map scans

297
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:52,290
just to validate what you're you're

298
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:56,849
putting on paper but you just we use a

299
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:58,500
lot of demo softwares and free licensing

300
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:01,230
and some open source stuff to get a

301
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,790
better idea of what what are in

302
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:04,980
destructor is really made of we we work

303
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:06,930
out of Colo for most of our development

304
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:10,070
so we want to make sure that we know

305
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:12,359
exactly what is behind that firewall

306
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:14,010
moving forward we don't know we don't

307
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,680
manage it we don't have hands on the

308
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:18,210
ground we have to know in case anybody

309
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,670
plugged anything and that shouldn't get

310
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:22,200
plugged in

311
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:25,530
same with vulnerability management we're

312
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:28,130
using free wares and demos to sort of

313
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:30,240
get an idea of what our baseline

314
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:40,320
vulnerabilities are of our current

315
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:44,190
infrastructure my favorite slide who's

316
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:46,280
your daddy and what do you do data we

317
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:49,230
move on to remove from hardware to data

318
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:51,839
and who are your most vulnerable people

319
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:55,370
your front office and your HR people

320
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:58,470
people who are primarily Windows users

321
00:13:55,370 --> 00:14:02,010
who in a start-up you don't have

322
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:03,480
policies in effect yet so data to be

323
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:06,240
literally anywhere they could be sitting

324
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:10,590
on unencrypted laptops sitting in chairs

325
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:13,200
with no with shared usernames and

326
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:15,660
passwords and no two-factor

327
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:18,540
authentication so it was an exhaustive

328
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:21,569
process of interviews sitting down with

329
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:23,310
your CFO and your HR reps and getting an

330
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:28,020
idea of all of the software they use and

331
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:30,030
where their data is and it it went in to

332
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:31,470
our inside-out mentality where we

333
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:33,689
started only inside and found out where

334
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:37,350
all the the real vulnerabilities are

335
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:39,600
which are as we found out mostly people

336
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:42,810
mostly users from other reservations

337
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,330
today so we're able to strike on some of

338
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:48,780
the low-hanging fruit like encrypting

339
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:52,110
hard drives and managing user accounts

340
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:57,329
and these cloud software's that we don't

341
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:59,130
know we had no access to and making

342
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:03,690
through factor authentication like a

343
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:06,120
thing for everyone so actually before

344
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:08,370
we're going to next slide and the goal

345
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,350
for this wasn't to call people out for

346
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:12,240
you know being dumb or wrong or not

347
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:13,440
doing secure things it's we just won't

348
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,900
understand what people are doing right

349
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,880
so we can't protect what we don't know

350
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,319
and just by understanding how people are

351
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,870
using certain tools where they're

352
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,550
storing things we just get a better

353
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:25,560
sense of you know the workflow of

354
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:27,540
everything and then we can say ok well

355
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:29,189
you know I know you're using these tools

356
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:30,870
and you're doing these practices and we

357
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:32,000
don't want to disrupt you because we're

358
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:33,199
all about trying to get

359
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,569
customers and everything right now

360
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:38,209
because we're so early stage but let's

361
00:15:35,569 --> 00:15:39,800
inject some some security into those

362
00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:43,399
practices without disrupting your life

363
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:44,689
all right so you're thinking just enable

364
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:46,550
two-factor authentication like Dan said

365
00:15:44,689 --> 00:15:47,990
you know encrypting your laptop if

366
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:50,120
you're going to store stuff locally all

367
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:52,910
the simple wins that we can do we went

368
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:55,459
out and we tried to knock out and for

369
00:15:52,910 --> 00:16:00,170
interviewing we did not do that we did

370
00:15:55,459 --> 00:16:02,569
not beat them up obviously so policies I

371
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:05,269
know I talked about earlier and we love

372
00:16:02,569 --> 00:16:09,860
we all love writing policies we all love

373
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:11,420
reading them so even you know outside of

374
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:13,639
the startup no one likes to do that so

375
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:15,979
when you factor in a startup culture

376
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:17,930
it's you know it's a challenge that we

377
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:22,189
mean that we need to you know need to

378
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:23,599
respect our culture we don't want to no

379
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:25,009
one wants to read these strict dense

380
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,860
policies that tell them what they can

381
00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:29,660
and can't do and we need to tailor our

382
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:31,550
you know everything that we write to our

383
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:34,399
audience and we also at the same time

384
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:36,649
after remember how mature we are as both

385
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,449
a security program and as a company so

386
00:16:36,649 --> 00:16:39,670
that comes into play when we need to

387
00:16:38,449 --> 00:16:41,839
pick out what we need to start

388
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:44,389
standardizing or what policies we need

389
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,610
to start this and you know that's kind

390
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:48,019
of where we you know we sat down and

391
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:50,750
we're like well you know we're just

392
00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:51,829
building these things what are the what

393
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:54,050
are the three things that we want to do

394
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:57,680
and you know with that its first thing

395
00:16:54,050 --> 00:17:00,559
was workstation standards we identified

396
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,809
that we have you know you know 60 or so

397
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:04,849
Macs and you know and number windows

398
00:17:02,809 --> 00:17:07,939
machines so we went scour the web for

399
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:09,619
best practices and standards and you

400
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:11,480
know stuff like full disk encryption you

401
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:15,109
can strong complex passwords firewall

402
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:18,289
screen timeout stuff like that to to you

403
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:20,780
know memorialize in the standard and you

404
00:17:18,289 --> 00:17:22,819
know the goal was to for loot to be no

405
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:24,918
surprises for our users no one should be

406
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:26,658
reading this and say oh I don't want to

407
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:29,360
do that that's dumb it should be nothing

408
00:17:26,659 --> 00:17:30,980
to be terribly inconvenient it's oh yeah

409
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,379
this is obvious I already do this when I

410
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:34,970
first got my laptop anyway so that's

411
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:38,570
kind of how we approach those were

412
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:42,230
played workstation standards the next is

413
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:44,429
acceptable use policy you know a lot of

414
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:46,050
time when people see you know

415
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:48,510
the term acceptable use they start to

416
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:50,760
hyperventilate because now you're

417
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:52,290
telling me that I have to use my laptop

418
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:55,700
in a certain way at a certain time and

419
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:58,139
stuff like that but it's incredibly

420
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:00,810
important to start laying out and

421
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:03,540
putting some some walls and rules around

422
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:06,000
how our users can start using their

423
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:07,800
machines you know just just you know

424
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,840
cover ass really err just to understand

425
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:14,040
you know making sure that we are

426
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:15,810
identifying some of the you know attack

427
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,889
surfaces in our environment so we want

428
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:18,780
to make sure that people aren't you know

429
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:21,030
downloading installing software that's

430
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:23,220
not necessarily you needed further

431
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:26,430
day-to-day job and it's all going to be

432
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:27,930
common sense and you know startup

433
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:30,930
friendly language you know it's going to

434
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:32,340
be no not this super long document with

435
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:35,190
tons of bullet points we're going to

436
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:36,770
have you know a nice one pager to cover

437
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:39,150
everything that you can easily

438
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:40,710
understand and it's again we're not

439
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:42,000
banning everything we're loosing the

440
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:44,940
reins a little bit we want to empower

441
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,250
our users to make good decisions but at

442
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:50,220
the same time we need to have some some

443
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:51,960
documentation around that and then

444
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,040
lastly something that's near and dear to

445
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,160
my heart which is vulnerability

446
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:58,950
management you know we wanted to

447
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:01,230
identify you know what that even means

448
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:04,140
for us right so what are the tools we

449
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:05,370
can use how can we use them I knocked my

450
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:09,060
first malt that I started out to our

451
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:12,360
quotient MariaDB came out with a number

452
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:15,780
of vulnerabilities that you know scared

453
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,949
the crap out of some executives and so

454
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,649
they came to us and we're like what do

455
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:22,110
we do where they're all panicking like

456
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:24,960
tickets with their head cut off so I'm

457
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:26,520
like well this can't happen again so

458
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,920
this is a prime example of we started

459
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,150
with our products at first right so

460
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:33,030
identified that you know there's some

461
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:35,640
gaps in how we can handle the future of

462
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:39,540
area DB vulnerabilities because they

463
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:41,850
bring us a lot of sadness so we wanted

464
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:44,310
to identify you know who's involved in

465
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:46,050
this remediation process right so you

466
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:48,120
know who who does the work for the

467
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:49,680
patching how do we how can we place it

468
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,389
in what Sprint is going to happen what

469
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,830
release it's going to happen and how do

470
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:55,860
we you know communicate that effectively

471
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:57,780
to our scrum manager and you know

472
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:59,610
everyone involved in the process

473
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:01,860
you know how do we communicate to our

474
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:03,178
customers that this is you know this

475
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:05,418
happened this is when it's coming out

476
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:08,669
with a release so just it's a high-level

477
00:20:05,419 --> 00:20:11,490
process that we came up with but it

478
00:20:08,669 --> 00:20:13,679
saves us you know a lot because we've

479
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:15,500
had a number of times whether it be you

480
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,210
know vulnerability drops and we find out

481
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,620
on our own research or customers come to

482
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:22,289
say hey I've identified these

483
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:23,668
vulnerabilities we can say oh we know

484
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:25,740
this when you already know that and we

485
00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:27,780
have this in an upcoming release or it's

486
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:29,039
oh that's something we need to identify

487
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:31,350
and we work that through our process

488
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:32,908
that we've defined and again because

489
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:34,799
we're a security company this like this

490
00:20:32,909 --> 00:20:37,049
is something we need to nail so that

491
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:40,110
we're seeing as you know I'm mature we

492
00:20:37,049 --> 00:20:41,789
know what we're doing you know when the

493
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:44,010
next step after that is you know

494
00:20:41,789 --> 00:20:47,280
vulnerability management of our eternal

495
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:48,900
infrastructure you know it's this is

496
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,580
kind of easy right now just because we

497
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:52,710
can use the previous process and also

498
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:54,689
it's basically just me and Dan so I can

499
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:56,370
just do our scan and say hey Dan fix

500
00:20:54,690 --> 00:21:00,419
this and we he'll catch it in five

501
00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:03,600
minutes but by defining this process now

502
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:05,309
we can start evolving it once we start

503
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,530
if we were to double or triple in size

504
00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:10,530
over the next few years and where we're

505
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:11,850
going to need a more mature process by

506
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:14,639
having it now and you know just

507
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:16,379
identifying any kind of problems early

508
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:21,480
on it's going to make make our lives a

509
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:23,760
lot easier in the long run so now we

510
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,559
have policies we have procedures we have

511
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,940
lots of documentation how do we start

512
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:28,320
enforcing these things when you're a

513
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:32,460
remote company like we said earlier

514
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:35,939
we're eighty percent mostly 80% remote

515
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:39,000
and and a lot of companies are taking on

516
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:42,210
the remote environment so we've come up

517
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,789
with standardized security trainings

518
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:47,159
we've come up with slides and we're

519
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:49,169
making it mandatory for new employees as

520
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:50,490
well as existing employees and some

521
00:21:49,169 --> 00:21:53,460
certain employees are getting extra

522
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:56,309
security trainings we publish all of our

523
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:58,760
documentation to a public wiki and we

524
00:21:56,309 --> 00:22:02,039
direct people and like our Runner reader

525
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:07,830
blurbs to to documents in our in our

526
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:09,419
wiki and we agreed on a a standard of

527
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:11,210
tools and apps for everyone to really

528
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:15,679
use like a standard browser

529
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:18,590
like malware detection we'd like

530
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:22,309
everyone to be Mac OS but there are some

531
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:24,610
people that refuse to use it but I

532
00:22:22,309 --> 00:22:27,080
digress

533
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:28,969
so with that you know what comes next

534
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:32,149
what do what do we do after we've done

535
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:33,470
these things and it's you know it's time

536
00:22:32,149 --> 00:22:35,479
to do real security work you know

537
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:37,549
assuming we can find some free time and

538
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,980
you know some free resources and you

539
00:22:37,549 --> 00:22:41,510
know interested people let's start

540
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:44,510
enforcing the policies and standards

541
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:46,879
that we just sent out to everyone you

542
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:48,470
know start actually doing like what are

543
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:52,789
the other cool security team is doing

544
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:54,049
Netflix and Amazon and rapid7 you know

545
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:57,370
what are they doing and start like

546
00:22:54,049 --> 00:23:00,770
mimicking that and start to figure out

547
00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:02,360
what to do so you know we've said that

548
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:04,399
two-factor authentication is important

549
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:06,469
let's start doing that on more than just

550
00:23:04,399 --> 00:23:09,020
Gmail if it's enacted on all of our

551
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:11,480
systems any kind of cloud-based things

552
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:15,559
that help me offer it just enable it and

553
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:17,570
use it and force that um you know let's

554
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:21,470
start centrally logging all of our stuff

555
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:22,700
because we're got a lot of sprawl going

556
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:25,490
on so we just want to be able to

557
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:27,490
identify what you know if there's any

558
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:29,899
attackers that are already there

559
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:32,149
let's automate some vulnerability scans

560
00:23:29,899 --> 00:23:34,039
and you know automatically remediate

561
00:23:32,149 --> 00:23:35,629
those things because we're such you know

562
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:37,520
a small environment for the most part

563
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:40,010
this should be using it's you know I do

564
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,960
a scan with a tool here the results puts

565
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:43,429
us automatically Patchogue boxes we

566
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,289
don't have much of an impact right now

567
00:23:43,429 --> 00:23:50,440
so if we figure out that process now

568
00:23:45,289 --> 00:23:53,840
it'll make it a lot easier both words

569
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:55,429
they're out there CIOs top controls is

570
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,520
something we've adopted as a standard

571
00:23:55,429 --> 00:24:01,130
we've made it through three of the top

572
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:06,470
five want to keep moving forward with

573
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:07,970
that automating the mundane stuff we

574
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:09,470
want to automate from a DevOps

575
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:11,870
perspective we want to automate as much

576
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:14,270
as humanly possible but we also want to

577
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:17,750
inject security into that procedures

578
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:21,200
like for instance we have a full-on QA

579
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:23,750
Jenkins chain that gets kicked off with

580
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,480
every PR but with every pull request

581
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:27,090
there

582
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,030
a the code gets dumped to a one of the

583
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:31,439
slave nodes and gets scanned by a

584
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:33,059
malware scanner so that we know that

585
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,150
everything that is getting eventually

586
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:40,040
dumped on to our repos and our servers

587
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:43,110
are our malware free to our knowledge

588
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:46,020
and also a new hot new thing is this

589
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:47,909
concept of chat ups and you know being

590
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:50,460
that we live in slack it's a great

591
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:52,049
opportunity to let's just have BOTS to

592
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:55,410
do all our work for us because not like

593
00:24:52,049 --> 00:24:57,660
we have the time to do it anyway so you

594
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:59,580
know notify us you know if we once we

595
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:03,390
have the central logging notify us of

596
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:04,770
all the weird you know if people if

597
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:06,809
we can you know automate you know

598
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:08,940
responses to simple questions and are in

599
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:10,918
our security channel say hey you know I

600
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:13,320
was you know kind of read those and you

601
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:15,000
know give you know helpful responses and

602
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,678
that's a kind of a quick win just

603
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,770
because we just we can't always be

604
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:21,450
watching other channels you know and

605
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:22,918
also you know make sure that people

606
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:24,750
aren't just pasting passwords and API

607
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:26,460
keys and stuff like that all throughout

608
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:29,400
our channels a lot of our development

609
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:32,130
and our engineering side is based on

610
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:34,140
using third-party api's so there's

611
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:35,580
plenty of API keys being shared around

612
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:39,179
so it's something that we can tighten up

613
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:41,760
for sure so that's kind of this whole

614
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:45,210
new nebulous thing of chat apps and

615
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,890
lastly let's user on product now our

616
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:49,530
product for those who don't know is a

617
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:51,780
threat intelligence platform I'm not

618
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:54,750
gonna get too much details because also

619
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:57,270
not a lot of time but like it's designed

620
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:58,770
for more mature security organizations

621
00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:01,320
that have the threat Intel team or a

622
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:05,070
threat hunting team or really anyone

623
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:06,870
that's that's focusing on that so we're

624
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:09,629
not ready for that but we can you know

625
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:12,149
start tailoring it towards our needs you

626
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:14,130
know how do we use how can we use our

627
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:16,679
product to further enhance you know

628
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:18,570
further future enhancements or no this

629
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:20,130
is how you know I've noticed this wonky

630
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:21,960
behavior you know it's kind of this full

631
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:24,390
circle of we're using it for our own

632
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:26,370
defense we're also enhancing our own

633
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:28,020
product so it kind of you know helps a

634
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:29,760
lot of people by doing that so it's

635
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:33,210
something that where you need to figure

636
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:36,270
out just because you know we don't have

637
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:38,070
much use yet for a threat Intel at Forum

638
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:40,200
but you know our platform is so

639
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:42,840
exelon offset so there's plenty of

640
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:50,330
things that we can do with it to help us

641
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:50,330
out and that's it we got a call we got

642
00:26:53,210 --> 00:27:22,290
any questions so the question is we know

643
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:25,860
we are kind of generic on what tools we

644
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:28,550
use we did that on purpose just being

645
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:34,139
it's a lot of you here to be agnostic

646
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:35,520
but you know where I want to answer your

647
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,810
question but we don't want to be get too

648
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,920
specific on what tools just because we

649
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:41,580
had those relationships but you haven't

650
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:44,250
paid or adopted anything we're making do

651
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:47,520
with a baseline information from from

652
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:50,010
demos and and and sort of deciding on

653
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:52,379
what gives us what we need for the best

654
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:53,490
call yeah so we're still actually like

655
