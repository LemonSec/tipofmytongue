1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:06,629
all right so how we got here so here are

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,400
the two so over this is something that I

3
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:10,649
developed over the course of literally

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,509
it's been the last five years so first

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:17,369
off anybody have a relative who does not

6
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:18,869
own a computer I have a couple and um I

7
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:21,289
have a couple that had never owned a

8
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:24,300
computer and I think they never will and

9
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:25,740
one of them in particular asks a lot of

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,390
questions like you know one of them is

11
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,619
he's a retired insurance executive and I

12
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,140
think he's kind of a product of the Mad

13
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:32,940
Men era a long time ago and and he reads

14
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,350
the kind of the security news headlines

15
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,269
and reads about things like data

16
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,920
breaches and security disaster isn't he

17
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,670
and he says things to me like why do you

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,140
let this happen

19
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,739
why do you run your business this way

20
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,780
and so for a long time I really couldn't

21
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:47,160
figure out how to explain to him why

22
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,950
these things happen and how we got to

23
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,480
this place eventually I did and I'll

24
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,410
show you and that's kind of how I went

25
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,569
down this road and I'll show you how

26
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,309
that evolved secondly I was at a dinner

27
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,109
this all started I was at a dinner in

28
00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:00,089
Austin about five years ago with a bunch

29
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:01,199
of security researchers and there was

30
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,910
some very important people there from

31
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,289
DHS and one of them in particular was a

32
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,060
very important person he wanted to start

33
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,700
regulating software security and wanted

34
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,140
to start immediately and we were trying

35
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,729
to he was asking us why can't I just do

36
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,439
this tomorrow using product X and I'll

37
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:15,060
just say you need to pass a scan by

38
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,470
product X and that's what you have to do

39
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,689
or trying to explain to them why I can't

40
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:21,750
do that and that's actually an

41
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:24,658
interesting conversation so as far as

42
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,590
the problem statement so we know that by

43
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,360
the way I'm going to apologize in

44
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,009
advance for my art skills I did not have

45
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,509
the support of a marketing department in

46
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:32,729
producing that so this is this is pure

47
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:34,590
research so the good news is this is

48
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:36,659
pure research with no marketing agenda

49
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:41,939
whatsoever but the bad news is my art

50
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:43,079
skills so um obviously you know we all

51
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:46,048
we have to do is look at the headlines

52
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:47,789
to see that there are security problems

53
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,670
and security disasters across the

54
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:53,250
landscape of growing size and intensity

55
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:55,500
as you can see security disasters are

56
00:01:53,250 --> 00:02:00,869
actually getting larger as the years go

57
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:03,570
by and more dramatic and if we look at

58
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:05,250
on this is this is a little bit hard to

59
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,689
read I apologize because this is a photo

60
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,020
and I don't have the original yet but

61
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:11,640
what this is showing us is that done

62
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:13,170
there could have been studying software

63
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,529
security metrics for a long time

64
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,299
using

65
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,790
really large data sets and what they're

66
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,440
finding is that a lot of the metrics are

67
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:20,850
not going in the right direction some of

68
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,380
them are treading water and some of them

69
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:24,690
are not getting better in terms of

70
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,859
software security quality and this for

71
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:28,109
example what this is showing us is that

72
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:31,560
it turns out that most applications

73
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:34,350
actually fail their first Oh wasp top 10

74
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,239
assessment in terms of do you pass or

75
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:37,890
fail do you have you know have you

76
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,230
successfully avoided implementing the

77
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,100
top 10 classes of security bugs is

78
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,929
defined by wasp

79
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:45,510
most applications fail at that that

80
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:47,010
first time it's not so much fail fail

81
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,359
might be the wrong word it's probably

82
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:52,260
more case if they just haven't actually

83
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:54,450
tried to think about doing that yet this

84
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,459
is just another kind of random data

85
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:58,679
point this is a chart of sequel

86
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:01,290
injection vulnerabilities found in PHP

87
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,510
questions and Stack Overflow and this is

88
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:09,239
this is going back over roughly the last

89
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:10,470
decade or so and so um over the course

90
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:12,030
of the last five years is that

91
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:14,640
developing these talks we've had lots of

92
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:17,130
dramatic exchanges on Twitter where

93
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,109
people like you know the Cisco CEO lots

94
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,730
of people like the Cisco CR saying every

95
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,690
company will be broken into everything

96
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,250
will be broken into eventually

97
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:25,590
everybody's going to have a security

98
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:27,780
problem then we have you know the latest

99
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:28,950
trend in financial services now is there

100
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,780
are security teams now that have

101
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:32,850
unlimited budgets which apparently is a

102
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,350
thing in some companies they don't have

103
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:38,280
a budget they just get what they need on

104
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:39,660
their code gives a lot of really data

105
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,640
rich talks and one of the one of the

106
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,680
points that they make is that one of the

107
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,790
trends they're observing is that

108
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,620
security is getting so difficult that

109
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:48,480
the tenure for a chief information

110
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,030
security officer is actually contracting

111
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,149
that the average tenure for seaso is

112
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:56,459
down to about 18 months now just because

113
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:59,970
they have more problems and solutions

114
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:02,640
alright so why do we have soft so going

115
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:03,930
back to my my older relative is never

116
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,600
owned a computer it doesn't understand

117
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:09,269
any of what he sees in the news why when

118
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,858
somebody like this asks why do we why do

119
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:13,079
we let this happen why we have why don't

120
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:15,510
we fix software security and just stop

121
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:17,250
just make it stop you know this is a

122
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:18,930
little bit like trying to explain colors

123
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:22,950
to a blind person it's a really hard

124
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:24,210
problem so in order to do that so in

125
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:25,830
order to dig into this first I want to

126
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,810
dispense with some of the conventional

127
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:31,229
wisdom which I consider my

128
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:33,330
ecology so this on these four things are

129
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,830
really popular conventional wisdom that

130
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:36,659
I've encountered over the course of

131
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:38,130
being a security lead and the chief

132
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,919
security architect a number of times

133
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:43,260
just working in in software

134
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:45,180
manufacturers large and small working in

135
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,860
both software manufacturers and software

136
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,840
producing organizations that created

137
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:51,450
software for internal use but didn't

138
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,638
sell this is not a talk about a

139
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:55,500
particular software manufacturer this is

140
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:57,150
about all software manufacturers these

141
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,760
economic forces applied to the entire

142
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:01,138
marketplace not to one company or

143
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,639
another so I don't want anybody to try

144
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:05,400
to infer that this is a this is about

145
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,930
inside you know acne you know this isn't

146
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,700
about inside you know income and

147
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:11,460
software security fail at company X this

148
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:14,930
is about the marketplace so let's let's

149
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:17,909
dispense with this very quickly first so

150
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:19,530
these are the four major myths and I

151
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:23,340
want to just go through them one at a

152
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:25,169
time so first one is it's a network

153
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:27,119
security problem right so we need to go

154
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:29,460
to black cat and buy all the boxes that

155
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,710
we see in a black cat RSA and just buy

156
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:33,510
everything in sight and then we will

157
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:35,580
have security this is a myth that we've

158
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:38,310
been chasing for a long time problem is

159
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:40,020
software security and application

160
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:43,110
security software engineering is not a

161
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:47,310
network security problem it's a it's a

162
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:48,650
code security quality problem so like we

163
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:51,150
can pretty much agree on that

164
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:52,739
next sometimes you see people do is they

165
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:55,140
go in this product they go in this

166
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:57,570
direction of well it's a it's a it's a

167
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:59,700
process or a methodology problem or it's

168
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:01,110
you know well we need a process and then

169
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,479
the next thing is what we need a project

170
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:05,010
manager now or a program manager or

171
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:07,289
something like this to kind of manage

172
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:09,810
the problem and you know report on

173
00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:12,539
metrics and kind of measure the badness

174
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:15,660
and try to tell everybody what to do I

175
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:18,419
mean this is you know measuring things

176
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:20,220
is good but a project manager alone like

177
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:22,020
throwing a project manager to at the

178
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:24,090
problem in writing reports is not going

179
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:27,180
to change the quality levels of your

180
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:29,429
software next it's a business problem

181
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:32,220
right so this is another popular

182
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:33,960
mythology used to be more popular than

183
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,760
it is now where you have people walking

184
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,430
around saying well you need you know

185
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:41,580
executive buy-in what you know you need

186
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:46,470
CEO buy-in in order to solve security

187
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:49,680
this I think is mostly a myth because

188
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:52,590
you know this never happens right this

189
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,389
is not our problem right no CEO will

190
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:56,909
ever take this position because he can't

191
00:06:54,389 --> 00:07:00,780
or she can't it's not reasonable right

192
00:06:56,909 --> 00:07:04,259
but again the CEO the CEO the cxl

193
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:06,599
whether its CEO CTO CRO etc etc they're

194
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:07,080
not the bottleneck the bottleneck is

195
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:14,370
elsewhere

196
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:15,810
no because CXOs do not decide what

197
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:19,680
engineering teams are going to work on

198
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:21,840
this week this month this year they're

199
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,880
just there they're floating many levels

200
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,948
above that so they're the bottleneck is

201
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:28,530
elsewhere so let's talk about the

202
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:31,830
organization so software manufacturers

203
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:33,900
are organized on differently but there's

204
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:36,210
a there are common organizational

205
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:39,000
patterns in most software manufacturers

206
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:42,180
so typically we have squads of

207
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,650
developers and with a team lead or so

208
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,030
you have junior developers senior

209
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:46,859
developers and you have things like

210
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:49,409
principal developers and you'll have

211
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:51,150
something like a chief architect or a

212
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:52,530
lead architect or Li developer you know

213
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:54,388
basically you have you have teams of

214
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:56,239
developers and you have unit leaders of

215
00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:59,130
some kind whatever we call them and

216
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,990
right and this is not how they decide

217
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:02,969
what to do right this is not how

218
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:06,240
software gets built so this is why the

219
00:08:02,969 --> 00:08:08,009
CEO is not the bottleneck by the way

220
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,409
these are I'm using personas here from

221
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:12,990
dr. Strangelove because are there there

222
00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:15,449
are a lot of personas in this talk as we

223
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:17,039
talk about stakeholders and organisms

224
00:08:15,449 --> 00:08:18,659
and figures in the software

225
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,818
manufacturing organization so I'm

226
00:08:18,659 --> 00:08:22,259
actually using Strangelove characters as

227
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:24,719
personas just to help us keep them

228
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:26,759
straight also to make it more more fun

229
00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:28,529
and entertaining right alright so next

230
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:31,080
it's an engineering problem so how many

231
00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:33,000
times have we seen security teams like

232
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,649
you know security teams for some reason

233
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,029
loves to hate on developers and say well

234
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:37,950
we need to train the developers we need

235
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:40,260
to yell at the developers we need to run

236
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:42,270
you know scan reports and drop 800 pH

237
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,970
scan reports you know raw results on

238
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:47,220
them every hour or every day we'll do

239
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:49,200
that until they surrender and they agree

240
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:54,209
to do what we want right this is not

241
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,960
useful no why well where this leads is

242
00:08:54,209 --> 00:08:56,339
on

243
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,980
actually leads to a really bad place

244
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,900
because then what you have is you have

245
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,980
in many organizations you have security

246
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:04,829
saying well we need to train the

247
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:06,180
developers and then um you know the

248
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:09,720
Department of security doesn't always

249
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:11,849
have a elaborate budget for this kind of

250
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,170
training so security will guide security

251
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:15,000
out will often go and buy you know

252
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:18,870
security or compliance will often buy

253
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:23,870
these kind of box training products that

254
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:27,420
are very rudimentary and very generic

255
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:29,730
and then you have this and this this is

256
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:31,740
wrong right this this has to stop

257
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:33,300
this never happens in my organization's

258
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,530
I make sure that it doesn't and this is

259
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,780
something that you know it isn't

260
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:38,189
productive it isn't useful but it also

261
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:40,650
it's kind of a name

262
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:42,660
why because developers are not the

263
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:44,130
developers also are not the problem

264
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,770
they're not where the bottleneck is

265
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:49,530
because why because if you think about

266
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:52,230
you know this the reason that this is is

267
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:54,329
in vain it's because most developers are

268
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:55,920
actually highly educated and some of

269
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:57,270
them are actually very intelligent and

270
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,990
very experienced and very good at what

271
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:03,630
they do at least many of them are um

272
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:07,890
most most of my developers if I ask them

273
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:10,020
to solve you know an XSS or sequel I or

274
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:12,120
a remote command injection or any number

275
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:13,860
of a hundred other things but ask them

276
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,300
to solve it they'll solve it and they

277
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,740
don't need to go back to school to do

278
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,569
that because they're good at their

279
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,770
developers are good at figuring out how

280
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:22,020
to build what you want them to build

281
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:25,140
because that's what they do so you know

282
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:27,660
training is not you know simple generic

283
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:29,100
training classes and powerpoints and you

284
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:31,260
know computer-animated training things

285
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,540
are not the answer now there are

286
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:35,550
exceptions there are things like crypto

287
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:38,130
and key management that get very complex

288
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:40,079
and do require specialized knowledge and

289
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:41,520
even external audits and you may need to

290
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,650
go and get somebody like a Don Davis

291
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:46,230
from MIT or somebody to help you figure

292
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:48,689
that stuff out right but fixing an XSS

293
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:51,030
doesn't require going back to school any

294
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:53,750
more than any any number of other things

295
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:57,260
developers do right so back to

296
00:10:53,750 --> 00:11:00,450
organizations so the way that software

297
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:03,510
manufacturers organize is we have we

298
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:06,810
have squads or teams of developers with

299
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:08,700
some kind of a unit leader and then we

300
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:11,430
have the management organization

301
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:14,400
so in here I'm going to use this laser

302
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:24,540
pointer cuz it's really cool so the

303
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:26,010
squads of developers so it's all good so

304
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,689
the squads of developers typically roll

305
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:29,340
up into an engineering leader to be a

306
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:31,640
director of engineering or VP of

307
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:33,870
engineering or you know hierarchy and

308
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:36,210
the engineering leader typically rolls

309
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:38,160
up into an EVP and SVP or some very

310
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:40,500
important VP typically rolls up into the

311
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,880
sea level and then there's this another

312
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,370
organization there's a whole nother

313
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:46,470
organizational branch in the tree called

314
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,550
product management when there may be and

315
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:49,140
there may be many of these there may be

316
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:51,930
product managers there may be product

317
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:53,640
line managers product managers director

318
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:54,900
is a product management senior directors

319
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,280
of product management eventually there's

320
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,959
a VP of Product Management

321
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:00,300
there might be an EVP of product

322
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:02,640
management and they roll up into an

323
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:04,890
extra-special VP that has an ear and ass

324
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:08,040
in front of his name and they all roll

325
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:10,740
up into the CEO who is really floating

326
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:12,390
above the details here and then you have

327
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,260
this kind of weird security guy off in

328
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,850
the corner that nobody really

329
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:20,189
understands typically and that's that's

330
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:22,290
me so what is this all about then so

331
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:23,730
this is I - I put this in here because I

332
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:25,310
actually started working on this talk

333
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:27,270
five years ago as I said it's been

334
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:29,760
developing it for a long time working

335
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:31,949
with some advisors and this was this

336
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,830
this was a something I was circulating

337
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:36,840
at the time so I had to throw it in this

338
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:38,760
this by the way this this character here

339
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,620
is actually dr. Strangelove for those of

340
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:43,020
you that haven't seen the film all right

341
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:46,080
so let's agree to dispense with this

342
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:47,520
method out this mythology and what I'm

343
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:50,970
going to argue here today is that it's

344
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:52,710
actually an economic problem and it's an

345
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:54,570
economic problem called a social dilemma

346
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:56,520
which is a game theory concept so if we

347
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:59,430
apply game theory so what it happened is

348
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,880
after um look well let me not get ahead

349
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:02,910
of myself

350
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:05,340
so anybody who's seen the film might

351
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:06,660
remember this this is one of the I don't

352
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:08,040
want to throw out spoilers here but this

353
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,930
is one of the points where the movie

354
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,310
gets really silly at the end instead

355
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:13,439
they start talking it you have to see

356
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:15,300
the film to understand this but the

357
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,360
reason it's in here is let's talk about

358
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:21,510
so this is by the way anybody ever read

359
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,480
an SEC filing like a 10-q where if

360
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:24,220
you're a public company

361
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,199
to do an SEC filing once a quarter once

362
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:28,329
a year I don't know if anybody noticed

363
00:13:26,199 --> 00:13:30,790
this but I only I noticed this myself

364
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:32,589
you when you do an SEC filing you're

365
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:35,680
required to do this disclosure about

366
00:13:32,589 --> 00:13:37,709
Mine Safety disclosures um if you're a

367
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,029
software manufacturer you're required to

368
00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:41,680
just you know to state whether or not

369
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:43,990
you have had mine safety disclosures

370
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,880
everybody's required to do this um I'm

371
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:48,310
not sure why I'm still trying to figure

372
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:52,570
out exactly why but I'm pretty sure the

373
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:55,209
reason is because the history of this is

374
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:57,519
that the with the mining industry had a

375
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:58,630
social dilemma in the earlier if we go

376
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,850
back to the earlier history of

377
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:02,620
capitalism many industries had social

378
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:04,029
dilemmas around safety and the mining

379
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:08,260
industry is one of the first and the

380
00:14:04,029 --> 00:14:10,750
worst examples and so here's the NPR

381
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:12,880
anecdote so driving to New Hampshire to

382
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:14,649
see my older relatives and trying to

383
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,240
answer their questions one day I find

384
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:17,649
myself listening to NPR because there's

385
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,870
not much else on the radio in New

386
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:22,149
Hampshire where they live and I mean I

387
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:24,130
love NPR it's not a dig against them but

388
00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:25,660
so they were doing a story about the

389
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:28,660
early mining industry so if we go back

390
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:30,490
almost two centuries there was an

391
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:33,040
enormous one of the one of the largest

392
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:35,769
highest growth industries and the growth

393
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,540
of the nation was mining where enormous

394
00:14:35,769 --> 00:14:40,449
fortunes were made in very short periods

395
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:43,480
of time and you know mining was you know

396
00:14:40,449 --> 00:14:45,939
was was as big and as important then

397
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:48,130
probably as software and big data and

398
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:49,000
Internet things are today mining was the

399
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:52,689
thing of its day

400
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,360
for a time so what's interesting is that

401
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:57,370
when they arm they decided that there

402
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,560
was no business case for safety because

403
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:02,319
to the primitive business science of the

404
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:04,119
day the early capitalist said well my

405
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:06,010
customers don't buy safety features they

406
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:08,019
buy precious metals therefore there's no

407
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:10,449
business case for safety so I don't care

408
00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:13,000
about safety so because I only make

409
00:15:10,449 --> 00:15:15,160
things that I can sell so we will not

410
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,649
spend time and effort or money on safety

411
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,269
features why because you know my

412
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:22,480
state-of-the-art business science tells

413
00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:24,519
me not to so what happened is the miners

414
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,500
if the miners wanted to have safety

415
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:28,360
features they had to do it themselves on

416
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,860
their break time so if you wanted to

417
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,660
build an air shaft or a tunnel support

418
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:34,600
you could do it on your lunch break but

419
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:36,160
nobody's getting paid for this and you

420
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,590
know if you did this while you're on the

421
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,800
clock

422
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:41,840
be fired so um so of course you know

423
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,459
miners would rig improvised safety

424
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,930
features as best they could which of

425
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,730
course will horribly inadequate and

426
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:49,449
there were terrible accidents and loss

427
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:52,310
of life and then we got into this very

428
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:53,780
almost almost Hobbesian state of affairs

429
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:55,670
where the mining Foreman would get

430
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:57,949
engaged in a sort of a grim calculus of

431
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:59,750
well how much loss of life is acceptable

432
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:02,780
in order to reach my growth numbers and

433
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:05,960
hit my KPIs and and this was considered

434
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:07,540
acceptable in the earlier ages of

435
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:11,710
capitalism at least for a time

436
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:15,020
so eventually things got so bad that

437
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:17,270
miners riot miners would strike and then

438
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:18,710
they'd the mining barons would bring in

439
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:20,360
these private armies that people called

440
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:22,580
Pinkerton guards to break the strikes

441
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,410
and then the miners would riot and there

442
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:26,450
would be conflict and loss of life and

443
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:30,439
and it was it was very violent and and

444
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:32,840
it was incredibly tragic at times and

445
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,850
then it eventually got so bad that the

446
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,470
government had to step in to restore

447
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:40,070
order just to get things under control

448
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:41,240
and so and this one on you know you can

449
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,890
read the history of this it went on for

450
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,350
quite a while so eventually of course

451
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:47,360
today you know today we don't operate

452
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:50,780
mines like this because today we've

453
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:53,720
learned that safe mines are actually

454
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:55,220
more profitable at a higher cost basis

455
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,510
but they're more profitable because the

456
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:59,570
mines are more productive when the

457
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:02,180
miners don't die right but it took a

458
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:04,190
long time for capitalism to learn that

459
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:07,399
and the same is true in other industries

460
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:09,050
so this is our product our project

461
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,060
manager we're going to talk about the

462
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:13,849
product manager in the role of software

463
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:15,200
manufacturers so on anybody know who

464
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:16,399
this character is by the way this is

465
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,860
another character from Doctor Strange

466
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,780
level this is actually a general buck

467
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:24,409
purchasing who is the senior military

468
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:26,839
leader in the room so the product

469
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:29,090
manager we're going to look at some the

470
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:31,040
product managers view of the world and

471
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:32,570
I'm going to do this not because I don't

472
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,340
want us to hate on the product manager

473
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:36,409
just like developers I want us to

474
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:38,060
empathize with a product manager put

475
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:39,590
ourselves in his shoes and learn to see

476
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,850
the world from his point of view because

477
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:42,860
that's what we have to do in order to

478
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:44,959
solve this problem so the product

479
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:48,560
manager is like the mining Baron is a

480
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,830
pure capitalist he looks at he wants to

481
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,049
build things and

482
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:53,879
Meritage things according to revenue

483
00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:55,830
attached he wants to build that which he

484
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,260
can sell because you wanted to make his

485
00:17:55,830 --> 00:18:04,110
kpi's grow revenue valuation stock price

486
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:06,299
etc so it's the product manager is where

487
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:09,178
our bottleneck lies because the product

488
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:10,230
manager in many ways outranks the VP of

489
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:11,700
engineering of the engineering

490
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:13,679
leadership because the product manager

491
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:16,140
is one who decides what we're going to

492
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:19,470
build and he decides that according to

493
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:21,720
revenue attached sales in progress deals

494
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:23,850
on the table etc and according to you

495
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,889
know features and deals that have the

496
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:29,730
most revenue attached in the sales

497
00:18:25,889 --> 00:18:31,559
pipeline and this is not wrong this is

498
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:34,710
capitalism this is business

499
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:36,600
so on this is so how do the product

500
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:38,340
managers see us so this is an actual

501
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,779
this is something I've heard more than

502
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:42,059
one product manager and sales leaders

503
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:44,850
say and and and in a way they're right

504
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:47,639
because again this is not a dig this is

505
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:51,689
more or less fair because as security

506
00:18:47,639 --> 00:18:53,340
teams as software buyers found as you

507
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:55,049
know security teams tasked with managing

508
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:57,209
risk in a supply chain and reviewing

509
00:18:55,049 --> 00:18:59,429
software purchases we typically don't

510
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:02,700
have the budget and ability to say yeah

511
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:04,320
we will you know we'll pay two percent

512
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,090
more if you'll tack on these security

513
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,200
features we typically security teams

514
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:09,389
typically have the ability to say no

515
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,460
that's unacceptable risk but they don't

516
00:19:09,389 --> 00:19:13,350
typically have the ability to say yes we

517
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:15,029
need this feature and by the way we'll

518
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:18,029
will kick in a little bit of extra

519
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:21,539
revenue for it um this is another quote

520
00:19:18,029 --> 00:19:23,070
so um when prioritizing so from a

521
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:25,440
security perform a product managers

522
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:27,928
perspective all features are equal there

523
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,320
are no sacred cows because they're

524
00:19:27,929 --> 00:19:32,549
capitalists any feature may be

525
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,980
arbitrarily raised or lowered in

526
00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:36,929
priority at any time according to the

527
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:39,690
revenue attached and the business

528
00:19:36,929 --> 00:19:41,070
benefit that it brings so you know when

529
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:42,389
you go to product manager and we say

530
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:45,389
well we must have two-factor

531
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:46,979
authentication immediately this is just

532
00:19:45,389 --> 00:19:48,719
one example reaction is you know none of

533
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:51,809
his customers are going to none of his

534
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,399
customers who are business leaders are

535
00:19:51,809 --> 00:19:55,830
going to come to him and say I love that

536
00:19:53,399 --> 00:19:57,570
you have to factor auth now shut up and

537
00:19:55,830 --> 00:20:00,090
take my money right that is never going

538
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:03,360
to happen so from his perspective it's a

539
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:05,399
low priority feature not because it's

540
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,080
security but because it's just one of

541
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:10,049
hundreds of low priority features that

542
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:12,290
have no incremental revenue attached all

543
00:20:10,049 --> 00:20:15,920
right so here's another paraphrase and

544
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:18,389
this is on this is a paraphrase from a

545
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,860
software it's actually more of an

546
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:23,190
engineering lead than a product manager

547
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:24,360
but this is you know more or less how it

548
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:28,049
looks from the other side of the table

549
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:30,209
so and and in this case this particular

550
00:20:28,049 --> 00:20:32,549
individual had a really good point

551
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:34,799
because this is the case where they were

552
00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:37,020
already 1/3 of a way into their project

553
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,610
trying to ship a new product they had

554
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:40,350
already had their resources and their

555
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:42,330
their headcount had already been cut

556
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:44,399
their budgets have been cut their

557
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:46,379
timetable had been accelerated they're

558
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,120
on a death march already trying to ship

559
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:50,220
this thing on time to satisfy their

560
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,780
masters and then they get all a bunch of

561
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:54,210
security requirements dropped on them

562
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:56,220
after this process that they had no idea

563
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:57,960
we're coming and so basically and you

564
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,760
know if you think about it if this

565
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,919
weren't security if somebody did this to

566
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,419
us with an on security feature well most

567
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,630
of us would probably act the same way if

568
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:08,040
you want us to do twice to work with 25

569
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:09,630
percent less people and you're

570
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:11,820
increasing my deadlines and you're

571
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:14,220
giving me no new resources well how is

572
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:15,780
that fair well you know it isn't most

573
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:20,760
the time it really isn't fair so why do

574
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:25,110
we do that so here's this is the heart

575
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:29,669
of the dilemma so there is a convention

576
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:31,290
that safety is free so when you look at

577
00:21:29,669 --> 00:21:33,990
conversations between software

578
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:35,850
manufacturers and software buyers most

579
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:38,010
software buyers say I do not pay for

580
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:40,139
safety because safety is free either

581
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:42,390
because it's an aspect of quality or its

582
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,919
cultural mori that safety is free I do

583
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:45,690
not pay for safety I do not pay for

584
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:47,610
security I get that for free you need to

585
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:49,460
give that to me software manufacturers

586
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:53,189
look at and say well you know you've got

587
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:55,169
12 or 24 pages of security requirements

588
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:57,540
in the contract and some of those things

589
00:21:55,169 --> 00:22:00,470
are big-ticket items that have millions

590
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:03,600
of dollars in cost attached and you know

591
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:05,580
work isn't free and software isn't you

592
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,730
know things are not free that isn't fair

593
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:10,320
so in a way where they who is writing

594
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:14,580
and who is wrong I'm not here to answer

595
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:17,439
that I'm not here to solve this I'm here

596
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:19,240
to explore the problem so

597
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,980
I want to talk about my focus here is

598
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,899
not so much on what should they be doing

599
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:27,309
it's more about what is actually

600
00:22:22,899 --> 00:22:29,018
happening today so a social dilemma so I

601
00:22:27,309 --> 00:22:30,850
had to go back and study game theory and

602
00:22:29,019 --> 00:22:33,669
game theory is really complex so I had

603
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:36,309
some advisors on this to help me and I'm

604
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:39,190
no expert by any means but game in game

605
00:22:36,309 --> 00:22:41,710
theory a social dilemma is where both

606
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:43,779
parties choose to act in rational

607
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:46,480
self-interest but this creates a bad

608
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:49,450
outcome for all it's a very interesting

609
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,009
paradox so in this case it's a social

610
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:53,110
dilemma because both parties choose the

611
00:22:51,009 --> 00:22:54,940
selfish option which is not to pay for

612
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:57,340
secure it for better software security

613
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:59,110
and then what we get is we get worse

614
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:00,840
software security which is a bad outcome

615
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:07,840
for all which is not the outcome we want

616
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:10,750
but that's what we get so it's a

617
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,850
situation where individuals think

618
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:14,590
they'll profit from selfishness unless

619
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:16,840
everyone chooses the selfish alternative

620
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:19,120
in which case the whole group loses and

621
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,799
and they they get worse outcomes and

622
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,299
they want too many group members choose

623
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:24,908
to pursue individual profit and

624
00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:28,440
immediate satisfaction which is rational

625
00:23:24,909 --> 00:23:31,389
if you're thinking as an individual but

626
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:33,909
thinking as a member of a group system

627
00:23:31,389 --> 00:23:38,799
it's actually not rational so this is

628
00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:39,610
something so I'm in game theory um most

629
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,350
of us are probably heard of the

630
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:44,370
prisoner's dilemma it's probably the

631
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:47,620
most cited game theory problem example I

632
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:49,149
believe that the stag hunt model is

633
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:51,158
actually what we're talking about here

634
00:23:49,149 --> 00:23:54,518
and this is this is something that is a

635
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:57,700
little bit less known but the stag hunt

636
00:23:54,519 --> 00:24:00,759
the stag hunt game means that there are

637
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:02,500
two or more parties to a hunt so we're

638
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:04,000
out in our hunting clothes and horses

639
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:06,850
and we're hunting you know with we've

640
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,610
got pounds and we're hunting for things

641
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:12,879
so if the if the parties to the hunt

642
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:14,740
cooperate they get a stag which a stag

643
00:24:12,879 --> 00:24:16,809
is just I think it's just another name

644
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:17,919
for a deer I think is some of this game

645
00:24:16,809 --> 00:24:20,559
theory was stuff was written a long time

646
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:22,509
ago so if the parties cooperate they get

647
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:24,428
a stag which is a lot of food so we get

648
00:24:22,509 --> 00:24:26,320
to eat for like a week that's great

649
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:29,529
everyone's happy if the parties don't

650
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:31,220
cooperate then then each individual

651
00:24:29,529 --> 00:24:33,650
party gets a hare

652
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:35,390
which a hair is a word for a rabbit so a

653
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:37,070
rabbit is a little bit of food so you

654
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:39,230
get maybe like one meal and then you're

655
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:41,629
hungry the rest of the day so if you

656
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:43,640
cooperate you get a lot of food really

657
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:45,530
good outcome game theories are measured

658
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:48,260
in rewards of measuring what's called

659
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:50,930
utils so if you cooperate everybody gets

660
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:53,000
many utils if you if they don't

661
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:55,370
cooperate they get one you tell which is

662
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,430
a small amount of food so in the

663
00:24:55,370 --> 00:25:00,739
software world if we switch from a stag

664
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:04,370
hunt to a security hunt this is what it

665
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:06,310
looks like so if the software

666
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:09,739
manufacturers and the software buyers

667
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:12,260
cooperate we get much much stronger

668
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:13,610
software security agree and I'm not

669
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:15,740
going to say we get software security

670
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:17,629
because that's another question but we

671
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:19,970
get better software security relative to

672
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:21,770
what we have now and I know if you can

673
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:23,840
do this because I've done this myself so

674
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:26,210
I know it can be done it's not easy but

675
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:29,449
it can be done um if they don't

676
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:32,390
cooperate then we get relatively weaker

677
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:34,100
security which is what we have now so

678
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:36,020
caught what does cooperate mean so

679
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:38,179
cooperate means for the software

680
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:40,610
manufacturer the product manager decides

681
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:42,980
to increase investment of resources and

682
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:45,199
time for security features meaning they

683
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:46,880
raise priority of security features they

684
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,110
take them out of the backlog they put

685
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,350
them in a sprint and they make them

686
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:54,770
first-class features and you know which

687
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:56,330
means rather than just having a security

688
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:58,010
sprint occasionally here there we're

689
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:59,290
talking about many security Sprint's

690
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:02,030
with like you're not doing much more

691
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:04,760
engineering on security for the software

692
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:09,440
rings the software buyer cooperation

693
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:11,810
means invest by paying higher prices a

694
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,280
grant it doesn't mean like we're not

695
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:15,409
talking about necessarily doubling or

696
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:17,450
tripling the price of software but there

697
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:19,190
needs to be an incremental if we're

698
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:20,870
going to be building you know software

699
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:22,400
features that are very expensive there

700
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:24,709
has to be an incremental increase in

701
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,930
prices because this is business

702
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:29,690
so if both parties cooperate and they

703
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:31,520
invest we would get much stronger we

704
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:33,380
would get relatively stronger software

705
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,360
security if the parties don't cooperate

706
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:40,120
we get weaker software security which is

707
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:42,429
what we have today makes sense so

708
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,899
so where do we go then so this leads

709
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:45,160
directly into the regulation debate

710
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:48,040
which is the conversation I was having

711
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:52,780
with that the DHS minister of software

712
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:54,790
guy five years ago so let me preface

713
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:57,670
this by saying I'm actually not here

714
00:26:54,790 --> 00:27:00,370
today to try and sell you a regulation

715
00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:03,490
scheme because I don't think there is a

716
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:04,719
winner amongst the regulation ideas that

717
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:06,610
are competing in the marketplace of

718
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,900
ideas there's not a consensus and I

719
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:10,120
don't think there is a clear winner but

720
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:11,620
the fact that there isn't the fact that

721
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:13,479
we don't know what to do about this is

722
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:15,280
really interesting so I'm going to

723
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:17,260
propose I'm going to explore two options

724
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:20,170
here one of which is regulation I'm

725
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:23,470
going to propose on a private sector

726
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:25,150
solution that is going to be probably a

727
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:27,040
little bit controversial and may even

728
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:28,360
upset some people but I just let me just

729
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:30,460
purchase this by saying that I'm not

730
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:32,590
advocating we do this I'm exploring what

731
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:34,360
the options look like finally I do

732
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:37,840
actually have a concrete recommendation

733
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:41,679
to make so the regulation debate has

734
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:43,990
been going on for at least six years

735
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:46,930
remember seeing a panel debate this at

736
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:48,760
RSA 2011 and it's been debated for me

737
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:50,620
now maybe closer to a decade and there

738
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:52,120
are strong proponents on both sides so

739
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:53,979
what does regulation means so regulation

740
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,959
itself can mean a lot of things it can

741
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:58,570
mean government regulation of the

742
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:00,700
software security quality it could mean

743
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:02,740
a market-based approach that isn't it's

744
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:05,080
not a private sector approach which has

745
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:07,900
significant problems of its own and then

746
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:10,300
finally on the faith-based solution

747
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:11,620
anybody this is a term where I don't

748
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:14,169
find anybody remembers but during the

749
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:15,550
the Bush administration's both Bush

750
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:16,480
junior and senior sometimes you hear

751
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:18,430
people talk about what we need

752
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:21,340
faith-based solutions as an approach to

753
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:22,990
as an alternative to more government so

754
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:27,189
I'm going to actually explore what that

755
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:28,780
looks like as well so what does

756
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:31,300
regulation mean so one definition of

757
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:32,860
regulation is if you talk to there a

758
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:34,840
number of parties to this if you talk to

759
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:36,370
them to say yes we need regulation we

760
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:38,709
need to regulate software security

761
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:40,780
research and make it stop and we need to

762
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:43,600
do that immediately so that's one point

763
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:46,240
of view on that obviously just hides the

764
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,620
problem it's not a solution then there's

765
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,320
another camp that says well we need to

766
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:52,540
regulate the supply of software security

767
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,530
bugs but through economic incentives

768
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:56,190
either through law

769
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:57,940
and standards and bureaucracy or

770
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:59,230
possibly through a private sector

771
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:01,930
solution which I'll show you what the

772
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:03,580
heck that looks like so you know this is

773
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:05,560
kind of we kind of get stuck in this

774
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:08,379
mode today where we have people saying

775
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:09,280
yes yes we need regulation as in you

776
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:11,260
know make it stop

777
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:13,210
just make make everybody stop publishing

778
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:14,470
bugs and breaking all the things because

779
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:17,200
if you would just stop publishing the

780
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:19,000
bugs then I could quiet the noise and I

781
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,230
could get back to building the products

782
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,420
would I want to build that I can sell

783
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:25,510
and you know so this is a very

784
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:28,440
short-sighted kind of non solution but

785
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:31,120
we do kind of tend to get stuck here and

786
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:33,100
you know there's been over the years of

787
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:35,260
course there's been enormous discourse

788
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:37,379
on this issue on Twitter

789
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:40,990
obviously most security researchers

790
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:44,110
argue that that criminalizing security

791
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:46,630
regulation or legalizing it is is you

792
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:48,219
know not the answer but this

793
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:49,690
conversation you know the fact that this

794
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:52,120
conversation is still going on just

795
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:55,330
proves that we are still very much

796
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:57,219
learning about the problem some people

797
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:58,840
this isn't it this is one actually EULA

798
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:01,120
this is a Euler from a commercial

799
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:03,669
software product that is thought to

800
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,320
discourage security research I've heard

801
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:06,790
them a number of researchers tell me

802
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,530
that they don't do research in this

803
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:10,149
product because of this EULA and because

804
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:12,100
of the legal departments so aggressive

805
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:13,810
and then their end result is what we see

806
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:15,429
is that a lot of the research and I'm

807
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:17,470
not going to name this product because I

808
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:20,140
haven't been provided a lawyer for this

809
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:21,700
talk but it's also not important what

810
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:23,320
product this is you know the point is

811
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,880
that what happens here is that a lot of

812
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:27,580
the security research on this product

813
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,440
comes from places like Russia which you

814
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:31,120
know if you ever tried to do if you ever

815
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,800
tried to work with law enforcement or

816
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,360
sue somebody in Russia you find out that

817
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,980
you know Russian legal authorities can't

818
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:38,229
cooperate with themselves never mind

819
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:39,820
anybody else right so you are not going

820
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:43,090
to sue security researchers in Russia

821
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:44,950
and get anywhere so you know moving it

822
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:47,379
to nations moving it into the gray

823
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:51,970
market areas is obviously probably not a

824
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:53,770
better outcome for us um there have been

825
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:55,150
things like the Wassenaar agreement

826
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:59,370
changes to the Computer Fraud and Abuse

827
00:30:55,150 --> 00:31:02,080
Act most of this I think is made by I

828
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:03,879
think the real problem here is that the

829
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:06,020
law makers who are working on this stuff

830
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:08,390
really need a lot more

831
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:10,429
help from the technology community and

832
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:12,590
understandings issues framing the debate

833
00:31:10,429 --> 00:31:14,299
and trying to figure out a workable

834
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:16,309
approach and that's on us I think we

835
00:31:14,299 --> 00:31:19,309
need to help them so if you look at poor

836
00:31:16,309 --> 00:31:21,230
regulation arguments I don't think with

837
00:31:19,309 --> 00:31:23,450
RSA 2011 but there was a heated debate

838
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:25,039
they are in a panel Bruce Schneier said

839
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:26,270
that yes we need to regulate software

840
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:29,000
because what we have today is like

841
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:30,950
consumers testing their own food right

842
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:35,120
which doesn't make any sense it's like

843
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:36,740
the food industry in God you know 19 you

844
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,479
know a century ago in the food industry

845
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:39,950
they had serious safety problems and

846
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,890
people would actually die from eating

847
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:46,059
food on a regular basis and there was

848
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:49,760
another social dilemma so um

849
00:31:46,059 --> 00:31:52,990
opponents will say yes there is a

850
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:55,669
problem but regulation is has too many

851
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:59,830
too many unsolved issues to be sorted

852
00:31:55,669 --> 00:32:01,760
out and in fairness there are some so

853
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:04,460
proponents will also point to the fact

854
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:06,860
that other other industries have had

855
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:08,090
social dilemmas around safety that none

856
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:10,729
of which could be solved from within

857
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:13,158
they all required external regulation by

858
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:16,100
government or by the state and software

859
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:18,529
is no different they will argue that

860
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:22,250
this is only only external economic

861
00:32:18,529 --> 00:32:24,350
forces can affect this this is one of my

862
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:27,500
favorite quotes enough anybody saw this

863
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:30,439
from this was black cat two years ago I

864
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:33,169
think and you know software has never

865
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:34,700
been subject to liability for various

866
00:32:33,169 --> 00:32:36,980
reasons that are too dense to go into

867
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:38,630
here and so obviously there there is no

868
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:39,799
reliability touch to software and

869
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:42,470
there's no liability attached to

870
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:44,629
software security so the

871
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:46,429
counter-arguments the major argument

872
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:48,140
here is that nobody knows how to

873
00:32:46,429 --> 00:32:49,880
regulate software security like how do

874
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:51,250
we actually do that well the truth is

875
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:53,929
nobody really knows

876
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:56,120
so the counter-argument from the

877
00:32:53,929 --> 00:32:57,799
software lobby is well you know first of

878
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:59,570
all we already self-regulate and that's

879
00:32:57,799 --> 00:33:01,580
working fine but if you field regulate

880
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:03,279
researchers as in make them stop that'd

881
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:05,960
be great we'd like you to do that right

882
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:07,580
then the next argument is well there is

883
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,590
no actionable plan here they would argue

884
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:10,460
that we don't have that the software

885
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:12,770
I'll go say we don't have the

886
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:14,899
manufacturing science to make perfectly

887
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:16,789
reliable software we don't even know how

888
00:33:14,899 --> 00:33:19,350
to do that much less make software that

889
00:33:16,789 --> 00:33:22,140
is demonstrably secure and

890
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:23,370
to be secure to what standard because we

891
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:26,610
don't know how to make software that is

892
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:28,320
secure a period and then if you push

893
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:29,459
them far enough you'll start hearing

894
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:33,330
about what's sometimes called the

895
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:35,490
nuclear option and what that means is if

896
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:36,539
you really push for this you'll start to

897
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:37,980
hear things like well if you're going to

898
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:40,770
regulate software we're going offshore

899
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:42,750
we're not coming back and so you know

900
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:44,490
all those high-paying tech jobs in your

901
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:47,010
district senator you can say goodbye to

902
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:49,380
and good luck so you know obviously

903
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:50,940
nobody wants to talk now is this a real

904
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:52,169
threat or an empty threat well nobody

905
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:55,590
really knows but nobody wants to find

906
00:33:52,169 --> 00:33:57,210
out so the other the reason that there's

907
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:58,830
no way forward here is because by the

908
00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:00,960
way this is used by permission from a

909
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:03,570
really great Ola spraining class called

910
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,669
practical web application pentesting by

911
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:07,500
tim tomes and i'm going to include a

912
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:09,810
link to him and the acknowledgments that

913
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:11,280
i'll put in the blog post for you but

914
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:13,859
basically this is this is the short

915
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,230
answer of why can't we why isn't there a

916
00:34:13,859 --> 00:34:17,909
way for it well because static and

917
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:19,679
dynamic analysis tools are great at

918
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:21,600
finding bugs and they're useful but a

919
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:23,070
lot of the really serious security flaws

920
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:26,040
that we find still come out of manual

921
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:27,720
testing this is slow it's expensive it

922
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:29,790
requires very specialized knowledge

923
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:30,928
there are only a few thousand people in

924
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:33,300
the world that are really good at this

925
00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:39,300
probably less than 10,000 so this is

926
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:41,490
slow and it's hard to scale so we get

927
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:42,720
into this problem it's like okay well

928
00:34:41,489 --> 00:34:47,520
let's declare software security

929
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:50,388
regulation okay and so then what like

930
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:52,859
what is that what what standard do we

931
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:54,929
engineer to you know first of all you

932
00:34:52,859 --> 00:34:57,600
know the first problem is is nobody can

933
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:59,790
agree on what the standard should be for

934
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:02,100
software security or you know can we

935
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:04,109
attach a liability to that there's no

936
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:08,100
consensus on this and there's there's no

937
00:35:04,109 --> 00:35:10,049
consensus in sight so um this is a very

938
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:11,400
snarky comment I made when on Twitter

939
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:12,960
and you know this is another cot that

940
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,430
software security debate has been taking

941
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,050
place on Twitter for a long time

942
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:18,210
you know I made this comment is you know

943
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:20,940
if we do declare software security if we

944
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:22,680
you know if if we just declare yes you

945
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:24,930
shall make your software secure or else

946
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:27,569
and we put some agency in charge of that

947
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:29,700
and probably probably what happens is

948
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:31,050
that nobody then knows whether they can

949
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,399
ship anything or not and so now we're

950
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:33,920
perfectly secure because there is no

951
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:37,080
software

952
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:39,720
right so the other counter regulation is

953
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:42,290
that the first counter-argument you get

954
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:46,290
is that self-regulation is working and

955
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:48,600
you know I think we can agree that given

956
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:49,680
the kind of security disasters that we

957
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:52,710
see it's pretty clear that

958
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:55,109
self-regulation is it may be doing some

959
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:56,610
good but it's not going to move the

960
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:58,740
metrics and it's not going to solve the

961
00:35:56,610 --> 00:36:00,630
problem any more than self regulation

962
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:06,930
could solve social dilemmas around

963
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:08,190
safety and other industries so software

964
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:10,020
manufacturers will argue though that

965
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:13,890
self regulation is effective it's

966
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:16,110
optimal and it's working and the point

967
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:17,520
of things like well we have processes we

968
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:19,170
have you know dashboards product

969
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,330
managers we have you know we do a pen

970
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:24,900
test once a year and then we you know

971
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:26,910
put that in a backlog there's an

972
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:28,260
increasing trend towards bug bounties

973
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:31,259
and I think bird bindings are very

974
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:33,210
promising in terms of making pen testing

975
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:35,400
and security research more accessible to

976
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:36,960
lots more organizations but you know

977
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,670
again the bug bunnies most of the time

978
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,890
we're testing things after they've been

979
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:42,630
released and they've been shipped and so

980
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:44,129
you know if you're finding lots of

981
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:45,600
security flies after products been

982
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:47,880
shipped those may or may not get fixed

983
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:50,670
you're also not going to find things

984
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:52,260
like design flaws typically in a bug

985
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:54,630
bounty you're probably not going to find

986
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:57,240
design flaws or logic errors or other

987
00:36:54,630 --> 00:37:00,060
serious issues that would not typically

988
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:01,890
be found by a pen tester coming in on a

989
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:03,180
black box model so they're those are

990
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:05,180
really useful but I don't think that

991
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:08,370
those are going to save us

992
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:09,779
so the pro regulars will say yes you

993
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:11,819
know you're dead bunnies in your process

994
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:13,620
is good but this is only as

995
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:15,690
sophisticated as your customer Scruton

996
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:17,700
demands and the software buyers lack the

997
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:20,160
sophistication to really measure

998
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:22,109
software product quality is one they

999
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,270
don't have access to your product source

1000
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:25,620
trees and your backlogs and threat

1001
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:26,970
models and they simply don't have what

1002
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:29,910
they need to do a meaningful assessment

1003
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:31,980
they can't and to the customers you know

1004
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:33,720
the software buyers that are going and

1005
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:36,660
buying a two-week pen test and pointing

1006
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:38,189
that at you that is informative but a

1007
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:41,970
two-week pen test looking for things

1008
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:43,530
like sequel and XSS is not really it

1009
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:45,569
doesn't really go deep enough to make a

1010
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:46,230
real judgment about software security

1011
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:50,550
quality

1012
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:52,800
so of course the nuclear option exists

1013
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:54,750
that if you regulate software the entire

1014
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,250
software industry is going offshore and

1015
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:58,079
the software industry will kind of get

1016
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:59,550
together and they'll buy the an island

1017
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:01,680
and I'll call it software land and

1018
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:03,060
they'll move everything there and this

1019
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,250
is probably an empty threat because

1020
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:07,290
these software software manufacturers

1021
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:08,940
are not going to abandon the major

1022
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:11,070
markets that are talking about

1023
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:13,109
regulation so this is probably an empty

1024
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:14,430
threat but nobody wants to find out

1025
00:38:13,109 --> 00:38:16,740
obviously we don't want to go there

1026
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:19,770
so just like about a private sector

1027
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:21,750
solution so what would it look like what

1028
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:27,540
would an alternative to government

1029
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:29,099
regulation look like well I don't know

1030
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:30,359
if people realize how many people

1031
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:32,670
realize this but there actually are

1032
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:35,848
exploit exchanges operating today that

1033
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:40,380
have been for years and these are kind

1034
00:38:35,849 --> 00:38:42,150
of unofficial semi secretive exchanges

1035
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:46,109
where exploits are bought and sold by

1036
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:48,119
exploit brokers now we can't see any of

1037
00:38:46,109 --> 00:38:50,910
that today because it's all very it's

1038
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:52,710
very invisible to us but if you I

1039
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:54,390
actually interviewed the CEO of an

1040
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:55,650
exploit brokerage and and looked at this

1041
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:56,879
and the course of developing this talk

1042
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:58,710
and if you do that it gets really

1043
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,319
interesting because there's a lot of

1044
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:03,150
data in there that we could make a lot

1045
00:39:01,319 --> 00:39:06,000
of derivation from if we could see it

1046
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:08,069
but we can't so so first off the first

1047
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,170
question though is can we make

1048
00:39:08,069 --> 00:39:12,630
derivations about product security

1049
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:14,550
quality from equity training data that

1050
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:17,160
we already have like stock price well

1051
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:18,599
let's look at that so here is a company

1052
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,750
this is one of the most prolific

1053
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:24,119
software manufacturers tried it over

1054
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:27,270
approximately 20 years this is this is

1055
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:29,670
stock price this is volume and these are

1056
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:32,310
these are the weird metrics that the

1057
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:33,450
analyst on CNBC talked about so I dine

1058
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:35,520
this way because I started learning

1059
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:37,828
about I started learning about finance

1060
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:40,079
and stuff about four years ago and how I

1061
00:39:37,829 --> 00:39:40,950
got into these ideas so I anybody want

1062
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:44,369
to guess who this is

1063
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:47,040
there's right this is 1994 I made this

1064
00:39:44,369 --> 00:39:51,780
chart a while back so it ends on more

1065
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:54,060
than a year ago but it is Microsoft so

1066
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:56,369
you know if you look at this

1067
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:57,589
Microsoft kind of invented what we call

1068
00:39:56,369 --> 00:39:59,790
the security development lifecycle

1069
00:39:57,589 --> 00:40:03,390
somewhere in here

1070
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:05,609
and then we went sideways for a while so

1071
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:07,950
if you're a if you're an MBA from

1072
00:40:05,609 --> 00:40:09,150
Harvard or a Wharton or someplace and

1073
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:10,859
you're looking at that and saying well

1074
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:12,990
where's the security list where's the

1075
00:40:10,859 --> 00:40:16,230
security bounce it's really unclear

1076
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:18,000
where it is here's another one another

1077
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:20,430
prolific software and hardware

1078
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,250
manufacturer one of the most prolific in

1079
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:25,970
history charted again over approximately

1080
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:30,270
20 years anyway let me recognize this

1081
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:32,189
this is apple an apple you know if

1082
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:34,230
people argue about whether Apple has an

1083
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:36,350
SPL I mean they clearly they have a

1084
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:40,080
significant security engineering process

1085
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:42,779
but no they haven't they haven't been as

1086
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:46,049
you know doing as many STL like things

1087
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:47,580
and SQL evangelism say Microsoft but I

1088
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:49,080
mean look at them you know without a net

1089
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:51,180
they don't have an STL and look they've

1090
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:53,160
gone to the moon so you know where's

1091
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:56,640
this where's the security

1092
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:58,740
you know downside there in fairness

1093
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,629
Apple actually has a really good

1094
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:02,609
security practice as well see in a

1095
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:05,130
moment this is another software

1096
00:41:02,609 --> 00:41:08,549
manufacturer that had a serious data

1097
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:13,130
breach about four years ago right about

1098
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:15,540
here and buddy anybody recognize this

1099
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:18,570
this is a public record breach obviously

1100
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:20,369
that we've all heard of no it's not

1101
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:22,410
target it's actually a software it's a

1102
00:41:20,369 --> 00:41:25,050
software it's actually a security

1103
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:26,850
product manufacturer sorry I said so

1104
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:28,230
obviously had to breach here and they

1105
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:32,220
definitely it definitely had an effect

1106
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:34,859
it you know cut them by a third but

1107
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:37,200
they've since recovered and in fact it's

1108
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:41,790
the in fact they've since recovered and

1109
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:44,549
gone on to all-time highs so anything

1110
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:47,390
any exploit exchanges let's power

1111
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:51,570
through this so we know that there are

1112
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:53,990
very very large scale buying and selling

1113
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:57,119
of exploits going on in the in the

1114
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:59,250
secret markets and so this is actually

1115
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:01,740
pricing data from a few years ago that

1116
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:03,570
the CEO of an exploit brokerage provided

1117
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:04,770
to the media and int interesting that

1118
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:06,750
you can see there's a wide range of

1119
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:09,080
pricing starting at about five K and

1120
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:11,430
ranging up to a quarter million and

1121
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:13,440
what's interesting about this is is this

1122
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:15,868
sort of meshes with

1123
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:18,150
my expectations as somebody who's been

1124
00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:21,210
in the trenches for a long time in terms

1125
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:23,550
of where do we see more or fewer

1126
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:26,910
exploits relatively you know Microsoft

1127
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:28,500
is it's gotten has become a much harder

1128
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:31,680
target over the course of the decade

1129
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:33,660
some of these other things are still

1130
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,430
relatively exploitative relatively

1131
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:37,618
expensive and then things like iOS is

1132
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:39,990
has consistently been a very hard target

1133
00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:43,560
and if we look at this is more recent

1134
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:45,359
data where we see there's a range here

1135
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:47,700
now the price range is higher we're

1136
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:50,098
ranging between 10,000 and 1.5 million

1137
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:52,828
the street price for a remote route

1138
00:42:50,099 --> 00:42:54,619
exploit for Apple iOS is well into the

1139
00:42:52,829 --> 00:43:01,170
millions now which is amazing and so

1140
00:42:54,619 --> 00:43:02,910
when I look at this I see it we can sort

1141
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:08,970
of derive that there our supply and

1142
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:11,609
demand zones here so what if we allowed

1143
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:13,109
again this is a controversial idea and

1144
00:43:11,609 --> 00:43:15,119
I'm not proposing we do this but I mean

1145
00:43:13,109 --> 00:43:16,730
this is what I want to explore what a

1146
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:19,740
private sector solution would look like

1147
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:21,930
what if we opened up these you know what

1148
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:23,368
if we closed the dark markets and we

1149
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:25,560
move them into the public domain and

1150
00:43:23,369 --> 00:43:27,960
said trade exploits on the Chicago

1151
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:33,240
Mercantile Exchange like commodities

1152
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:35,220
well commodities are all public data is

1153
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:36,930
where we can see price we can see volume

1154
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:39,509
and we can see dozens of other metrics

1155
00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:43,828
which few of us understand but they

1156
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:46,589
talked about on CNBC all day so looking

1157
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:49,829
at that if we look at things like price

1158
00:43:46,589 --> 00:43:52,170
and volume for software exploits then

1159
00:43:49,829 --> 00:43:54,119
the analyst could make simple

1160
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:56,010
derivations about product security

1161
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:58,079
quality because if you're in a demand

1162
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:59,970
zone and an exploit cost millions you're

1163
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,500
probably doing a relatively better job

1164
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:03,299
on security than something where an

1165
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:05,730
exploit cost five or ten thousand and

1166
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:09,140
they're in a supply zone now there there

1167
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:09,140
are some problems with that to work out

1168
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:14,339
for example the first problem is if you

1169
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:15,810
ask the product manager if there's any

1170
00:44:14,339 --> 00:44:19,049
idea they hate more than software

1171
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:20,670
security regulation they'd say no with

1172
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:22,200
the possible exception of this if you

1173
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:24,150
ask them would you mind if we trade

1174
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:26,220
yours your software vulnerability

1175
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:28,120
exploits on the commodity exchange and

1176
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:30,950
you probably get this

1177
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:32,540
so this is not you know this is pretty

1178
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:36,109
much a non-starter but an interesting

1179
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:37,880
idea so first off we probably can make

1180
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:39,140
derivation problem we can make

1181
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:41,920
derivations about software security

1182
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:44,509
quality there is the problem that

1183
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:47,180
exploits are intangible goods you know

1184
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:50,120
there really isn't a way to stop you

1185
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:51,680
know you from to stop me from copying my

1186
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:54,380
exploit and giving it to all of you for

1187
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:55,819
free that's a hard problem things like

1188
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:58,250
you know intangible commodities like

1189
00:44:55,820 --> 00:45:00,710
futures those are also intangible but

1190
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:03,230
those exist in a server in the ledger in

1191
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:05,390
a server in a brokerage somewhere and so

1192
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:07,160
I can't just copy that you know give it

1193
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:08,540
to all of you because it you know the

1194
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:10,310
state exists in a place that's

1195
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:12,230
controlled and like software there's

1196
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:14,590
also the problem that demand for a

1197
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:17,060
particular exploit may briefly spike

1198
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:19,550
astronomically if the military says well

1199
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:22,580
I need to get that I need to pop that

1200
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:23,900
computer right now you know I don't and

1201
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:26,150
I don't care what it costs give me an

1202
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:29,480
exploit for this then demand may there

1203
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:30,800
may be transient spikes in demand we can

1204
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:32,630
solve this with something called open

1205
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,010
interest because the commodity exchange

1206
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:36,290
published open interest which is the

1207
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:38,780
number of contracts outstanding so if we

1208
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:41,000
see that there's a huge spike in price

1209
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:42,860
but there's a there's no increase in

1210
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,930
open interest or you know open interest

1211
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:46,880
increased by one or two and we can

1212
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:48,710
assume that it's unofficial spike the

1213
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,630
other problem is intangibility now how

1214
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:52,040
do we stop people from copying exploits

1215
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:53,660
and giving them way there's also the

1216
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:57,200
problem that we're selling exploits

1217
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:59,089
which you know as as we can agree from

1218
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:01,189
the news today well we have zero day

1219
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:03,800
exploits we have very serious zero day

1220
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:05,990
exploits in circulation right now which

1221
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:08,770
are being used to do great harm across

1222
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:12,379
the world you know selling exploits

1223
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:14,330
publicly is as a problem the bigger

1224
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:16,310
problem is that the major customers for

1225
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:17,779
the exploit brokerages are governments

1226
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:20,180
their governments and sovereign

1227
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:22,280
militaries and they are not interested

1228
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:24,140
in a public exploit exchange they're

1229
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:25,790
interested in a private one where these

1230
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:27,529
things remain secret because when they

1231
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:30,830
become public their value tends to

1232
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:33,860
evaporate so even if we even as Congress

1233
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:35,960
declared that exploits will now be sold

1234
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:37,280
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange the

1235
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,630
feedback I've been given is that the

1236
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,040
government's the military's would ignore

1237
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:40,640
that and they would still buy these

1238
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,560
things

1239
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:44,720
in the underground or the private

1240
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,130
exchanges and even if Congress outlaws

1241
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:48,080
that they'll still do it because they

1242
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:50,380
can go and get what's called an oh you I

1243
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:52,250
which is an a no you I stands for

1244
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:53,240
actually stands for I don't know what it

1245
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:54,710
stands for but an oh you eye is

1246
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:58,370
basically like a permission slip to go

1247
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:59,650
and do something illegal that you need

1248
00:46:58,370 --> 00:47:01,970
to do for reasons of national security

1249
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:04,040
so that's what I've been told now the

1250
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:05,779
other problem is who so if the

1251
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:08,320
governments are participating in the

1252
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:10,970
brokerage then who are the customers yes

1253
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:14,330
all right so we have to wrap up the

1254
00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:15,859
problem here is that it you know

1255
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:17,779
governments are sort of legitimate

1256
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:19,580
customers for weapons and things like

1257
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:21,680
well we can debate whether they are

1258
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:23,779
whether that is legitimate or not but

1259
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:25,370
the state has jurisdiction on the use of

1260
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:26,780
force so they kind of have the right to

1261
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:27,980
buying these weapons but if the

1262
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:29,560
governments aren't the customers here

1263
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:32,060
then who are the customers and what

1264
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:33,350
legitimate use do they have to be buying

1265
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:35,420
exploits so we probably have

1266
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:38,870
unacceptable moral hazard here which is

1267
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:40,970
completely unworkable so finally I'll

1268
00:47:38,870 --> 00:47:43,430
leave you with this um if we decide that

1269
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:45,200
we need a faith-based solution I would

1270
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:48,529
argue that the faith-based solution is

1271
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:51,200
what we have today that we don't apply

1272
00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:53,780
policy or economic forces in a way that

1273
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:56,149
drives change instead we we evangelize

1274
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:58,760
security because we believe in security

1275
00:47:56,150 --> 00:48:00,920
and we have people called evangelists

1276
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:03,320
whose job is to evangelize security and

1277
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:05,210
try to try to have no security revivals

1278
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:06,920
and and persuade the business to believe

1279
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:09,620
in security and take it more seriously

1280
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:11,480
and you know if we decide now granted

1281
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:12,529
this is this is I'm getting myself in

1282
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,970
more trouble here because this is

1283
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:16,310
probably a controversial thing to say

1284
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:19,220
but I think the question is valid is are

1285
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:21,200
we practicing a religious approach to an

1286
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:24,379
economic problem if we are that's not

1287
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:26,210
rational that's not rational and that's

1288
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:29,420
not going to help and so we need to

1289
00:48:26,210 --> 00:48:31,160
think about that on the proposal I'll

1290
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:34,160
leave you with is that this is a quote

1291
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:38,149
from Justice Brandeis on what I'll say

1292
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:39,290
and it quickly is that all of these

1293
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:40,490
approaches were talking about are

1294
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:42,350
designed to try to surface this

1295
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:44,000
information into the hands of software

1296
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:45,740
consumers and software buyers to make

1297
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,480
more informed decisions but they're all

1298
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:49,100
very convoluted and direct ways of doing

1299
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:51,020
it why don't we just surface this

1300
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:53,240
information why don't we say okay

1301
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:54,410
software manufacturers you need to

1302
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:56,660
publish your security

1303
00:48:54,410 --> 00:48:58,220
backlogs and tell us what you know and

1304
00:48:56,660 --> 00:49:00,078
what's sitting in your backlogs for

1305
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:02,808
products that you're shipping not always

1306
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:04,819
that is not public and then software

1307
00:49:02,809 --> 00:49:06,200
consumers can read analyst can write

1308
00:49:04,819 --> 00:49:08,299
about this and who's doing a better

1309
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:10,189
worst job on security and then consumers

1310
00:49:08,299 --> 00:49:11,390
can vote with their feet and that would

1311
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:16,400
be something that's relatively simple

1312
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:17,420
and implementable so I will follow up

1313
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:22,599
with a blog post with these

1314
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:22,599
acknowledgments but that is my talk

1315
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:25,549
