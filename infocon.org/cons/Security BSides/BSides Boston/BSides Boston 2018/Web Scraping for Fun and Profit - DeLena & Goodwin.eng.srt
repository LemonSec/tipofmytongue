1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,570
my name is Nick Kalina this is Scot

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:05,430
Goodwin we're from OCD Tech which is the

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,109
IT audit and security division of

4
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,760
O'Connor and Dru with regional

5
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:11,309
accounting firm we're going to talk

6
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,320
about Hastings great thing and the

7
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:14,879
implications for everyone in this room

8
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,010
and everyone in the greater world

9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,800
I'll let Scott take it off thank you

10
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,789
thank you so we're going to yeah we're

11
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,100
gonna be talking about a web scraping

12
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:26,060
platform that we've designed at OCD tech

13
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:28,230
to monitor and collect data related to

14
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:30,840
information leaks and security breaches

15
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,640
that have been posted to public sources

16
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,399
like pastebin and other page style

17
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,870
websites so we'll start with in just an

18
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,390
intro to open source intelligence and

19
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,800
some of the sources that we're using the

20
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,480
tools that we've used up to this point

21
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,059
to collect some of that information and

22
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,709
then why we decided to build our own to

23
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:48,890
collect a subset of information that's

24
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:52,050
kind of poorly captured by those tools

25
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:54,360
we'll talk about where that data is

26
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,709
ending up for some smaller and even the

27
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,089
large breaches where that data is ending

28
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,109
up on the Internet and how we can

29
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,050
leverage that to capture that

30
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:03,359
information take a look at the scraping

31
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,670
platform itself how it's built how we're

32
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,810
using it and finally we'll look at some

33
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,640
examples of the data that we've captured

34
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,740
over the past year so we've been

35
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,510
scraping pastebin and other pastebin

36
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:16,048
style sites for about a year so we have

37
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:17,850
a pretty big data set to play with so to

38
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:20,189
start open source intelligence that's an

39
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,449
umbrella term we give to the tools that

40
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:24,570
we use to collect the data as well as

41
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,740
the data that comes back I want us for

42
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,059
people who aren't familiar I want to

43
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,490
distinguish open source intelligence

44
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,320
from the open source that you hear with

45
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,059
regards to software where you have

46
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,649
access to that the source code itself in

47
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,939
this case it really means that that data

48
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,520
is being collected from the public

49
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:41,880
domain from sources that everybody in

50
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:44,610
the room has access to so in the context

51
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,710
of security research and our team we're

52
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:49,229
collecting data about a business

53
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:50,309
sometimes more granularly collecting

54
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:51,630
information about the employees of that

55
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,329
business trying to get an idea for the

56
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:56,310
organizational structure while we're

57
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:59,008
planning a security assessment or a pen

58
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,909
test and then also obviously we're

59
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:03,030
collecting information about the

60
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:04,770
technical infrastructure using DNS to

61
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,329
get host names and IP addresses and then

62
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,280
who is you can connect some of those

63
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:10,019
names that you got in the last step to

64
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,030
the DNS records who owns those websites

65
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,330
and then any internet facing systems

66
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:16,240
that we have so

67
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:17,860
your firewalls and routers and load

68
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,380
balancers and anything that sits inside

69
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:21,580
your DMZ so we'll be you know pinging

70
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:24,730
and probing those systems trying to get

71
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:26,710
as much information as possible and we

72
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:27,790
use a number of tools some most of you

73
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:31,630
are probably familiar with tools like

74
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:34,690
recon ng and the harvester discover

75
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:36,400
scripts and they're really great for a

76
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:38,260
point in time assessment to bring in as

77
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,450
much information for whatever sources

78
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,739
they're using for those tools you can

79
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:43,299
get a point in time assessment of the

80
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:46,060
information that's available on the

81
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,650
Internet and what we found is what you

82
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:49,600
get back is some personnel information

83
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:51,840
you can generate employee lists and an

84
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,650
email address lists and stuff like that

85
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,390
but what you get back is mostly

86
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:57,310
technical data you can get back a lot of

87
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:59,290
information to start assembling a

88
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,720
picture of their from the outside of

89
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:03,670
what their network looks like but the

90
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,590
problem is most of that data is known to

91
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:06,910
be public already sometimes you'll find

92
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:08,440
you know the easter-egg of something

93
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:12,850
that somebody didn't know was made

94
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:15,160
public and one thing that we tried to

95
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:16,060
use these tools for and realize that

96
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,310
they don't work very well in this

97
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:20,860
capacity is to identify new data that's

98
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:22,630
been released for a target so if

99
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,739
something new is released and you

100
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:25,690
compare that back to the data that you

101
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:27,720
had before you could identify that some

102
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:30,010
new information had been made public and

103
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,900
they don't work in that capacity that's

104
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:34,450
not what they're designed to do so what

105
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,830
we designed was a tool to capture or

106
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:39,339
subset of data on the internet that's

107
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:40,840
really not well analyzed by those types

108
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,430
of tools and what we're really going

109
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,540
after is we want to get right to the

110
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,000
password we want to capture any

111
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:49,060
information to capture email address and

112
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,890
password together and that information

113
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:52,750
is out there and it's not something that

114
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:56,410
you can reliably pull back with existing

115
00:03:52,750 --> 00:04:00,310
tools so in order to do that we're

116
00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:01,299
leveraging paste style websites for

117
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:03,760
those of you aren't familiar with

118
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:06,220
something like paste bin they get their

119
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,709
name from your ability to copy any text

120
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,730
you want and paste it to the website and

121
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:13,090
once you click Submit

122
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:15,579
you're granted a URL dedicated to that

123
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,810
text so you don't have to register a

124
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,769
domain name you don't have to sign up

125
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,720
with paste bin or any of these other

126
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:23,100
sites really some of them you do but

127
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:25,960
pastebin allows anonymous pastes and

128
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,980
because of the anonymous aspect of it

129
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,960
they're being

130
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:30,220
abused by hackers and attackers to

131
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,320
release that information to the public

132
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:35,500
in cases where they're either trying to

133
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,700
make that data for sale make that data

134
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,690
available on the dark web so they'll

135
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:41,830
give you a link to where you can go buy

136
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:43,210
it or releasing that data just to either

137
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:45,550
take credit for the for the breach that

138
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:48,190
they committed or to increase the

139
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:49,780
damages to that target organization so

140
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:52,660
lots of data is getting posted to

141
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:56,289
paceman and and others and other sites

142
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:57,100
as well actually and I want to be clear

143
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,300
that that's not what they're designed

144
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,710
for obviously they were designed

145
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,920
originally for code sharing and

146
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:04,780
collaboration for developers on opposite

147
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:07,120
sides of the planet want to share code

148
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:08,890
for debugging and peer review without

149
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,250
having to use an extra layer like email

150
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:13,570
or FTP so there's an awful lot of

151
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,530
legitimate traffic on these websites as

152
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:17,320
well and that's why they're still

153
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:20,440
available but what we're trying to do is

154
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:23,110
grab all that illicit material that's

155
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,400
being posted there as well so that's

156
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,900
what we've done we've we're

157
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,580
programmatically extracting data from

158
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:30,539
pastebin and other web sites to pull

159
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:32,200
down everything that's there and then

160
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:34,960
secondarily go through that information

161
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,950
and try to understand pull out the

162
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,390
information that we're interested in

163
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:41,050
which is obviously not the majority of

164
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:42,520
the traffic that you see from a web

165
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:45,190
scraping perspective you're limited by

166
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,659
the the sources that you can scrape so

167
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:49,660
you have to have access to that site and

168
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:51,100
a lot of web sites like you can get an

169
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,960
awful lot of information by parsing

170
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,670
social media and stuff like that but

171
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,599
once you need there's an Authenticator

172
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:57,130
there you need to have a username and

173
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,990
password and once you've authenticated

174
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:00,250
you still only have access to your

175
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:04,840
network you can you can't see everything

176
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:07,930
that's actually there and hackers

177
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,849
wouldn't use that forum to release

178
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:11,800
information publicly anyways their

179
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:15,580
intent is to get as many eyes on that

180
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:18,940
data as possible so pastebin style

181
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:20,770
site-geist and flexi and pastebin they

182
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:23,350
really they fit the bill for this type

183
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:25,270
of information leakage and you're also

184
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:28,000
limited to a certain extent by you know

185
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:29,159
acceptable use when your program

186
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,910
programming

187
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,800
requests when you're programmatically

188
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:35,230
making requests over the Internet it's

189
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,390
really easy to not tune the scraper and

190
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:39,820
send way too many requests more than

191
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:40,919
whatever be necessary to that resource

192
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,689
on the Internet

193
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:44,340
and if that happens in most cases

194
00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:46,080
they'll just shut you off or throttle

195
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,090
the connection so you have to be careful

196
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,050
it comes down to tuning to get

197
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:52,619
everything that you do need without

198
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:54,210
making extra requests the tool that we

199
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,539
built is built on our standard lamp

200
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:59,849
stack so we have a dedicated a boom to

201
00:06:56,539 --> 00:07:02,009
VM Apache web server on the front end

202
00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:03,659
for with PHP myadmin which we don't

203
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:06,210
generally use that often but we have it

204
00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:07,860
my sequel database in the backend and

205
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:10,549
the entire platform is written in Python

206
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:13,349
the actual analysis is happening Python

207
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:17,340
so we'll go through how it works just

208
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:21,300
really quickly this is for paste bin but

209
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:23,188
it applies to any pay style website that

210
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,680
publishes this archive page so we first

211
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:28,080
will step one is to reach out to the URL

212
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,150
pastebin.com slash archive and by

213
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,810
parsing the raw HTML content on that

214
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:36,448
page you can extract links to all of the

215
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:39,300
recently created pastes so so the posted

216
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:40,860
time over there was zero seconds ago so

217
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,199
this is constantly updated list of paste

218
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,310
that have been created so that Stepan

219
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,759
creates a list of paste that you're

220
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:49,349
interested in scraping and then

221
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:50,849
separately we'll take that list and go

222
00:07:49,349 --> 00:07:53,099
through each one of them reach out to

223
00:07:50,849 --> 00:07:55,080
paceman at that URL and pull down that

224
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:57,899
route text as long as we haven't seen it

225
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:00,568
already and so now we have a paste

226
00:07:57,899 --> 00:08:02,699
locally on our VM in memory that came

227
00:08:00,569 --> 00:08:04,949
from paestum at that point what we did

228
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:06,479
originally was take the paste and put it

229
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:08,460
right into the database that was like

230
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,620
the proof of concept stage we didn't

231
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:13,020
perform any analysis on it and then as

232
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:16,080
the dataset grew in the dataset grows

233
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:18,810
very quickly it became harder and harder

234
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,849
to use that data for anything any pay an

235
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:23,039
individual pace can have a thousand

236
00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:26,520
lines or more thousands of lines and we

237
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:28,110
have millions of pastes so by not

238
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,240
performing any analysis on the front end

239
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:32,699
we were relegated to full-text searches

240
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,430
only which became incredibly exhaustive

241
00:08:32,698 --> 00:08:36,779
from a time and resource perspective so

242
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:39,448
what we do now

243
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:41,370
kind of like version two is while we

244
00:08:39,448 --> 00:08:43,529
have that paste in memory we extract

245
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:46,860
information types that we think we're

246
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:49,829
interested in now so one example that we

247
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:52,140
have up here is an email and password

248
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:54,349
combination so we have an MIT edu

249
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:57,650
password I mean an email address

250
00:08:54,350 --> 00:09:00,640
with a colon followed by a string and

251
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:02,840
that string represents a password hash

252
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:07,160
so we're using regular expressions to

253
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:08,510
match username and password combinations

254
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,730
that are separated by a delimiter

255
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:12,530
usually a colon or the pipe character

256
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:14,840
and we have other one set up for other

257
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:16,310
types of information as well so now we

258
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,410
extract that information and we store it

259
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:19,790
in a separate table on the database

260
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:21,290
which is indexed so we can get to that

261
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:22,819
data we have a lot more visibility into

262
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:25,670
the data now because the data set is

263
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:27,050
growing so quickly at this point these

264
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:29,420
are rough numbers it's changing all the

265
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:31,160
time it's running as we speak we have 8

266
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:32,599
million or so pastes over the last year

267
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,699
with some downtime in there so it hasn't

268
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:37,220
been a complete year four and a half

269
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,960
million email addresses that we pulled

270
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:41,750
out of these pastes so if I was a

271
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:43,250
spammer you know we can stop right here

272
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:45,410
we have a we have a tool that's

273
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:48,080
generating email addresses in real time

274
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:50,600
and then crucially the one and a half

275
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,280
million about of those email emails had

276
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,780
a password associated with them in the

277
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,640
standard format that we see which is

278
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:57,860
email followed by a colon or a pipe

279
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:00,610
character and then the password

280
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:03,410
we're also extracting IP addresses and

281
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:05,090
finally onion links and I'm sure most of

282
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:07,550
you're aware that those are links to the

283
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:12,200
dark the dark web for lack of a better

284
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:14,180
term and we collect those because it's

285
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,010
hard to find resources on the dark web

286
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,660
if you don't already have URL so we're

287
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:19,580
scrape that we're collecting those onion

288
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,420
links now and in the future since

289
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:23,330
there's such a wealth of information

290
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:24,740
available on the dark web the future

291
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:26,770
state will be that those onion links are

292
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:29,720
actually populating their own scraper so

293
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:31,130
at this point I want to make clear what

294
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,990
we're going to be showing you and why

295
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:36,950
we're interested in this data and it's

296
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:39,680
because there is a tendency for users to

297
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:42,350
do two things one of them is reuse their

298
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,810
corporate or business kernel address on

299
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:47,770
external services which is something

300
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:50,180
that has to happen sometimes it's not

301
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:51,620
necessarily something we you know you

302
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:53,390
frowned upon using the email address on

303
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:57,560
an external service sometimes it's

304
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:59,330
frowned upon but also the reuse of

305
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:02,719
passwords across multiple services so

306
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:04,490
we're targeting corporate or business

307
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,650
credentials that have been released to

308
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:07,939
pastebin and other websites as a result

309
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:10,970
of a breach that happened on

310
00:11:07,939 --> 00:11:12,559
one else's server so when we have you

311
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:14,089
know a breach of some random website on

312
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:15,618
the internet that data doesn't

313
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:17,449
necessarily have a lot of value you know

314
00:11:15,619 --> 00:11:18,739
it's not like a Dropbox or yahoo breach

315
00:11:17,449 --> 00:11:20,748
where it's millions and millions of

316
00:11:18,739 --> 00:11:25,429
records it affects a smaller user base

317
00:11:20,749 --> 00:11:27,709
and they can't necessarily make any real

318
00:11:25,429 --> 00:11:29,059
money off of that data so they posted to

319
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:30,589
paceman to make it public and take

320
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:33,399
credit for what they've done

321
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:37,549
but in that data there is regularly

322
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:40,399
corporate email addresses for agencies

323
00:11:37,549 --> 00:11:41,899
and businesses of all types and when

324
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,970
there's a password associated with that

325
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:45,709
email address there's always a chance

326
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:47,479
that that's a valid password for the for

327
00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:48,319
the organization itself so that's what

328
00:11:47,479 --> 00:11:50,479
we're targeting and that's what we're

329
00:11:48,319 --> 00:11:52,459
going to be showing you later on with

330
00:11:50,479 --> 00:11:55,519
the examples so how do we use this data

331
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:57,049
internally well obviously we like to go

332
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,669
through the data for from a research

333
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,779
perspective that's what I spend a lot of

334
00:11:58,669 --> 00:12:00,249
time doing trying to see what's been

335
00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:02,929
released

336
00:12:00,249 --> 00:12:04,309
but also for vulnerability assessments

337
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:07,249
and pen tests this is you know one of

338
00:12:04,309 --> 00:12:09,108
our first stops we have a year's worth

339
00:12:07,249 --> 00:12:11,239
of paceman data and ideally we would be

340
00:12:09,109 --> 00:12:13,609
entering these environments already

341
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:15,139
having credentials to the you know to

342
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:16,189
the environment they don't have to be

343
00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:18,169
admin credentials or anything like that

344
00:12:16,189 --> 00:12:20,118
but we can hopefully we'll be starting

345
00:12:18,169 --> 00:12:23,419
an engagement already having some

346
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:24,889
credentials to that environment but so

347
00:12:23,419 --> 00:12:26,179
besides those two things what we were

348
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:27,739
trying to do at the very beginning was

349
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:30,470
come up with a way to create alerts

350
00:12:27,739 --> 00:12:32,599
based on our own information being

351
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:35,329
released to pastebin clients partners or

352
00:12:32,599 --> 00:12:36,529
vendors that whole supply chain so if

353
00:12:35,329 --> 00:12:38,659
any of that information makes its way to

354
00:12:36,529 --> 00:12:41,089
pastebin we want to create alert on that

355
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:43,419
and initially we had sent those via

356
00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:45,889
email just like every other service and

357
00:12:43,419 --> 00:12:47,659
people stopped looking at them as is to

358
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:49,459
be expected so now we're doing sending

359
00:12:47,659 --> 00:12:52,549
them directly to slack so which is a

360
00:12:49,459 --> 00:12:54,439
chat program they have laptop and mobile

361
00:12:52,549 --> 00:12:57,079
clients so we're getting these letters

362
00:12:54,439 --> 00:12:59,449
right to our cell phone and we've also

363
00:12:57,079 --> 00:13:02,089
set up the ability to search through

364
00:12:59,449 --> 00:13:04,569
that database via slack so we have

365
00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:07,069
pretty much the databases more or less

366
00:13:04,569 --> 00:13:08,209
pretty well integrated from a mobile

367
00:13:07,069 --> 00:13:10,248
device standpoint you don't need to have

368
00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:12,319
VPN access or you don't need to putty

369
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:14,899
none of that stuff no my sequel syntax

370
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:16,639
just basic searching can be completed

371
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:17,600
via slack so let's take a look at some

372
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,920
of the data that we found over the last

373
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:23,300
year the nasa breach was semi publicized

374
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,319
you might have heard of that that a lot

375
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:27,680
of that information was released a

376
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,329
pastebin we have FBI credentials you see

377
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,449
that there's a hash up there and I left

378
00:13:29,329 --> 00:13:33,859
the IP address unobscured as well

379
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:35,180
because it shows that you know we're

380
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:37,010
using pattern matching to do this we're

381
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:38,569
not we don't know what that piece of

382
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:41,029
data is that's after that delimiter in

383
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:42,380
this case it was an IP address and that

384
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:44,689
might not be a password but we can still

385
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:46,209
associate that IP address would be with

386
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:49,130
the FBI

387
00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:50,060
email address that goes with it so we're

388
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,310
capturing all that information

389
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:53,268
regardless of what the string is

390
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:55,430
Department Homeland Security and then

391
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:59,930
from an infrastructure standpoint the

392
00:13:55,430 --> 00:14:01,279
United States the parts of energy we've

393
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:03,800
captured credentials for the Federal

394
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,939
Reserve Bank over last year the

395
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,469
Securities and Exchange Commission we

396
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:08,750
captured one password that's potentially

397
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:11,180
valid in that environment and then the

398
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:13,190
FDIC we also captured a number of emails

399
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:14,899
no passwords though and I left that in

400
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:16,730
there because I think that most people

401
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:19,850
would still be interested to understand

402
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:22,160
the context of how their agencies or

403
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:23,810
their businesses email addresses even

404
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:27,290
email by itself is making its way to

405
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:28,910
paste bin you know you don't this is a

406
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:30,890
if they are not aware of that

407
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:32,600
information making its way out then

408
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:37,100
there's a chance that you know it came

409
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:39,949
from inside their network I'm pulled out

410
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:41,810
I tried to take a breath over deft

411
00:14:39,949 --> 00:14:43,819
approach with these examples trying to

412
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:46,250
show that large companies are affected

413
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:48,529
by this just as a result of the number

414
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:50,000
of users that they have so there's the

415
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:52,180
more users that you have the more email

416
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,350
addresses you have in exchange the more

417
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:55,670
users are spreading that information out

418
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:57,350
over the internet and the more

419
00:14:55,670 --> 00:15:01,040
opportunities you have for password

420
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:02,060
reuse so UnitedHealthcare that's the

421
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,260
larger self care provide in the United

422
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,540
States we have credentials that are

423
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:08,360
potentially about in that environment

424
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:09,920
pharmaceutical McKesson the same story

425
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:13,220
from the defense sector we pulled out

426
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:15,410
Raytheon got a couple passwords for them

427
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:18,290
and then in the retail space we pulled

428
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:22,250
out Walmart a single password for them

429
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:23,719
as well Ford looks like they might have

430
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,500
had an actual breach it's kind of hard

431
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:28,820
to tell

432
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:30,589
that's quite a few passwords Amazon has

433
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,790
a pretty big presence here it's security

434
00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:34,310
beside so we pulled them out for the

435
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:36,170
furry commerce

436
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:38,239
and for communication people let AT&T so

437
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:40,579
it really does spans all industry

438
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,380
sectors medium to large sized businesses

439
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,220
this is more of an eventualities than it

440
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:46,189
is anything else

441
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:47,960
in our perspective I mean I have trouble

442
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:50,180
I'm you're more likely to find it than

443
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:53,089
not find it for large businesses in our

444
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:56,599
pay spend database since Harvard is nice

445
00:15:53,089 --> 00:15:59,150
enough to partner with security besides

446
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,800
this year I figured it would be a good

447
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:05,270
forum to bring up higher education

448
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:06,650
because we see more dot edu credentials

449
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:09,800
on pastebin than any other top-level

450
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:11,990
domain and that's again a function of

451
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:14,719
that intuitive trend that you have more

452
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:16,270
users and in this case more users who

453
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,730
aren't necessarily security focused

454
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:22,069
spreading that information out and we

455
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:23,420
you know students are probably just as

456
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:25,670
likely as everyone else to be reusing

457
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:28,219
those passwords too so this is not a

458
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:30,020
Harvard University problem by any means

459
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:32,089
these are student credentials their

460
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:34,220
student bodies you know constantly

461
00:16:32,089 --> 00:16:37,540
changing are always provisioning new

462
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:39,770
email addresses and revoking old ones so

463
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:43,250
you know we're pretty interested to find

464
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:44,750
out one what percentage of these

465
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:46,520
credentials are potentially valid for

466
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:50,230
higher education institutions not just

467
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:51,860
Harvard but anybody and then to you know

468
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:53,089
what can we get to with those

469
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,290
credentials not you know we're not going

470
00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:56,450
out and validating that any of these

471
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:59,089
work but you know is none of these

472
00:16:56,450 --> 00:17:00,170
student portals usually have two-factor

473
00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:02,360
authentication or anything like that

474
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:05,569
because it's such a burden for the for

475
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:07,010
the whole environment so you know every

476
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:09,550
every University has a student portal

477
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:12,109
and they're all available online so

478
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:13,280
statistically this is only a subset I

479
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:14,569
mean we've had we have a hundred in the

480
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,030
last year for Harvard University

481
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:19,459
distinct email and password combinations

482
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:20,569
so statistically speaking I think we

483
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:25,939
should be able to get access to some

484
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:27,530
financial records web scraping for fun

485
00:17:25,939 --> 00:17:31,310
and profit so I had talked about the fun

486
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:34,970
part from the profit perspective paceman

487
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:36,879
is a clearinghouse for stolen data it's

488
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:40,640
an advertising platform for hackers

489
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:43,070
you'll it's constantly finding links to

490
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,960
purchase this information in Bitcoin on

491
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:47,540
external sites usually on the dark web

492
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,990
but we do see credit card numbers very

493
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:50,540
very

494
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:55,160
regularly posted to pastebin and and

495
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:56,659
other paste style websites and we use

496
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:59,480
regular expressions again for this

497
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:02,690
pattern matching and what it comes down

498
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:04,070
to is that we see so many that it's

499
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:05,330
really highly unlikely that they're all

500
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:08,330
valid credit card numbers even though

501
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:10,820
they match that pattern so what we do is

502
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:13,520
we retain the paste ID in this table so

503
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:15,470
we can always refer back to the raw

504
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,090
paste so we can get the context of how

505
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:19,429
that credit credit card or potential

506
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:20,629
credit card number was released and try

507
00:18:19,429 --> 00:18:21,470
to understand if it really represents a

508
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:23,570
credit card number because you know

509
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:25,090
these for instance these ones down here

510
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:28,790
that have the space right in the middle

511
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:31,100
it's hard to tell I mean generally their

512
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:33,200
system logs and tons of code and

513
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,760
encrypted data and binary data people

514
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,980
post all sorts of things to paste them

515
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,390
so we kind of have to take a holistic

516
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:40,340
approach to pulling out these numbers

517
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:41,540
and if we were interested in finding out

518
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:43,250
if they're real or not we'd have to go

519
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:47,990
back to that original paste and try to

520
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:49,400
get that context so we're not really

521
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:50,570
profiting off of this obviously we're

522
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,530
not using those credit card numbers and

523
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:53,480
we're not trying any of these

524
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:55,940
credentials that we found for us it's

525
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,410
more about a potential savings so we're

526
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:59,270
going to try to identify those threats

527
00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:00,890
as soon as they're made public obviously

528
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:02,090
we have no visibility into what happened

529
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:04,490
with those credentials before they are

530
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:06,290
made public or who else has them prior

531
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:09,020
to that but as soon as that information

532
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:10,250
is made public and I assure you that

533
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:13,250
we're not the only people who are doing

534
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:15,110
this once that data is made public it

535
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,850
becomes a risk to that in that

536
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:18,649
environment that someone else is going

537
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:21,530
to try to use those credentials against

538
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:22,820
you so the faster that we can respond to

539
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:24,320
these types of things and you know

540
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,909
basically change that password if it

541
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,950
happened to be a legitimate password

542
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:29,000
we're going to limit the damages we're

543
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:30,710
going to limit the ability of an

544
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,140
attacker to use public domain data

545
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:38,630
against us and you know at the bottom

546
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:41,059
pretty common commonly cited stat is the

547
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:42,290
cost of a data breach and any single one

548
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:43,580
of these credentials could instigate a

549
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:44,720
breach like that even if they're not you

550
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:46,580
know domain admin or anything like that

551
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,809
once you have access to an email inbox

552
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:51,199
or something like that you can start

553
00:19:47,809 --> 00:19:53,210
pivoting and gaining trust and you have

554
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,410
a foothold in that environment so for

555
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:55,670
our for our perspective it's not about

556
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:57,880
making money as much as it is saving

557
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,880
money

558
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:17,780
question it was any freedom for a guide

559
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:21,169
like these others not to limit the many

560
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:22,399
good reason for they would do that that

561
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:25,400
would in fact sir their ability to

562
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,720
provide service to customers so the

563
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,300
question is is there any reason for them

564
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,280
not to do it exactly so like they

565
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:33,230
haven't done it yet I mean I think that

566
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:36,800
it sounds like like one of the possible

567
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:38,480
ways to sort of mitigate this as special

568
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:40,100
risk as you know you guys good good that

569
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,350
you're really doing this to to access

570
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:45,350
and others may not be so absolutely so

571
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:49,820
page Benton is absolutely aware of this

572
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:51,350
problem and they are more or less

573
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,770
profiting off of it to be honest with

574
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:54,139
you

575
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:55,660
so previous to have one haffley to

576
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:59,120
describe a project maybe six months ago

577
00:20:55,660 --> 00:21:00,590
we were doing raw HTML scraping parsing

578
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,909
the raw HTML content on the page and

579
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:04,189
pulling out the you know the raw text

580
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:06,080
from the paste and that's what we still

581
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:09,410
have to do for all other sources that

582
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:13,250
we're scraping paste bin released an API

583
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:15,830
for scraping and if you don't if you

584
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:18,080
don't use their API they're going to

585
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:21,169
shut you off immediately we've had

586
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:23,178
issues with other services throttling

587
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:27,080
drawing the connection and whatnot but

588
00:21:23,179 --> 00:21:28,130
um the real way that they're mitigating

589
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,840
this and paceman is not doing anything

590
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:31,640
to mitigate this they will remove paste

591
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,590
data that's been made public but it's

592
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,910
not before the data is made public so

593
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:36,980
the data gets posted to that archive

594
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:38,990
page that I showed you immediately and

595
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:40,940
we're scraping all that and we raise on

596
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:42,320
alert often times by the time the alert

597
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,670
makes it to the cellphone and you try to

598
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,320
click the link to go look at the paste

599
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:47,450
the pace has already been removed and

600
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,770
paste them but the page is in our paste

601
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:51,920
bin database and it's in everybody else

602
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:53,330
is based on database already so other

603
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,850
services and the services that we're not

604
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:57,470
scraping are ones that have either a an

605
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:59,629
Authenticator in front of that page so

606
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:00,770
you have to log in and only see your

607
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:03,830
network of people that you're allowed to

608
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:06,710
talk with really or be they don't make

609
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:08,240
the list of pastes public so you don't

610
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:10,580
know what you're looking for

611
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,080
they don't make an archive page public

612
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,949
so I can create a list of pace that I

613
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,750
want to go out and scrape

614
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:16,550
I would have to basically guess paste

615
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:19,220
IDs until I found them and that's just

616
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:21,560
not going to work so the real way that

617
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:24,830
they're mitigating this is by not making

618
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:27,050
public pastes not making the URL for

619
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:28,639
public pastes public domain even though

620
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:30,169
if I navigate it to that URL I would

621
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:36,910
still be able to access that I just

622
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:36,910
don't have that data to start with yep

623
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:45,020
yep that's why we keep the original

624
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:47,510
information of the original paste so we

625
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:50,270
always reference back usually what you

626
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:51,980
find is that they'll either be either

627
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:53,360
portion of the credit card number or the

628
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:54,830
whole credit card number with no extra

629
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,560
information and then a link to go

630
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:59,750
purchase these records on the dark web

631
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:00,889
it's not we try to create I try to

632
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:02,630
create a regular expression that would

633
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:04,460
also parse out the sea snail the CCD

634
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:06,530
number and everything else and them it

635
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:08,480
just broke every time so what we have to

636
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:10,040
do is when we find a credit card that

637
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,210
Mike we haven't really started digging

638
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,590
into the credit card data yet because

639
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:14,660
there's nothing we can really do with it

640
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:16,189
I'm gonna borrow credit card data you

641
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,750
know popped up we could go back and

642
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:20,960
verify whether or not it came out of

643
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:23,060
some random junk data or fit them and we

644
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,680
do see full credit card we have

645
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:26,030
absolutely seen full full records

646
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,050
released and that doesn't mean that

647
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,639
they'll work I mean it could be shut

648
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:32,330
down or whatever but they're absolutely

649
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:37,310
full records available - sure

650
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:39,139
and is there another question yeah sure

651
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:41,270
which is in general are you seeing is

652
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:43,340
there a sizing or is routine works on

653
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:44,450
small boss there is a size limit a max

654
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:46,939
size limit on the page and think it's

655
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:49,660
500 kilobytes okay people are making you

656
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:51,890
can make multiple pace write in a row

657
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:53,330
but there is a limit just based on

658
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:54,890
bandwidth kind of that they put a

659
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:57,740
pastebin puts a limit on how big of a

660
00:23:54,890 --> 00:24:01,910
pace that you can create so I'm going to

661
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:03,170
get out of here and in order to give a

662
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:04,850
demo I'm going to search right from

663
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:06,920
slack so you know we could log into the

664
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:08,990
database and do it that way but I'm

665
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:10,850
going to pull up our slack client is

666
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:16,890
anyone brave enough to offer a domain

667
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:22,860
that they're so yeah but you got yes

668
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:24,780
it okay I will give you a there's a

669
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:27,000
disclaimer that's as you can see right

670
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:29,010
here if there was a plaintext password

671
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,150
associated with that domain it's going

672
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:32,150
to show up right here okay

673
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:36,720
so you know I'll show you this to shell

674
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:42,750
CMD paste bin

675
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:44,760
we're telling we're going to tell our we

676
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:45,750
have a robot set up to do this we're

677
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,600
going to tell the robot that we're going

678
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:50,160
to be executing command and bash which

679
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,860
is called paste bin and that's living on

680
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:55,110
a VM on our network and then we're going

681
00:24:52,860 --> 00:25:04,649
to do researching for a domain and once

682
00:24:55,110 --> 00:25:05,909
again are you and I didn't put in a

683
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:07,950
condition that says that there's nothing

684
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:11,670
say no so that means nothing

685
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:13,980
so you're clean say big you know it

686
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:43,100
works really well for for big big

687
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:43,100
domains yep VA n OB given job required

688
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:51,240
yeah as long as I thought so yeah

689
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:53,370
proof it does work what was let yeah

690
00:25:51,240 --> 00:26:03,480
between do Qualcomm which is two M's

691
00:25:53,370 --> 00:26:05,790
right yeah yeah the bigger the domain

692
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,390
the more likely this is to be a you know

693
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:09,418
problem

694
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:10,530
it's just statistics really it's not to

695
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:13,820
say we don't find small businesses

696
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:16,860
that's an issue as well we certainly do

697
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:18,270
so now these are somebody posted the

698
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:21,360
same thing over and over again so we got

699
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:24,320
no passwords there but hand these are

700
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:28,129
all from individual pastes negatives

701
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:37,950
well we have one but there's no password

702
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:40,500
yep yes but it's locked down entirely to

703
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:42,780
those words yeah I can't I can't run

704
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:46,559
whatever I want I've know so we don't

705
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:50,070
have we this is not an interactive bass

706
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:52,168
show now this is me calling out to a

707
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:53,760
server that we've set up to to run a

708
00:26:52,169 --> 00:26:55,980
specific script and it doesn't accept

709
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,030
anything else except for there's a

710
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,169
number of things that we can do with

711
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:59,399
this robot but it doesn't accept

712
00:26:58,169 --> 00:27:07,530
anything outside of that so you can't

713
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:07,860
run RM minus RF soon pardon absolutely

714
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:09,600
not

715
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,860
this I'm not a developer I hope nobody

716
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,639
nobody touch any of the stuff because

717
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,639
I'm sure it's very fragile

718
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:33,780
but proof of concept it does work that's

719
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:37,379
the excellent question we've we've been

720
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:38,639
struggling with how you know what what

721
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:41,159
controls really need to be in place for

722
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,450
this type of data it's an excellent

723
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:45,330
question and everybody has their own

724
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:47,100
opinion and up until now or a little

725
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:48,720
while ago it was our answer was that

726
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:50,939
it's public domain data and we're not

727
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,620
the only people that have it but that

728
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:55,080
doesn't change the fact that it is PII

729
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:56,340
we have pretty I mean I'm the only one

730
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,559
with access to directly to the database

731
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:01,500
obviously anybody with access to slack

732
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:03,690
and search the database but we have

733
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:05,340
access controls and the virtual disk is

734
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:06,690
encrypted and that's all we have in

735
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,949
place I mean I'm scraping data from

736
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:13,799
pastebin that everyone else has as well

737
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:17,909
so more nefarious people yep you also

738
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:19,440
the other - it's a what is shown here is

739
00:28:17,909 --> 00:28:21,299
one of these identities where the hash

740
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,770
would be shown here we're not

741
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:24,960
differentiating between a password and a

742
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:27,330
hash anything that comes after the

743
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,679
delimiter next to an email address is

744
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:30,059
what we're calling the password so

745
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:32,460
sometimes that's hash if the web

746
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:34,830
application has two passwords sometimes

747
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:37,980
it's a plaintext password so we're not

748
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:39,928
free interests appreciating there so are

749
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:41,250
you collecting other types of logins

750
00:28:39,929 --> 00:28:44,130
though like usernames and are

751
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:46,909
necessarily addresses we have everything

752
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:49,530
that's supposed to paceman last year so

753
00:28:46,909 --> 00:28:50,880
the reason we keep everything is because

754
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:53,220
we can go back and answer questions like

755
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,230
that we can react whatever data we want

756
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:57,120
by designing a.m. we're running out of

757
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:58,230
time by designing a new regular

758
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,610
expression go back to that entire

759
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:01,559
database a year's worth of data a

760
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:03,059
hundred gigabytes extract every piece of

761
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:05,010
information are interested in storing

762
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:05,970
its own table so we're looking to do

763
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:08,059
that with social security numbers right

764
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:08,059
now

765
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:13,610
what's the ratio to hash passwords to

766
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:15,080
acquaintance we see many more plaintext

767
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:16,669
passwords and hash passwords and I

768
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,620
believe that's the result of some of

769
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:20,270
those plaintext passwords being a

770
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:21,439
complete bump it's hard to say we don't

771
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:23,030
know if it's really not we're not

772
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,760
validating any of this but when we see a

773
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:26,928
hash password the people who that

774
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,330
belongs to some project be nervous

775
00:29:26,929 --> 00:29:31,250
because it's generally real or you know

776
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:35,240
it's real for whatever resources

777
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:36,380
compromised we think so you know any

778
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:39,640
other questions you have to come up I'll

779
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:39,640
search but everyone sign up
