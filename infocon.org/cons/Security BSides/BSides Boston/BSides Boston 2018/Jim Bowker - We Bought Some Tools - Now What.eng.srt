1
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:11,600

2
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:15,110
really started sorry I'm gonna wander by

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:17,119

one in the Pilates with six and

5
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,050
seven-year-olds don't even oh it's just

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,070
for you positive age it really didn't

7
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:24,430
know just like how this is different

8
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:28,040
than you know getting whatever class

9
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:30,349
alright so here we go this must be

10
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:33,620
bought some tools now I eat yes

11
00:00:30,349 --> 00:00:38,390
principal was it based on conversation

12
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:41,140
I've had with the end of mine they were

13
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:44,540
going to an organization very immature

14
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:46,490
security programs no cable will download

15
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:49,160
some tools and get some free stuff and

16
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:52,700
put so I started some good tools place

17
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:55,069
month you know maybe pop you can expose

18
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,120
to use the skins that LTS so long you

19
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:58,550
know we're good we're going to be

20
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:02,300
securing out this week absolutely that's

21
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:03,769
not quite the way that worms and so my

22
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,330
purse you today is I'm going to try to

23
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:07,369
get people just a simple times either

24
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:09,920
starting up the information security

25
00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:12,020
program if there isn't much than your

26
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,780
current place or are just looking around

27
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:16,670
and seeing what people how is what I

28
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:18,439
have compared to you know put this

29
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:24,950
batter's box without up here and you

30
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:28,880
know people pleaser alright so a little

31
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:31,189
bit about me please jump up in a deeper

32
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,280
a bit now of information security flesh

33
00:01:31,189 --> 00:01:37,130
that hit or so got degrees inserts and

34
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,929
all that garbage stuff but important

35
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,908
takeaway from this is that when i'm at

36
00:01:38,929 --> 00:01:43,100
work they say it again he's the security

37
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:45,770
guy i work for a small company so it's

38
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:47,719
not a huge IT department and i get

39
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:49,189
anything out of them and then your desk

40
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:51,109
okay well you're gonna wanna them you

41
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:53,499
know go and talk to the director of your

42
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:56,658
songs with your security team though

43
00:01:53,499 --> 00:01:58,609
outside those with me excuse me I have a

44
00:01:56,659 --> 00:02:02,719
couple of hardened how you helped me out

45
00:01:58,609 --> 00:02:04,579
that's it the reason why you want for a

46
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,740
small program you want like Stoke Buddha

47
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:09,008
security diet is so that when there's

48
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:11,269
another request or something there's

49
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:14,089
somebody marketing that wants to use

50
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:17,090
some you to land they're going to put

51
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:19,640
all their data they say the salesman for

52
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:23,450
poets my museum us lodged up to secure

53
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:25,309
I want them instead to say my response

54
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,989
to autumns a fool's you're probably just

55
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:29,030
checked with us appear to die see you

56
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:31,760
know misfits in everything else going on

57
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:34,580
if you get nothing else today the

58
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:38,450
efforts that you make to ensure that

59
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:41,360
folks outside of security are talking to

60
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:43,519
you know new things that's important so

61
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,459
any time when security comes up it

62
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:49,040
should be thought through all right be

63
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:51,350
gentle I basically put this together

64
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:55,549
onto my slides last night decided on the

65
00:02:51,350 --> 00:03:00,230
last night after that dinner it was

66
00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:03,230
wanna do these things are so what we're

67
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:05,570
basically talking about here is a lot of

68
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:08,810
your most is based around process lots

69
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:10,730
and selling technology so who start

70
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:12,890
talking about framework dr. what I mean

71
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:15,829
by that and how a framework house

72
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:18,890
organize your efforts and portrays your

73
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:21,830
initiatives in a way that makes the

74
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:24,048
makes a lot more sense so I just tell my

75
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:27,530
boss aight i found this cool new tool

76
00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:28,820
and it's going to cost 10k 2015 say

77
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:31,310
whatever it is but don't worry be happy

78
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:33,859
cat-backs we should do it because i

79
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:35,570
think it looks really cool he's probably

80
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:38,360
going to say enough is available on the

81
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:40,459
cheap side and it's please my boss but

82
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,140
my from come say hey this is the whole

83
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:44,780
program to put together doing this

84
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:47,119
betweenness prioritize Allah Fisk's and

85
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,350
if we can dis we're going to reduce our

86
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,700
risk we're going to make this better or

87
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:51,590
we're going to solve on under whatever

88
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:53,359
it is explained the whole thing out and

89
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:55,340
then this is what it's going to cost and

90
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,530
reason we're doing this over this is

91
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:00,260
because I played it on love then he's

92
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:02,959
going to be far more likely to listen to

93
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:05,500
my thing there's also plenty of things

94
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:08,120
that you can do that don't possible

95
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:10,670
documentation just is going to cost your

96
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,959
time network so if you have your bowl

97
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:14,149
add together when it comes a lot of

98
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:16,910
documentation is done and then you can

99
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:19,459
present that it's going to change

100
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:22,880
people's flow problem reception where is

101
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:24,800
it just a security person who lots of

102
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,450
tools and stuff or is it that we've

103
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,020
developed the whole program and our

104
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:33,500
protein to the much more

105
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:35,000
that make sense okay what to do with

106
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,910
your boss gives you security chest with

107
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,889
a checklist ready magazine three might

108
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:42,040
have this in here because it's happened

109
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:44,389
to me more times than my judgment that

110
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:46,550
Bob's mom playing somewhere he's not a

111
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:50,570
bad guy but we must be pushing care

112
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:52,010
costs and off course we do Wall Street

113
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:54,139
Journal and it's if you have to do these

114
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:55,729
things otherwise just you know the

115
00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:57,530
world's gonna come to an end so I mean

116
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:59,349
you drop everything you're doing and fix

117
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:02,030
these five things that's what I've been

118
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:03,289
there that's all that's important and

119
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,969
he's going to take way that as long as

120
00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:06,440
he told me that I do something based on

121
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:08,060
that with you everything's gonna be fine

122
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,760
he doesn't care about all the things we

123
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:13,490
worked on the Hibiscus shoot how to

124
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:15,740
parent prioritizing worried about my

125
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:19,430
rhythm everything so talk about that

126
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:21,169
we'll talk about security council again

127
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:25,010
this goes to a programs maturity level

128
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:28,250
of security council is not just security

129
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:30,440
people it's that you get a few key users

130
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:32,090
from different areas and you're going to

131
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,940
talk about security so one thing you

132
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:36,799
have the kind of slave dump down but

133
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:38,330
communicated in such late at Nantes

134
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,720
approval under feel really comfortable

135
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:45,109
and what this gives you is it gives you

136
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,840
mine so if I'm talking to the heads of

137
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:50,060
some of the different practices and

138
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,409
someone from the HR department somebody

139
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:53,120
from the finance department where just

140
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:55,490
hasn't okay here so you don't want to be

141
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,080
issues that we have to tackle or

142
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:59,780
thinking of tape modify our external

143
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:01,820
consultants and using multi-factor

144
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:04,638
authentication song they don't need to

145
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:06,650
know which over use need to note that

146
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,570
why we're doing this and what effect

147
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:11,388
that has everything else this is where

148
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:13,099
I'm gonna get my champion from so when

149
00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:15,500
all of a sudden the HR department finds

150
00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:16,909
out that okay you know when we fold this

151
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,370
out they're going to be too you don't

152
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:21,440
take this little party kocaman put it is

153
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:23,000
number before they can get to the

154
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,580
network tears of the fire we're doing it

155
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,470
now i have a champion those persons one

156
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:29,270
communicate that to them someone who is

157
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,930
involves discussions and understands

158
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:33,630
this wasn't something just

159
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:36,930
capricious and whimsical decision on my

160
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:38,250
part I will talk about instant response

161
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,750
playing just at least to the high level

162
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:42,780
we'll talk about policies which

163
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:45,150
everybody knows lots talk above change

164
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:49,169
management found some basic pro speed

165
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:50,909
and seeing as how this is my first time

166
00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:52,979
one of these unfurnished and embrace to

167
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:57,180
the slides men 20th later I'll have

168
00:06:52,979 --> 00:07:01,560
those lines in it so like 16 here you

169
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:05,610
already number 37 all right vicious very

170
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:10,229
free market so this is a multi-purpose

171
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:11,880
document it does a lot of force so it's

172
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:14,870
not that difficult to rightful but it

173
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:18,150
helps you feel is it helps you kind of

174
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:21,330
organize your thoughts and later it will

175
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:23,698
be used to keep to eat your processing

176
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:24,900
line it's as I say hey I'm not going to

177
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:29,009
read everything on the slides the

178
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:30,239
military knows how to read them so it

179
00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:33,440
doesn't need to put everything but

180
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,820
really should so what I mean by that is

181
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,860
don't try the first pass to think of

182
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:39,510
every single possible thing you do in

183
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,970
terms of security to try to put it into

184
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:43,620
this one minute thought so when people

185
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:45,240
say hey what do you do for information

186
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,560
security you bring up this view the

187
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,510
broward he's got this hot repair okay

188
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:52,130
here's what we do nobody's going to be

189
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:54,659
dead especially nowadays and you know

190
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:57,270
the people of you that have an attention

191
00:07:54,659 --> 00:08:00,389
span slightly longer than that they're

192
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:01,948
not going to prepend so the idea is an

193
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:04,139
information security framework contains

194
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:08,250
a brief description somebody things you

195
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:10,050
do and then if they really care to read

196
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,759
more about any given month when you go

197
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:14,400
to whatever documentation is there so

198
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,199
you might have one item our intentions

199
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,070
on rebuilding engine it will tell them

200
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:18,449
that we're basically just a

201
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:22,770
comprehensive we have a front of

202
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:24,539
illuminating program yes and here's what

203
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:27,060
moderately management is in wonderful

204
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:28,800
sentences and if you care to beat any

205
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:31,800
more about it well if it's government

206
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:35,250
over here so that way if we change

207
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:38,419
something up I would go and change that

208
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:42,720
off and or have to change this

209
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:46,260
um when we have some new things that we

210
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:49,080
start doing that require me just decide

211
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:51,150
the order to implement men okay well we

212
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:54,030
should probably applies with a strategy

213
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:55,260
around so a person is in charge left

214
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,189
program goals and okay we're over

215
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,620
setting it up where he was dismissed

216
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:59,760
we're gonna talk about process that's

217
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:03,960
when you want to go and add something

218
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:06,090
into a very framework so shouldn't be a

219
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:10,070
big long tortuous country that you eat

220
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:12,630
fairly small few pages where it just

221
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:14,310
covers all of the basic things that

222
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:16,050
you're doing in terms of suitors though

223
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:17,339
you're not to think of everything ones

224
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:20,670
just put down some things you can think

225
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:22,440
of another living government since as

226
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:25,349
long as you too bad for medication is

227
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:30,150
mentioned here huh blocked out in são

228
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:33,360
joão you get living government one of

229
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:35,340
the advantages to take that process

230
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,860
approach with a lot of this but it helps

231
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:39,540
increase your maturity level so by that

232
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:41,400
I don't mean that okay this sounds like

233
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:44,010
was written by a kindergartner it means

234
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:46,250
like cmi capability maturity level

235
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:48,810
models that's worth noting which is a

236
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:51,180
scale that goes along with five once you

237
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:53,989
reach at least 11 3 it means pick your

238
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,989
stuff is well thought

239
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:13,859
interesting ok so before this guy I had

240
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:22,880
bye before this life clearly I didn't I

241
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:24,560
opened the primary cookies because my

242
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,950
notes just in case it didn't work I was

243
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,449
life is mom here so but why it is I

244
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:30,980
basically and when the slides available

245
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:32,630
and try to make sure i have my act

246
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:34,700
together enjoy the rank months ago sort

247
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:36,680
of ex lives with 11 cycle it was 12 just

248
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,780
be sort of a significant of what a

249
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:41,120
framework document would be this

250
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:42,980
framework Duncan had a larger current

251
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:48,710
section and that was broken down into

252
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:52,550
managerial operational so what I mean by

253
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:55,160
those are material goals are the ones

254
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:56,300
that you know somebody apartment in

255
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,719
today we're going to do you know

256
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:03,020
business in this they tend include

257
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,880
things like the main security plan

258
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:06,949
electronic resources plan how you can a

259
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,590
physical security to your risk

260
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:11,120
assessment instead of the information

261
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:15,910
security possible when we started

262
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,910
 what do I have four employees me

263
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:28,400
because all this stuff is kind of talks

264
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:33,260
pundits your response plan all that

265
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:36,800
stuff operational controls 10 feet ones

266
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:40,939
that are people so what what do I mean

267
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:43,040
by up every year we make our employees

268
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:45,800
signed off on some policies do some

269
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:48,709
basic training here's what they have to

270
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:51,260
do for changing management you know all

271
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:52,490
the things that are items that you tell

272
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:54,260
the people need you need to do this

273
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:56,630
business and what they're physically

274
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:58,490
doing as opposed to the nadir want to

275
00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:00,350
extend any much more policy room so it's

276
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:02,030
what we different to their technical

277
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:04,310
ones because they kind of go in the

278
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:07,490
hierarchy technical ones are your

279
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:08,630
hardware and software solutions so you

280
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:12,710
know we put in multi-factor

281
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:14,810
authentication as a technique be put in

282
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:17,170
n sort of just some random person angle

283
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:20,479
and thunder laptop into the network

284
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:22,550
Genentech split our things into those

285
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:27,590
three categories we start adding them in

286
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:28,699
overtime is fun which is against bigger

287
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:31,340
bigger

288
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:32,870
so then get six months pronounces what

289
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:34,880
do you know what he had in place for an

290
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:36,830
information security program I can't run

291
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,140
this one document it's just a few pages

292
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:41,150
long it was the Highlands as opposed to

293
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:44,360
be trying answer that question oh wow

294
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:45,560
you know we do a lot of stuff and I'm

295
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,850
trying to think of the top of my head

296
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,439
like what things i should say and

297
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:50,210
everything else it's not gonna sound

298
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:54,590
like you safe yeah here it is right here

299
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:57,110
and you get a far better impression okay

300
00:12:54,590 --> 00:13:00,470
Daisy major reason that I put this in

301
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:04,340
here it is one of these steaks that I've

302
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:07,070
seen people make and I'm including that

303
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:09,260
I've done before is that something

304
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:11,060
happens like this you bought picks up

305
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,530
magazines with the remaining to be free

306
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,599
fall street journal I read the most

307
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:17,300
feature every morning not because I find

308
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:19,010
it hopefully interesting but I know if

309
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:22,520
there's something in it as related to

310
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:24,800
security or risk with something else RM

311
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,600
console or make their cio for me to take

312
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,010
off you know what are we doing about

313
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:31,330
this to this is the most important

314
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:33,319
problem right now because i just read it

315
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:35,180
you know it's nothing in the world

316
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,770
because we have a lot usually we

317
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:38,959
currently do so i know it saying that

318
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:40,520
you know we should do this but here's

319
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,630
what we do instead or we already have

320
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,550
this initiative so you want to be a

321
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:45,170
little bit better than variable some of

322
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:47,240
those articles we use ground certainly

323
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:49,130
dealt convince your boss hey yeah you

324
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:51,440
know these five simple steps are going

325
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:53,540
to solve all of your problems and you're

326
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:57,080
not doing an addition it's not quite

327
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:58,490
that simple it was a lot of possible you

328
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,080
know II to be here because they just

329
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:02,230
would find a checklist and Peyton I

330
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:05,600
things on a checklist in what we're good

331
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:07,670
so when if you guys this is anything

332
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:12,220
gonna do this you know whatever happens

333
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:15,910
next that's that's up to you some basic

334
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:19,970
do's and don'ts if you tell your boss

335
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:22,310
does this crap it's not gonna it's not

336
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:25,760
gonna it's not gonna offer for you

337
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:27,290
wanted numbers ah don't say oh yeah

338
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,990
that's great I'll take that under

339
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:32,810
advisement and tell by my body language

340
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:34,160
that you know 30 seconds forget this

341
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:37,459
conversation I really don't care whose

342
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:39,199
them don't put you pause and say oh well

343
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,370
you know its best and this naturally

344
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,380
this is work with it

345
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:46,100
he doesn't want to have a technical

346
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:49,070
argument with you vomit so none of those

347
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:51,140
approaches really thin to health so but

348
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:53,660
I found it's far more effective to say

349
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:56,260
okay well you know that this is it two

350
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:58,550
different than what we're already doing

351
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:59,569
so we already do a lot of those steps

352
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:01,400
there might be some little God's

353
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:03,440
greatness what i can do is i can take

354
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,480
that list and had not prepared to offer

355
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,339
currently doing and whatever the deltas

356
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,350
are i'll send you love you know some of

357
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:11,360
the changes so the list accomplished is

358
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:13,190
a few things your boss feels like he

359
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,080
accomplished something so he's that

360
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:17,660
means going to be a little

361
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:21,140
problem your boss is going to stay home

362
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:23,689
halo this person looks like they're on

363
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:25,339
top of it and one of the reasons why

364
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:27,890
that perception is important is because

365
00:15:25,339 --> 00:15:29,390
not only it's true but generally have

366
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:31,819
your energy to get an unimaginable

367
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:35,029
illness but it's also important because

368
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:38,300
then later on when there's some question

369
00:15:35,029 --> 00:15:40,490
where your boss is getting two different

370
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,599
stories and he or she have to decide

371
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:43,580
whether or not they're gonna listen what

372
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:47,839
you're saying or what this marketing

373
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:50,300
person is saying because they hope hey

374
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,370
both i'm going to take this person's

375
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:55,219
word work because I trust is a hurricane

376
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:56,839
ian because these have been my other

377
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:59,000
experiences in the past I want to start

378
00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:00,529
building that rapport with people above

379
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,870
you because if you just tell them oh

380
00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:05,330
well thats dumb or no that's not what

381
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:07,339
we're doing for you start bagging if i

382
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:08,720
tell my boss why are you should or

383
00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:10,640
shouldn't use nanak getting started to

384
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,740
put a value on the wireless network this

385
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,939
uncle fluffy kind of isn't even if we

386
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:15,950
lock it down they can do spoil the

387
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:17,300
guests from starbucks and get here he is

388
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:19,010
a one hit up because one thing is not

389
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:21,020
going to understand immediately go on

390
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:23,209
the defensive and it's just not going to

391
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:25,520
end well so instead by doing it this way

392
00:16:23,209 --> 00:16:28,400
you still can work on stuff didn't want

393
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:30,770
to that you need to do but it's a little

394
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,810
bit of effort on your part and it will

395
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:34,930
help cement their relationship that make

396
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:34,930
sense

397
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:45,520
all right selecting a security framework

398
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:48,850
um one of the reasons that I put this in

399
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:51,340
here is not necessarily that I really

400
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:53,860
care which framework people use but you

401
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:58,210
should have one and the reason for doing

402
00:16:53,860 --> 00:17:01,150
that is that if you don't do people say

403
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:02,350
well you know how are you you know how

404
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:04,089
do you know which direction you're

405
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:08,310
taking things that are teaching them

406
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:11,829
well we're currently blind with da otha

407
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:13,540
so if they from well you know what are

408
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:15,579
we doing about this thing they were fall

409
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:19,690
in this business gamers as opposed to

410
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:21,220
this one now it becomes the discussion

411
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:22,650
of well you know is this greg from

412
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:25,180
framework who should be following

413
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:27,880
something else it makes much more sense

414
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:29,410
to have some lists that you can show

415
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,080
that direction and you're not just

416
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:33,820
making this stuff up as we go there are

417
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,919
some easier ones Prince in Sam's Club

418
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:38,830
money what's really nice about Sam's

419
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:41,290
 everybody here non Stanford so

420
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:44,860
what's nice about that is its entirety

421
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:47,200
so number one is more important than you

422
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:50,620
know number 20 so start up here you get

423
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:54,340
these basic ones down there yet later

424
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:59,080
you decide to align with the mists into

425
00:17:54,340 --> 00:18:01,659
the SP 800-53 it's everything that's in

426
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:03,820
there all the stuff from sams about 20

427
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:05,590
was still for that so if you've already

428
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:08,409
got the basic stuff your article to be

429
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:12,850
well on your way what's going to more

430
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:16,900
company or people that have to do stuff

431
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:20,020
in the UK cyprus angeles and if you look

432
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:22,870
up HMG cyber central blah blah blah

433
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:25,540
whatever the stigmas you can find same

434
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:27,159
thing it's very simple list it's even

435
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:30,460
small instead of 10 things it's actually

436
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:32,350
just same time but or anybody that

437
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:34,240
doesn't mean business in the UK they'll

438
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:36,219
want to know how fit you at those five

439
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,990
you need Pauls this and stuff list

440
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:41,380
things that directly address those

441
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:43,730
product is everybody happy it's also

442
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:46,310
some bigger ones

443
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:49,490
that this one I really thought few

444
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:51,139
minutes it's a little outline outline

445
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:52,340
just moves faster you kind of beat that

446
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:54,890
whole thing gets if you're having

447
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:57,129
trouble sleeping at night try reading

448
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:59,900
that document and it's and X things once

449
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:01,100
it's less than intuitive but it is a bit

450
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:06,470
standard and has a lot of things in

451
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:08,389
terms of guideline ISO 27001 i sting

452
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:12,230
about pets games specifically annex a

453
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:17,000
hideous that have images i doesn't been

454
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:18,560
a few it lists all well the 2007

455
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,970
versions electronic very frequent folks

456
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,530
is weighing their team just changing

457
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:25,310
around a little bit but basically just

458
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:27,320
shows a list of controls and if you take

459
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:28,429
that list from the annex and you say

460
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,500
okay with what do you do for this

461
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:32,630
control what we do for this control even

462
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,400
without one for the certification you

463
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:36,620
can sort of use it as a good checklist

464
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:42,830
to see how close you are before it's

465
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:46,909
aligning know so figure how do i need to

466
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:50,300
soften this is um the soft products on

467
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:54,080
offer fair members ssae 16 in the same

468
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:58,180
things those a genotype of slop is it

469
00:19:54,080 --> 00:20:00,439
not socks I can't believe the amount of

470
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:02,870
productivity that has been lost in

471
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,490
companies with Isaac's linkedin socket

472
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:05,989
it's locks the two totally different

473
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:08,080
things why on earth they had to put

474
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:11,390
those two names posts I have no idea and

475
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:13,129
it wastes a ton time I wasted per second

476
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:15,290
through this venture talk soon so

477
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:17,870
basically the song it shows that I had a

478
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:19,639
third party come in and I gave them my

479
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:22,280
list of controls whatever those controls

480
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:24,320
are and they judge the effectiveness of

481
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:27,320
those for Moltres tightness on to type

482
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:29,300
one for us on to type 2 would be will

483
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,889
see the effectiveness of those controls

484
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:34,639
or four time periods you have evidence

485
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:38,150
that you did this you say that you do in

486
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:40,970
a quarterly pods of your appear biggie

487
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:42,740
users well you know let me see for this

488
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:45,850
year I expect to see more reports and

489
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,850
reviews inside on something

490
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:55,970
all right establishing an information

491
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:57,830
security council so I touched on the

492
00:20:55,970 --> 00:21:00,710
slope it to start with this accomplished

493
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:02,750
this mini polls it's a good way to

494
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:05,030
engage the users on your initiative so

495
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:07,670
before you do something that's going to

496
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:10,129
potentially impact the users never guess

497
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:14,390
just how well is going to be received

498
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:17,690
and sometimes the reactions aren't

499
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:20,720
necessarily how you expected so for all

500
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:23,330
our phones of our themes to use that

501
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:26,480
confuse will be investor spell table if

502
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:28,669
you want to use your phone instead of a

503
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,200
company phone and you're going to have

504
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:32,120
manufactured upon it it has to be

505
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:35,140
included in our DM so we're going to

506
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:39,229
solve as ok plus people were part of it

507
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:41,330
then group too AirWatch worked a little

508
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:45,830
better what we doin everything a ton of

509
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:48,110
pushback you might guess why got a lot

510
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:53,360
of pushback on their watch where we'll

511
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:56,000
be really creative on Pez because I said

512
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:58,580
ear of watching it and everybody who

513
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,540
push backs at covel are you like a big

514
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:04,429
brother kind of thing are you guys older

515
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:06,530
I don't mean to do I can care less

516
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:08,780
you know that you're sending cat

517
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:11,120
pictures onto something I just want to

518
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:12,740
make sure of it our email that might be

519
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,090
on there and some other stuff I want to

520
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:17,420
make sure they're just put your old bike

521
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:19,429
that device I want to make sure that

522
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:21,140
your font some simple rules I want to

523
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:24,110
make sure that the device is encrypted I

524
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:25,790
want to make sure that you know haven't

525
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:27,560
asked photonic so I can just swipe that

526
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:31,310
unlocking it you know what everyone you

527
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:32,960
wanna um I had no idea that we're gonna

528
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:34,250
go put it back just because it was

529
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,960
something with the word watch and

530
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:38,030
everybody soon that was a big brother

531
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,830
despite people already haven't been on

532
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:42,440
there which was our previous and the

533
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:44,360
absolution look this way it is Henry

534
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:46,790
front that I've put security council at

535
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:49,070
first I'm going to notice that right

536
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:51,020
away than people patents reaction maybe

537
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:53,419
instead of saying the name of binoculars

538
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:55,870
visit or changing our MDM solution from

539
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,870
this

540
00:22:56,930 --> 00:23:00,540
another good thing about the security

541
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:03,300
program by the e Commission's very

542
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:08,670
console matter is that what's a new

543
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:10,080
students practice so but if it's true so

544
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:11,580
when someone's as well oh you know you

545
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,850
guys should really have information some

546
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:17,639
pretty fun so it's just one more

547
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:20,219
checklist so if somebody is basing your

548
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:23,310
posture on if you have these things done

549
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:26,850
say yes with that it would be like in

550
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:29,280
your framework document yes so it's just

551
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:32,340
a information for these guys or is it

552
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:35,970
important it depends how much your

553
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:40,470
questions answers so what way we run the

554
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:41,730
money if my company is we have a few

555
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:43,260
people and there are some of things that

556
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:44,940
are just going to be that economic

557
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:47,550
optional aight i want to let you guys

558
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:50,040
know this is what other ones we stay low

559
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:52,169
we want to do this these are some of the

560
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:54,930
concerns that big users might have or

561
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:58,110
what do you think you guys uses your

562
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:59,810
users would be concerned about so some

563
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:03,209
of them tend to be more democratic

564
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:07,830
approach some of them are more health

565
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:09,720
education so I try to leave the

566
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:12,179
discussions as open as I can for as many

567
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:14,310
things as I can because you get way

568
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:15,420
better flying in that way you say we're

569
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:17,850
going to do this remember this we're

570
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:20,520
going to do this it doesn't work as well

571
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:22,679
but if you present two solutions to

572
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:25,170
people and one on the left this is this

573
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:27,180
one of the rights of this one isn't one

574
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:28,290
nother month if they read this person a

575
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:31,290
lot of times people are going to pay

576
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:34,800
it's over here those little things you

577
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:37,770
can do to change people's and opinions

578
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:40,440
of things if you ask them to prioritize

579
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:42,000
a list of tasks I'm going to put them in

580
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:44,880
the order most important to least

581
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,430
important and has people prioritize this

582
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:50,340
because if I do that there are more

583
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:52,860
likely to take it in order this closer

584
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:54,240
to this as opposed to flipping it and if

585
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:56,399
you don't believe me just take you know

586
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,010
two groups of people flip it for the

587
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:02,550
least important on the conference and as

588
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:04,230
people we found this one before this one

589
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:05,820
so the station can do to influence

590
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:08,250
it's still giving people the ideas that

591
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:11,460
they're finding out letting you find out

592
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:16,980
but the morgue engage they feel the

593
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:18,450
better body that make sense in it keeps

594
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:23,880
the lot of folks happy because everybody

595
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:26,160
wants to see so you want to spend your

596
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:29,700
time on the changes that impact business

597
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:31,559
so if we're going to be in car linux

598
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,299
machine we had some old months of work

599
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:36,809
at five and i'm upgrading to red head

600
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:38,610
sticks we're so i'm not going to focus

601
00:25:36,809 --> 00:25:40,620
on that and focus on that work for

602
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:42,059
chanel multi-factor authentication that

603
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:44,010
we're doing other things that are going

604
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:45,570
to impact the users so if it's something

605
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:47,010
that happens in the background that

606
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:52,530
unless we screwed up they're not even

607
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:55,650
enough I'm not gonna bother those all

608
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:57,600
right instead response plan this is

609
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:59,010
important one to have this plane

610
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:03,080
templates out there and everything's we

611
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:05,610
can get something in place it has a

612
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:07,260
basic thing you know read on there that

613
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:08,909
you know it needs to have its purpose

614
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:12,570
you know what the scope of it is when

615
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:14,760
you should invoke it what your

616
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:20,159
definition is different people have

617
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:22,290
different impressions that up here you

618
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,940
want to mention that okay well any

619
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:28,559
incidents go before the information

620
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:29,700
security console oui chef incident

621
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,440
moment or so that when you know

622
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:34,049
something happens when people who's the

623
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,580
person that's in charge of this you have

624
00:26:34,049 --> 00:26:37,590
a response seemed so you want to kind of

625
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:39,899
starts to find all the stuff ahead of

626
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:43,439
time so that when there is that oh

627
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:44,669
moment but ok well what do we do here we

628
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,490
already kind of thought of nothing to

629
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:49,380
think of everything my crystal balls

630
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:51,540
been broken for good seven years now but

631
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:54,150
you can at least get part of the way

632
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:56,790
there and people are going to have a

633
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:58,410
better impression when you better okay

634
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:59,879
well yeah we had this issue blah blah

635
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:01,850
this is the person is in charge of the

636
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:04,110
incident these people have working on it

637
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:06,809
here's our evidence yet will refine gold

638
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:08,370
love it's a lot easier to have that in

639
00:27:06,809 --> 00:27:10,440
place ahead of time and try to figure

640
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:12,928
out what you should do what's your mind

641
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:16,400
off of this guy's mom one of the

642
00:27:12,929 --> 00:27:19,350
important things we should have in this

643
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:21,930
because when this all kinds of things

644
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:27,899
weren't wrong you don't get me take with

645
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:28,920
very good notes that we study have you

646
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:31,680
running around with my hair on fire

647
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:34,440
butthead here there was something going

648
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:36,510
wrong but yeah isn't Gary template that

649
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,980
says okay mom you know what's the date

650
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:39,660
and time has happened you know who

651
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:41,970
reported the problem who's the person is

652
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:44,370
documenting this you know what's the

653
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:45,690
severity lists have other definitions

654
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:47,820
that you put in the head of terms of

655
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:52,740
people you know decide what was the very

656
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:54,240
ism what steps we've taken in all the

657
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:57,270
other and I go and beat them all over

658
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,470
the Kendall's and everybody dirty you

659
00:27:57,270 --> 00:28:00,810
should do a conference room pilot at

660
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:02,760
some point which is that you get a few

661
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:03,810
people together from baby news on one of

662
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:06,090
your information security council

663
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:08,610
meeting said okay we're going to test

664
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:10,800
this so let's say is happen you know if

665
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:13,199
so-and-so just reported evasive and

666
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:17,550
email to remember in the emulation

667
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:19,800
deposition how would we handle and what

668
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:22,080
that does is when you go from magical

669
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,639
exercise is there's often some

670
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:28,439
unforeseen things they should expect

671
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:31,500
when a disaster recovery conferencing

672
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:33,330
pilot and you've got everybody together

673
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:35,250
was that okay well it's too distant so

674
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:37,379
we pick the scenario out hands over

675
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:40,290
towards maybe but advanced it okay well

676
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:44,130
this happened oh we need to talk to the

677
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:47,730
facilities guy going to college man in

678
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:49,470
its responding on the line moves kid we

679
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:51,870
call my cell phone we didn't get her

680
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:54,720
cell phone they would call his home

681
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:56,399
phone you get into his home phone not

682
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,710
sure why it was a part that day I don't

683
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:01,670
know if he was a sighting somewhere

684
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:03,810
where every this one okay mall not one

685
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:08,550
guy said well why don't we just pick

686
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:10,260
another scenario I think this happened

687
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:12,300
in real life and we couldn't get in

688
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:15,660
charge we can get in touch with Steve

689
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:18,270
you know what should we do like a we

690
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:21,560
spent the next 15 minutes arguing about

691
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:24,780
who we should call back it was kind of

692
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:26,220
but I was in a position to enclose

693
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:28,340
everybody's a lot of people higher on

694
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:31,789
the routine so I can tell the CEO

695
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:35,149
to really then how about we just talked

696
00:29:31,789 --> 00:29:37,070
with a person so we eventually figured

697
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:39,470
out you know who the next person feet

698
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:41,090
and then one of our next steps was that

699
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:43,490
okay for of all the people who are

700
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:46,010
listed on our bevels of the argument

701
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:48,140
with a lot of Thomas's name if you don't

702
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:50,360
meet this person you know maybe wait the

703
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:52,760
half hour and itself up reaching that

704
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:54,889
you talked to this person if it's this

705
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:57,169
type of issue and are you trying to

706
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:59,179
reach out to him over here this is next

707
00:29:57,169 --> 00:30:03,289
person so it was a change with me based

708
00:29:59,179 --> 00:30:06,140
on time you want to continually improve

709
00:30:03,289 --> 00:30:07,879
this based on observations you made you

710
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:10,190
want to fact your attention is really

711
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:13,309
very keen on scope you can change to

712
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:15,279
this one man you want to let you wanna

713
00:30:13,309 --> 00:30:17,720
make sure that everybody knows about

714
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:20,559
policies everybody loves policies right

715
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:22,399
that's what you get live for me

716
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:24,110
unfortunately they aren't kind of

717
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:26,600
important you can buy guidance and

718
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:29,809
fabrications key areas it enforces your

719
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:32,289
organization's of a profound issues we

720
00:30:29,809 --> 00:30:34,549
put together an active shooter policy

721
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:37,820
it's kind of awesome didn't one think

722
00:30:34,549 --> 00:30:41,299
about it but after tending and talk we

723
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:42,649
can regard me with the gathers at the

724
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:46,399
time was the head of the Connecticut

725
00:30:42,649 --> 00:30:48,850
State Police he mentioned his things in

726
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:54,770
terms of what happened with the whole

727
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:56,899
example how that it was a tough speech

728
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:58,970
to get through because it was obviously

729
00:30:56,899 --> 00:31:00,229
tuck frump this even years later he was

730
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:02,720
going to be looking at his news talking

731
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:04,100
different been in talks about this but

732
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:08,090
one of the things that he didn't come on

733
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:10,939
was they the whole thing city folks over

734
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:13,039
in less than four minutes none of the

735
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:14,179
speed roofers were there by the time

736
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,919
they got there the whole thing is over

737
00:31:14,179 --> 00:31:17,630
who's done with but nobody you can

738
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:19,700
because they just stopped their disco

739
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:21,409
finding assessments going on so they

740
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:23,299
send people into clear the building and

741
00:31:21,409 --> 00:31:25,549
everything else would not be any column

742
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:28,879
is that anybody who went into that

743
00:31:25,549 --> 00:31:32,179
building was useless for the next eight

744
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:35,320
days based on what they seem so he lost

745
00:31:32,179 --> 00:31:37,510
the temporary you temporarily lost

746
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:40,169
three-quarters of this people

747
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:43,690
anybody that had been exposed to that

748
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:45,790
they they were useless and I think in

749
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:47,350
the end that if I hitherto you know but

750
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:50,110
it happened on that day I wouldn't even

751
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:52,840
work so things like this you just had

752
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:55,389
even just don't think of those kind of

753
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:57,970
things so it was interesting to get that

754
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:59,890
perspective zone it's important to put

755
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:01,900
policies together figure out you know

756
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:03,790
what do we do with things and it also

757
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:06,010
shows that you have better maturity

758
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:09,610
level beginning for whatever you're

759
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:11,730
doing there's one other thing too much

760
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:13,899
was check with your HR dept legal

761
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:16,720
there's there's two types of policies

762
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:19,150
there's policies that are the capital P

763
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,660
policy and create liability for your

764
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:23,980
company so even though it's if you

765
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:28,330
created a working home pulse against it

766
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:32,130
oh you can only work come home if you do

767
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:34,840
this this in the range for challenger I

768
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:37,270
saw that in the companies working on

769
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:40,060
policy which is a oral facial put in the

770
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:42,970
policy because now you safe okay both

771
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:44,080
people that have kids I'm putting them

772
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:48,720
in a different pocket than everybody

773
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:51,010
else as soon as the HR person saw that

774
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:55,450
is it okay if you take that out I'll be

775
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:56,740
obviously with letting up so there can

776
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:57,970
you just have to be careful when you're

777
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:59,860
right at all since everything else that

778
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:01,570
you want to make sure that your HR legal

779
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:06,370
department can take them up to make sure

780
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:07,899
that it'll be stays on you should also

781
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:10,090
have a central repository for things

782
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:11,440
because you want to just have to be

783
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:14,379
anything fancy rsb through the

784
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:16,330
sharepoint page and there's a little bit

785
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:19,450
of metadata that has the basin for all

786
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:21,100
of them that they were last review so as

787
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:23,410
soon as it comes close to the date of

788
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:25,209
its been a year something goes through a

789
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:27,010
look and see who the owner is it can

790
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:28,600
sense with that person hey you need to

791
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:30,790
review this again so what are you get in

792
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:34,399
time people look at all our policies you

793
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:38,200
see that they halted recruit or you

794
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:38,200
in the last year

795
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:43,680
changement

796
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:50,049
the last legs of different ideas you

797
00:33:48,549 --> 00:33:51,970
might they do it so i'll see ya hair

798
00:33:50,049 --> 00:33:53,559
proof in here on this coffee just i

799
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:57,519
pulled up an older couple my size

800
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:58,928
unfortunately so the first time this is

801
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:00,640
you know why is included here change

802
00:33:58,929 --> 00:34:04,990
management really doesn't sound you know

803
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:07,690
milega security well for one especially

804
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:11,290
if you have customers that are regulated

805
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:16,030
industry patient care so if I company we

806
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:18,040
do a lot of long work with banks they

807
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:20,109
are obviously heavily regulated so

808
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:22,570
before they are willing to use our

809
00:34:20,109 --> 00:34:29,589
services they want to make sure that our

810
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:31,149
 together Terry so if I don't have a

811
00:34:29,589 --> 00:34:32,889
mature change management program

812
00:34:31,149 --> 00:34:33,909
placement okay here's how we handle

813
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:36,070
stuff is what's in our production

814
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:38,200
environments here's how it home for the

815
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:40,389
year here here's how we do conservation

816
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:43,658
movies we don't have all those it's

817
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:45,580
going to be a big check mark against us

818
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:47,619
in terms of whether or not they decide

819
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:50,710
that our security standards and are

820
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:53,290
where they need to be and also auditors

821
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:55,210
doesn't care about it not a big fan of

822
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:57,279
auditing clip inside necessarily evil

823
00:34:55,210 --> 00:35:03,790
it's going to be here it's not going to

824
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:06,339
go away so so the crucial take away from

825
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:07,810
this legend gets the only ones here if

826
00:35:06,339 --> 00:35:09,910
you could see my points the most

827
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:11,740
important one on there would be that

828
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:14,680
it's not the specific tool in

829
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:16,180
methodology it uses its the process if

830
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:18,339
you have a process in place and that

831
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:20,109
process is documented you have evidence

832
00:35:18,339 --> 00:35:22,359
that you follow that process the way

833
00:35:20,109 --> 00:35:25,359
that documented that is far more

834
00:35:22,359 --> 00:35:27,790
important than which tool we use so if

835
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:29,619
you have a cracking process someone says

836
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:31,990
hey just buy this new tool and all your

837
00:35:29,619 --> 00:35:35,020
hopes of itself you can probably fix it

838
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:37,560
if you just take care of the process the

839
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:37,560
operational

840
00:35:40,589 --> 00:35:45,819
I did it's awesome bullets and

841
00:35:44,289 --> 00:35:47,530
everything I had comments below but

842
00:35:45,819 --> 00:35:48,849
guess not on that one so I didn't see

843
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:53,049
because you hear my witness right there

844
00:35:48,849 --> 00:35:55,059
I basically talked about why it's

845
00:35:53,049 --> 00:35:57,270
included like clients with care how

846
00:35:55,059 --> 00:36:01,890
process is more important software you

847
00:35:57,270 --> 00:36:01,890
looking for process communication all

848
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:09,670
right all right vulnerability management

849
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:10,960
to stuff like that might be one of these

850
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:12,700
don't do the slides the night before

851
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,950
maybe give myself with more runway mess

852
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:16,359
it up what a building management is

853
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:17,919
another light on a mission being that

854
00:36:16,359 --> 00:36:19,808
mainframe we're talking to talk about

855
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,039
but it should also definitely this is

856
00:36:19,809 --> 00:36:24,069
one of the first ones it needs to happen

857
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:26,200
to dedicate that because but are duly

858
00:36:24,069 --> 00:36:28,058
scanning knows what that is

859
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:32,230
environmental management harnesses love

860
00:36:28,059 --> 00:36:34,750
the same things so for a while before i

861
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:38,470
started the company mmm they had armful

862
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:39,940
of skinning place great so when I can i

863
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:42,520
call ya can you show me their equipment

864
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:44,410
yeah i think we never put here and I saw

865
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:47,170
this mailbox where they had been sending

866
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:49,720
amelie and apparently for the past 18

867
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:51,700
months every month if emailed this

868
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:54,118
report this mailbox that nobody really

869
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:57,939
looked at and their ports never changed

870
00:36:54,119 --> 00:37:02,589
because gaming and it had hundreds of

871
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:04,510
our village listed but so they were too

872
00:37:02,589 --> 00:37:06,339
abundantly scanning we could check about

873
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:09,609
you know that checkbox our foods

874
00:37:06,339 --> 00:37:11,200
nomination okay let's look at the ones

875
00:37:09,609 --> 00:37:14,500
that are we'll just start it really

876
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:16,750
basic sort of icds esco okay so all

877
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:18,970
these ones that we have better tens that

878
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:21,430
are on external systems that our system

879
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:24,459
really care about how about we start

880
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:26,020
working on loans first so we took care

881
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:28,150
of those did you knock out some of the

882
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:30,670
high-risk one some of the lowest ones

883
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:32,920
away as well and then once we finish

884
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:35,230
that we read the same skin again to make

885
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:37,900
sure that they need went away there is

886
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:40,180
no pain now that goes the fun way what

887
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:42,339
are the next highest and then we just

888
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:43,899
list and then we put together a

889
00:37:42,339 --> 00:37:48,700
management document that kind of listed

890
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:51,220
on that's what we do so I would say that

891
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:53,859
a good funding management process is

892
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:55,000
even more important than having a good

893
00:37:53,859 --> 00:37:59,130
tool it's great type of the coop

894
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:04,020
definitely should have one there but if

895
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:05,700
all things being equal to process and to

896
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:09,250
talk about finding vulnerabilities

897
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:11,919
prioritize based on NASA criticality how

898
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:13,900
it supports on things some people take

899
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,640
any private either publicly expertly

900
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:17,020
either a year but it's a

901
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:19,328
one-in-a-million thing to be able to

902
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:23,099
work this one anybody who has a copy of

903
00:38:19,329 --> 00:38:23,099
metasploit can you know wanted like that

904
00:38:23,309 --> 00:38:29,920
there's also some benefit to change the

905
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:31,869
scanners every few years so fun that we

906
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:36,550
were using connivance mention those

907
00:38:31,869 --> 00:38:38,650
under because there's no two tools are

908
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:40,569
going to scan get exactly ed one tool

909
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:42,250
thanks for looking pretty welcome went

910
00:38:40,569 --> 00:38:45,730
to another tool and it immediately found

911
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:51,130
that we had a alta password on a draft

912
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:53,380
card for certain told them you know this

913
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:56,200
can't possibly even you know scanning

914
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:57,520
this couldn't possibly have this so i

915
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,960
looked at it said it was on a certain

916
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,940
server so well the track power tools

917
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,619
aren't used to it it's just um it's

918
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:04,210
remote access card so difficult are

919
00:39:02,619 --> 00:39:08,890
hanged up and it's a dolly reported this

920
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:13,809
card so in approval I know what the

921
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:17,670
password was record button up which that

922
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:17,670
server I design under the driver

923
00:39:18,779 --> 00:39:22,299
riku Deckard with all these things I

924
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:25,689
Camilla server that I should have no

925
00:39:22,299 --> 00:39:27,339
access to the screenshot of it sent it

926
00:39:25,689 --> 00:39:29,618
to one of our sysadmin since I hate

927
00:39:27,339 --> 00:39:32,049
should I be able to see this and what

928
00:39:29,619 --> 00:39:36,729
happens if i click this fun speed-wise

929
00:39:32,049 --> 00:39:39,069
aspas so he freaked out about a little

930
00:39:36,729 --> 00:39:41,140
bit and clear didn't short understand

931
00:39:39,069 --> 00:39:45,699
phrasal it is a good idea to change

932
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:46,629
every once a while because of just

933
00:39:45,699 --> 00:39:48,369
because they're not always going to

934
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:49,569
catch the same thing some buttons are

935
00:39:48,369 --> 00:39:52,299
these scanners are really going to care

936
00:39:49,569 --> 00:39:55,749
about ssl stuff other ones are really

937
00:39:52,299 --> 00:39:58,239
going to care about you know some older

938
00:39:55,749 --> 00:40:04,149
tool so i'm switching everyone's why

939
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:08,890
he's doing better chance okay

940
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:12,249
housekeeping they'll get a lot of this

941
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:13,868
comes down to the process it's really a

942
00:40:12,249 --> 00:40:18,848
good idea to list out what you should do

943
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:21,309
monthly quarterly and if you can't right

944
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:23,439
now point me to a playwriting what are

945
00:40:21,309 --> 00:40:26,859
all the security related things that you

946
00:40:23,439 --> 00:40:28,808
guys do what's important now everybody

947
00:40:26,859 --> 00:40:31,209
knows kind of a little bit i do this

948
00:40:28,809 --> 00:40:33,130
like this and you know Susie doesn't saw

949
00:40:31,209 --> 00:40:37,019
the bank into it there should be a list

950
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:38,859
that says for security blade items

951
00:40:37,019 --> 00:40:42,488
here's a list of everything you

952
00:40:38,859 --> 00:40:44,999
cordially here's where they are in 15

953
00:40:42,489 --> 00:40:47,709
evidence of where it was done last order

954
00:40:44,999 --> 00:40:50,819
because what happens is over time

955
00:40:47,709 --> 00:40:56,828
there's some requiring oh you need to be

956
00:40:50,819 --> 00:40:59,009
reviewing this list quarterly wait that

957
00:40:56,829 --> 00:41:01,810
was a neat

958
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:09,880
it's okay where are you on slide 14 so

959
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:19,360
i'll just have to verify you know that's

960
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:26,080
why I headaches it right over here okay

961
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:27,880
all right on it is if you have a list

962
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:29,080
then when you get some new requirement

963
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:31,060
and who you have to start doing this

964
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:33,100
quarterly and then this person was one

965
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:34,750
quarter and then we forget about it and

966
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:36,339
then a year goes by and then the client

967
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:38,800
that asking that says we need to do this

968
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:41,020
Alison you're scrambling because you

969
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,480
have no inning bottom boat lifts that

970
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:44,620
you've actually been do it when you say

971
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,780
and the personal creations what may be

972
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:48,100
done for another job and when is job

973
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:50,080
transitioning it's like oh by the way

974
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:52,120
you have to do this in two months so

975
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,500
again if you have a process and you have

976
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:55,990
some lists where you have all these

977
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:58,000
items then it becomes really easy to

978
00:41:55,990 --> 00:42:01,390
when you get into one you just add it to

979
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:05,230
the same lesson again we put ours in the

980
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:06,549
simples sharepoint page if you pick the

981
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:08,860
drop down load it shows that it's

982
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:13,290
importantly it looks the last time it

983
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:16,210
was done as 13 and 90 days in once sisty

984
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:17,850
changes based on that one that I did was

985
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:20,260
ripped hey you need to do this one again

986
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:22,450
it's what everyone smile on that page

987
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:24,460
requires the four bugs that need to do

988
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:28,020
it I can see whether or not things are

989
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:30,160
done in which things will work it up up

990
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:35,140
it also provides interpreting the

991
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:38,290
mechanism for this printer the idea for

992
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:39,910
this register is conquered check the

993
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:41,680
fridge which is the set of transactions

994
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:44,440
over you're walking down the hall lane

995
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:46,270
ok this is intriguing he did you know

996
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:47,530
that on the 25th floor I know you never

997
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:48,700
go of their vision with your buddies

998
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:50,620
with people on the floor there the

999
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:54,850
purpose you don't like but it hosts if

1000
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:57,190
your problem is sort of the midnight you

1001
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:59,170
shouldn't give you enough so i think the

1002
00:42:57,190 --> 00:43:01,990
walkway just kind of realize you know

1003
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:03,730
worth it I've I should add that so I'll

1004
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:05,200
add that as one of the items to the risk

1005
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:06,520
factor for me you know we have this

1006
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,230
problem where people tend to do this

1007
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:09,759
because mocking solid right in there

1008
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:12,700
there's a lot of problems that we just

1009
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,990
end up in my room ah you know then the

1010
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:15,399
people at night you know this guy who

1011
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:17,589
always tailgates because he never

1012
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:19,330
remember that so rather than just did

1013
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:22,150
hire the problems i'm going to list it

1014
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:24,310
in there put in whether this is you know

1015
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:25,690
a critical thing but it's a look okay

1016
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:28,660
today market something that I'm not too

1017
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:30,670
worried about who really needs to take

1018
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:32,890
care of this and then what pays it is

1019
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:34,060
sometimes just identified by a whole

1020
00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:36,100
bunch of identify things to my

1021
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:37,869
whispering things identify to have them

1022
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:40,990
anything with I don't think they're

1023
00:43:37,869 --> 00:43:42,490
going to forget about it or is it

1024
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:44,589
something that I'm actively working on

1025
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:45,939
the be meeting or husband completed

1026
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:47,770
what's this one thing if I'm right there

1027
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:49,840
it drops off that list but I still have

1028
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:52,380
a separate view magazine okay these are

1029
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:55,060
all the risk that we identified in part

1030
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:57,160
it's not that hard to put together if

1031
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:58,900
you require some really complicated to

1032
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:08,200
Auburn very high chair funding to being

1033
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:11,020
simple patient can become so you can put

1034
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:12,939
this whole thing you know what a misc

1035
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:16,480
assessment we currently do those it

1036
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:18,310
those are kind of important right so you

1037
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:22,270
know what do I do now well look at what

1038
00:44:18,310 --> 00:44:26,170
we already have in place if you don't

1039
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:27,960
have a risk assessment it's kind of an

1040
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:30,160
important thing that we should have um

1041
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:33,010
otherwise we're already doing it we'll

1042
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:35,529
just add it to the fragrant document but

1043
00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:37,840
it gave you a list assessments and

1044
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:39,550
here's how we ba ba this is what we need

1045
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:42,460
to remediate these are the people that

1046
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:43,960
care about it all it's them so you put a

1047
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:46,930
 me together that says what you do

1048
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:49,650
for risk assessment where the copy is

1049
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:52,330
emphatic assessment you add an item into

1050
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:56,140
that frame are fun so at this point

1051
00:44:52,330 --> 00:44:57,460
we're putting on sensitivity so if you

1052
00:44:56,140 --> 00:45:00,100
start to publish to get a lot more

1053
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:02,109
organized and then next time they ask me

1054
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:05,670
what we do for security one of the items

1055
00:45:02,109 --> 00:45:05,670
is going to get our under control

1056
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:11,780
is that what it was a name that now we

1057
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:16,160
have a mature well defined for people

1058
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:18,590
process look at that we made it through

1059
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:23,950
I was talking to do it in like 45

1060
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:29,450
minutes under contract so me stay with

1061
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:30,560
anybody any questions yes you were

1062
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:32,270
saying like sometimes if you have

1063
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:35,090
clients who retired if you have certain

1064
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:38,090
policy itself so do you have like a

1065
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:39,980
general letter or smaller list of your

1066
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:42,110
policy for will you give them a cocky

1067
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:44,570
little pulses or do you just sort of

1068
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:46,850
give them a check box yes we do so the

1069
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:50,390
short answer is it depends largely

1070
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:52,700
answer is that I keep two pages vitual

1071
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:54,379
list of our policies one that shows our

1072
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:58,310
public policies that everybody cares

1073
00:45:54,380 --> 00:46:00,320
about on the eight hrs items because our

1074
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:02,960
employees fear about work from Allah

1075
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:04,900
sick time benefits do other things maybe

1076
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:08,330
one or two of the security really wants

1077
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:10,730
invader list that's the ones that tend

1078
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:13,040
to be more IT focus that only certain

1079
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:16,640
people in nineteen careful so what we do

1080
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:18,950
come on management key management stuff

1081
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:22,839
like that the average person Suzie

1082
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:25,759
Natalia does not care about how I handle

1083
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:29,240
not Richie so we keep all these in a

1084
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:31,490
separate kinda in addition to

1085
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:33,049
that we make sure that they're all

1086
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:41,089
standardized which one has the same kind

1087
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:44,540
of header so I and then also in terms of

1088
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:45,740
what not willing to give to find some of

1089
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:47,390
them just want to know when yes or no

1090
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:50,299
other ones they want a little boring

1091
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:52,670
answer so one thing that I've had a fun

1092
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:54,910
way the future their excessive simply

1093
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:58,010
spreadsheet I answer all the questions

1094
00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:59,509
and they try to just put little answers

1095
00:46:58,010 --> 00:47:02,330
to whatever application they have

1096
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:03,560
something on the answer but each policy

1097
00:47:02,330 --> 00:47:04,670
found a statement that basically

1098
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:06,920
references it

1099
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:10,460
you're happy i won say well I want to

1100
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:13,339
see your incident was constantly so talk

1101
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:14,510
to the absolutely not there's no way

1102
00:47:13,339 --> 00:47:17,450
we're going to share that we have four

1103
00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:19,730
tidings of Paola ok so we reach the

1104
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:21,890
evenings for now editions kind of knife

1105
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:23,990
isn't responsible in every time we make

1106
00:47:21,890 --> 00:47:27,410
a change to it I take the first two

1107
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:29,808
pages title page their vision page the

1108
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:31,490
table of contents and the furnace only

1109
00:47:29,809 --> 00:47:34,460
goes up that fires feels like a person

1110
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:36,618
or five pages I take a PDF of that men

1111
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:38,540
keep their zone they say we need to see

1112
00:47:36,619 --> 00:47:41,089
if it's in response well we can't share

1113
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:42,558
them what i can do is give you the

1114
00:47:41,089 --> 00:47:45,529
snippet that shows the first few pages

1115
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:47,059
so they look at it in the table contents

1116
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:48,500
you can see all the sections even know

1117
00:47:47,059 --> 00:47:50,780
if i'm giving away too far in terms of

1118
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:52,520
exactly what we do that's enough to make

1119
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:54,650
you happy yes ok they have oh it's a

1120
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:56,180
responsibility tell that it's you know

1121
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:57,470
put out I can tell it as a template i

1122
00:47:56,180 --> 00:48:00,589
can see it they have a post-mortem

1123
00:47:57,470 --> 00:48:05,240
sexually i really care about ok good so

1124
00:48:00,589 --> 00:48:07,549
usually that combinations yes if I'm

1125
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:10,189
that worked a lot of things and you deal

1126
00:48:07,549 --> 00:48:14,500
with their regulators there the wirings

1127
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:19,970
whether there's an interaction ok so

1128
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:22,670
yeah nice to their hopefully regulated

1129
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:24,950
so one of the things that give if your

1130
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:27,109
bank and have all this data and you want

1131
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:30,109
to put in like 88 is it a terabyte of

1132
00:48:27,109 --> 00:48:31,520
data and I want you guys to analyze this

1133
00:48:30,109 --> 00:48:34,009
and figure out what we're doing with

1134
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:35,660
this and then you'll Phillips pops of

1135
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:37,819
money on top of the great based on you

1136
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:39,649
know you're finding lots of before you

1137
00:48:37,819 --> 00:48:41,390
have to get to the security system

1138
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:44,540
because one of their pockets that they

1139
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:50,058
will have is be properly that third

1140
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:52,069
point so I have a kind of common list of

1141
00:48:50,059 --> 00:48:54,260
things that we know that they're going

1142
00:48:52,069 --> 00:48:56,359
to ask the word about everybody asks for

1143
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:58,730
the exact same things but it's been

1144
00:48:56,359 --> 00:48:59,960
followed in a certain category so a lot

1145
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:02,599
are going to ask about my incident

1146
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:04,190
response plan as we loaded dr plan

1147
00:49:02,599 --> 00:49:06,470
that's what i do in terms of

1148
00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:08,390
all informations agree again if you have

1149
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:10,160
that one very much document that goes a

1150
00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:14,060
long way because that's not 28 in

1151
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:17,029
specifics so I still usually build most

1152
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:19,099
of the expectations that the bank would

1153
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:22,670
have by having those documents without

1154
00:49:19,099 --> 00:49:25,760
giving away on the eternal confidential

1155
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:29,260
information that area it's almost Alaska

1156
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:33,589
efficiently copy of your last pendant or

1157
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:35,510
your lady's modern release no no because

1158
00:49:33,589 --> 00:49:37,250
if I give you that what a basic thing

1159
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:40,339
you would say if you want to have this

1160
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:41,780
this is exactly where you should go so

1161
00:49:40,339 --> 00:49:45,560
no I'm not going to what it will share

1162
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:48,859
with you is that ok um here's our latest

1163
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:51,140
mediation report these are abilities

1164
00:49:48,859 --> 00:49:52,970
you're on this dating this was their

1165
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:55,460
aging it's what we did to remediate them

1166
00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:58,189
so you know that we have a plan together

1167
00:49:55,460 --> 00:50:00,170
and i'll give the vulnerability

1168
00:49:58,190 --> 00:50:01,490
management but i'm going to i'm not

1169
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:05,780
going to go and show you a copy of our

1170
00:50:01,490 --> 00:50:07,459
latest pentester latest because I don't

1171
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:10,460
want anybody say okay what the one that

1172
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:12,430
is this an executive agency so I run a

1173
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:16,430
question ed around security awareness

1174
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:18,319
your treatment is a few things on what

1175
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:21,770
we found for secure to listen to things

1176
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:26,150
on fishing nobody wants to listen to me

1177
00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:28,450
apparently um so rather than just really

1178
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:30,349
boring training their first examples is

1179
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:31,759
officially more appropriate fish me

1180
00:50:30,349 --> 00:50:33,829
which is great if you put together this

1181
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:36,170
simple vision campaign it goes off to

1182
00:50:33,829 --> 00:50:38,390
everybody okay click on here to give me

1183
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:40,339
bonds or whatever somebody clicks on

1184
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:41,960
something they shouldn't and it breaks

1185
00:50:40,339 --> 00:50:44,029
up a training page that's branded with

1186
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:45,349
our goal goals as my name on it so that

1187
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:47,810
they know that this is something which

1188
00:50:45,349 --> 00:50:50,690
is this was the fishing exercise here's

1189
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:52,730
how you should have known that it wasn't

1190
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:56,240
something to look at the email address

1191
00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:57,829
it's the wrong it says you know this

1192
00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:01,759
club when you mouse over it actually as

1193
00:50:57,829 --> 00:51:03,349
entirely different URL we're better than

1194
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:05,089
this in grammar you know whatever the

1195
00:51:03,349 --> 00:51:07,880
piece so we'll find out all the things

1196
00:51:05,089 --> 00:51:10,150
that are wrong with it and the first few

1197
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:13,170
people that report it as fishing

1198
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:15,380
expensive about nice info

1199
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:18,210
my signature on a free to all the one

1200
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:19,920
what attached to speech missions and

1201
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:21,390
makes it into the first five people

1202
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:24,510
don't realize it's a problem and that

1203
00:51:21,390 --> 00:51:28,379
has worked far better our initial rates

1204
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:31,680
with when people click on a fish to

1205
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:32,940
stagnate so that means that one out of

1206
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:35,279
every three is going to fall for

1207
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:38,309
something stupid if something that leads

1208
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:42,780
it to that person now we're down into

1209
00:51:38,309 --> 00:51:45,150
the single digits so that's not worked

1210
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:47,819
out pretty well the other thing is your

1211
00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:49,559
training resistance urged as they pierce

1212
00:51:47,819 --> 00:51:52,790
everything I know about fishing and I'm

1213
00:51:49,559 --> 00:51:56,220
going to try to tell that to everybody

1214
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:59,190
you don't want to know everything so for

1215
00:51:56,220 --> 00:52:00,990
any given subject which one take two or

1216
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:03,630
three senses I probably say two

1217
00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:06,240
sentences to everybody about this

1218
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:09,240
subject whatever it is you know public

1219
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:11,339
Wi-Fi fishing whatever it is get two

1220
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:14,359
sentences and then on a creative way to

1221
00:52:11,339 --> 00:52:19,680
get those two sentences of information

1222
00:52:14,359 --> 00:52:22,680
okay you know whatever we need really

1223
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:26,250
simple cartoon characters so we have a

1224
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:28,348
dodo bird good try to picture me go to

1225
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:32,160
work and if the bottom of pages is

1226
00:52:28,349 --> 00:52:33,599
Dunkey photo and now once a month we

1227
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:35,970
send out some kind of training that's on

1228
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:37,829
something again very very line and at

1229
00:52:35,970 --> 00:52:41,220
the bottom which one it says don't you

1230
00:52:37,829 --> 00:52:43,079
go to and people have bought that and

1231
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:45,089
you'd be surprised over time not only do

1232
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:46,650
they recognize now that they're kind of

1233
00:52:45,089 --> 00:52:49,859
getting all of those trainings together

1234
00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:53,220
but it's very simple training short you

1235
00:52:49,859 --> 00:52:57,450
don't want to hear it very simple and

1236
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:59,450
you're better off having a higher higher

1237
00:52:57,450 --> 00:53:07,270
inception waiting for one of your senses

1238
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:10,270
over sent me yes

1239
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:10,270
perfectly
