all right kids did a great job giving do

24
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:22,089
my intro I'm a senior security because

25
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:24,340
security consulting with VSR which is

26

also part of NCT group this is all ass

27
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:28,300
tonight I'm around I'm not really going

28
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:30,250
to George bio someone discussed some

29
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,270
stuff about you know my life feel a

30
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,470
little bit further on but I normally

31
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:36,850
wouldn't get into in a normal

32
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:39,820
presentation so what we already up to

33
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:41,169
back like when we used to turn mentor

34
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,669
like what are we actually talking about

35
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:44,950
right and I want to discuss a lot of

36
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,720
like this kind of term because they

37
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:48,520
might talk into the relationship that

38
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,800
Keith and I have is kind of a more

39
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:53,080
formalized relationship than somebody is

40
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,840
a friend but mentor originally comes

41
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:58,570
from Odyssey and it was an actual name

42
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,550
of the guy that leaves of Telemachus his

43
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:02,770
teacher and tamarcus was the son of

44
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:05,590
Odysseus and Odysseus went off to war

45
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:07,090
left him with mentor and over time the

46
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:08,860
word mentors evolved to meet a trusted

47
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,200
advisor a friend teacher for your wise

48
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,549
person and that's where it actually

49
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:21,190
comes from now I thought that's kind of

50
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:23,610
interesting that I know that what sure

51
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,609
was not

52
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:39,220
yeah this word like keys aren't working

53
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:42,510
either oh that's

54
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,510
I'm sorry falling here

55
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:58,480
no it's furries my Internet's keeps

56
00:02:52,810 --> 00:03:00,690
going out that's nothing that's not the

57
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,690
clicker

58
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:13,839
all right the downloaded version um so

59
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:16,299
my inspiration for this talk is that

60
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,410
throughout my life I always essentially

61
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,820
where I am today

62
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:21,250
not because of Education not because of

63
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:23,739
you know certain jobs and like that but

64
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:27,580
because of the people I've met who have

65
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:29,050
encouraged me to do things and some of

66
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,850
these people have been you know it drove

67
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,720
my life you know for decades if not

68
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:34,090
longer

69
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:36,090
some have been pleading for maybe a year

70
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:40,120
or two and don't keep in contact anymore

71
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:41,620
but I felt a lot of them and I want to

72
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,540
you know essentially share my knowledge

73
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:46,240
and experience and to solidify them own

74
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:48,160
knowledge and I think that is a very

75
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:52,570
valuable way of doing it is by helping

76
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:56,170
other people learn and grow so some of

77
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:58,180
my highlights of being mentored is you

78
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:00,609
know I initially I never had any

79
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,800
intention going to college in high

80
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:03,880
school I was a musician and playing a

81
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,530
bunch of rock bands I got I'm going to

82
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,060
be a drummer like placement death metal

83
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:08,770
myself and I was never no intention of

84
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,209
going to college and in some of the Air

85
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:12,970
Force and the army but actually through

86
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:16,209
that's three times and I never joined

87
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:17,560
any branches of military and you know it

88
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:19,418
was kind of doing this and I'm better at

89
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,738
their friend of mine and he really got

90
00:04:19,418 --> 00:04:22,270
me was okay like you should go to school

91
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:23,859
I was already doing a lot of programming

92
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:25,180
you know I didn't have any desire to do

93
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,650
that and he really convinced me there's

94
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,310
something I should do and I dated you

95
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:30,250
know I thank him for that

96
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:31,930
he also throughout the years you've got

97
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:34,450
me in my first professional programming

98
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:37,390
gig working not with him but you know in

99
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:39,370
a similar area that he had I've had

100
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:41,979
mentors that have helped me learn

101
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:43,810
networking like the IT networking aspect

102
00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:45,430
where you know I growing up like I

103
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:47,080
didn't have a lot of computers to play

104
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:48,550
with and so the networking and

105
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,740
operations kind of standpoint that a lot

106
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,360
of people take for granted a I never

107
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:55,390
really learned you know I still kind of

108
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:57,520
laughed a bit of laps here but I've been

109
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:59,229
able to work with these mentors and help

110
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,930
you know teach me that stuff which has

111
00:04:59,229 --> 00:05:03,669
been great also getting into security

112
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:05,979
itself I've been going to cons for a

113
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:08,020
long time and I actually turned down job

114
00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:09,490
offers for years from different security

115
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:12,940
firms because none of them really fit

116
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:14,770
what I wanted to do and the people I've

117
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:18,550
met and network with you know like the

118
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:20,669
just got here Dave so did you know we

119
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:22,600
really kind of like got me into it and

120
00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:24,430
you know that's how I got

121
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,870
security people you know you get

122
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:27,730
insecurity break into it well networking

123
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:30,370
is a great thing but also understanding

124
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:31,630
that meeting people is great and getting

125
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:34,120
yourself out there networking but also

126
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:36,010
like trying to figure out like where are

127
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:39,220
you even looking to go and that can be a

128
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:40,360
big question and you know don't wait to

129
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,950
really figure that out it's like meeting

130
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,780
people doing the same job or getting out

131
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:47,500
there and finding somebody that can help

132
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:49,659
guide that career path and then you know

133
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,580
also like just being able to push you

134
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:53,290
know myself like help having somebody

135
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,669
guide and like I write like you're kind

136
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:56,050
of flatlining you need to push yourself

137
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:58,080
a little more just like a you know gym

138
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:00,760
assistant or you know personal trainer

139
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,669
so in over the years these people become

140
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:06,940
like some of the best friends and I'm

141
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:09,790
sorry about the slides um but so one way

142
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:12,160
I decided to mentor is that uh you know

143
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:13,510
I've done it throughout my jobs you know

144
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,770
whether it's teaching silly some

145
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:16,390
programming language or helping guide

146
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:17,830
them through developing some application

147
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:21,610
or getting them up to speed on some

148
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:23,200
security stuff but I met Keith and you

149
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:24,790
know we had a brief meeting then here's

150
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,590
hey I'm looking for somebody to teach me

151
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:28,240
some application security stuff and I'm

152
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:29,919
like hey I can do that and it kind of

153
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,380
just be started doing it and we've been

154
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:34,150
reading weekly if not more than that

155
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:36,400
sometimes for nine months now almost and

156
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:37,750
cover yourself in basic a lot of things

157
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,599
all the way through some more you know

158
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:44,620
projects and working through stuff but I

159
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:46,960
think there isn't a lot of value in this

160
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:48,700
methodology of apprenticeship and you

161
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,840
see it a lot of other career paths you

162
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,760
know doctors have their residency

163
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,950
program there's professional engineers

164
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,480
and novice engineers in order to get

165
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:57,310
your PE certification you have to work

166
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,200
under a novice of a professional

167
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:00,550
engineer for four years and before you

168
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,070
can take the test to get signed off on

169
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:04,600
and that's a lot of like on-the-job

170
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:06,010
training and kind of distilling that

171
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,140
knowledge and experience from the

172
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:10,330
professional engineer into the one you

173
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:11,740
know coming up in that field and there's

174
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:13,719
a lot of second now even with all of our

175
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:15,850
information security programs there's a

176
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,590
big aspect of it that's just not hot

177
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:19,210
right unless you're picking it up on the

178
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:21,280
side and you know you're interested in

179
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:22,150
it you're going to go do that there's

180
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,859
just a lot that you're not going to

181
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:26,080
learn in school whatever so saying you

182
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,850
know for years sans degree or you know

183
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,789
college any world that has an

184
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:34,560
information security program and you

185
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:34,560
know your Jedi and Padawan relationship

186
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,599
so what is mentoring um you know this is

187
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,640
one Wikipedia had a pretty good idea

188
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,620
that kind of aligns with like what I

189
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,580
kind of viewed mentorship has and its

190
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,560
relationship to what's a more

191
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,580
experienced a knowledgeable person helps

192
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,900
to guide the less experienced

193
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:50,270
knowledgeable person that's essentially

194
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:52,010
it but this also doesn't have to be you

195
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:53,479
know technology-based right my

196
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:55,909
mentorship the case is very technology

197
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:57,740
focused but also I've you know helped

198
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:59,180
other people like guides our career like

199
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:01,100
where you want to go like you don't want

200
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:02,690
to do this so you know help kind of did

201
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,610
that or even salary advice or like how

202
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:06,110
do you get to a technical interview or

203
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:08,180
something like that

204
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:10,040
I also do mentoring as a leadership in

205
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,830
action so the best managers I've ever

206
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:14,300
worked for have been ones that you know

207
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:17,180
I'm not just a person there to do a job

208
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:19,310
you know that to be managed but somebody

209
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:21,080
that they want to help grow and be

210
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:23,660
successful and provide the resources of

211
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,099
tools for that to happen and you know if

212
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:27,770
you allow something to do that and allow

213
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:29,720
them that air to breathe you know you'll

214
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:32,329
see you you know you can get some pretty

215
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,979
successful people out of that and you

216
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:35,030
know it part of that is if you're

217
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:36,920
managing somebody or you're working

218
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:39,079
somebody you want them to you know go

219
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:41,449
beyond you you want them to grow and to

220
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,040
move on or you know take over some like

221
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,420
that and you know when you're it's like

222
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,250
raising kids I know how many people kids

223
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,900
here but you know why because mom and I

224
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,400
ever since the scene was born

225
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,329
we've always been under the you know the

226
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,459
thing that we're not raising a child

227
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,720
we're raising a future adult and so

228
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:57,530
we've always treated him like that and

229
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:59,780
we want him to be successful and grow I

230
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:01,100
also view the relationship between the

231
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,810
mentor and mentee or what everyone call

232
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:05,210
it it was a professional relationship

233
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:06,709
and Keith and I you know even you know I

234
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:08,150
mean we haven't quite gone that far but

235
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:09,500
you know it's like we have like this you

236
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,760
know every week and we're going to do

237
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,790
this meeting or it would be professional

238
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:15,170
about it but you know I also a lot of

239
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,880
people like I'm friends with that ask

240
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,959
questions of and you know like that's

241
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,550
great like that's thing but you know

242
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,170
ours is kind of a more formalized thing

243
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:24,099
and we'll talk to you more about that in

244
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:24,099
a few slides here

245
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:33,790
and keeps our great quote the other day

246
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:37,839
of mentorship is like two swords at

247
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:40,420
sharpen one another and you know because

248
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,980
it is like we've helped me like learn a

249
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:44,110
tremendous amount and I felt him learn a

250
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:45,220
lot and we're still doing it and it's

251
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:47,050
one of those it's a great relationship

252
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,910
from that perspective where you know

253
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:56,410
even if you're an expert at it you're

254
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:59,079
still going to learn stuff so one thing

255
00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:00,399
is to is like you know like if you're

256
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:01,359
interested in mentoring somebody it's

257
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,649
like you know what understand your

258
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,889
motivations for doing so like why do you

259
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:07,329
want to do it you know um do you you

260
00:10:05,889 --> 00:10:08,889
know figure out like why air is you're

261
00:10:07,329 --> 00:10:10,540
knowledgeable in right it doesn't have

262
00:10:08,889 --> 00:10:11,949
to be like oh just I want to mentor you

263
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:14,889
and like security or something you know

264
00:10:11,949 --> 00:10:17,019
you can spics picked a specific area and

265
00:10:14,889 --> 00:10:18,579
also look at you all the time like don't

266
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:21,069
overcome yourself because it's not fair

267
00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:23,170
to you or anyone else or the person

268
00:10:21,069 --> 00:10:24,490
you're mentoring to Tom but it does have

269
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:29,259
to be long either you know I mean Keith

270
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:30,759
and I like me an hour a week but so you

271
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:31,600
know to be a good mentor like one of

272
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:33,279
these like you know know your

273
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,810
motivations know your limits patience

274
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,130
communication and be vulnerable you know

275
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:38,170
we critique each other all the time

276
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:39,459
you know keith has helped me go over all

277
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:41,469
like the workshop we did yesterday all

278
00:10:39,459 --> 00:10:43,599
the slides and like this is not you know

279
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:45,040
add more here you know and you need to

280
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,500
be able to eat those criticisms fine and

281
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,910
it opened off of all things but you know

282
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,620
patience you know if you're you're just

283
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,819
like anything else you're teaching you

284
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:54,040
know it can be really frustrating

285
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:56,229
sometimes I talk college for a semester

286
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:58,120
I've done a lot of workshops and

287
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:59,829
presentations and it can be very

288
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,350
difficult to teach somebody so you got

289
00:10:59,829 --> 00:11:03,670
to like kind of patience back off but

290
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:05,949
know your limits too it's like you know

291
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:07,719
if your overburden or you like don't

292
00:11:05,949 --> 00:11:08,620
time don't do it if you're getting the

293
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:12,910
stuff that you don't know a lot about

294
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:16,089
just say so you know so you know funny

295
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:17,469
Amenti yeah they also call like when the

296
00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:19,540
teachers ready except like you know that

297
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:21,850
type of thing but also you know getting

298
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:23,050
out there networking there's a lot of

299
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:24,550
people around here I know a lot of

300
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,810
companies are hiring there's a lot of

301
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:27,550
people looking to get in the industry

302
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,349
and you know this is something where

303
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:31,029
Austin veterans you know where people

304
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:32,620
have been in like can help get these

305
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:34,509
people started like we do need more

306
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:36,160
people in our industry we also need to

307
00:11:34,509 --> 00:11:38,740
find the right places for them to go and

308
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,029
that's something that you know walk

309
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,059
around and you know talking people on

310
00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:41,989
tables is not really

311
00:11:41,059 --> 00:11:44,959
help you because everyone's trying to

312
00:11:41,989 --> 00:11:47,689
hire you or something Keith also has

313
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:49,549
InfoSec mentors net project it's you

314

315
00:11:49,549 --> 00:11:53,389
to be mentored in these subject areas or

316
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:55,129
I'm looking to teach in these subject

317
00:11:53,389 --> 00:11:56,839
areas and then it will match you with

318
00:11:55,129 --> 00:11:58,879
people that the same things and emails

319
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:04,459
like a matchmaking thing it's pretty

320
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:07,339
cool we'll talk about that so so

321
00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:09,589
practical like we do all of our meetings

322
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:11,509
of our hangouts and we summer for quite

323
00:12:09,589 --> 00:12:12,859
a bit because there's something I want

324
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:15,859
to try out from SpiderOak and it's just

325
00:12:12,859 --> 00:12:18,499
like a kind of a slack kind of private

326
00:12:15,859 --> 00:12:20,269
flack channel type thing but so you

327
00:12:18,499 --> 00:12:22,969
won't be set for success you know

328
00:12:20,269 --> 00:12:25,249
meetings we try to have measurable goals

329
00:12:22,969 --> 00:12:27,799
so we say okay like what is it we want

330
00:12:25,249 --> 00:12:29,389
to accomplish here and we make sure that

331
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:33,079
we time box of meetings okay it's an

332
00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:34,639
hour like see you next week let's go we

333
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:36,138
try to have an agenda every meeting and

334
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,429
that might be just something we're going

335
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:38,779
to discuss that one meeting it might be

336
00:12:37,429 --> 00:12:41,419
something we're discussing over the

337
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:43,249
course of a month or two and you know

338
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:45,109
try I refill at this but try take

339
00:12:43,249 --> 00:12:47,449
meeting notes it's helpful to refer back

340
00:12:45,109 --> 00:12:49,219
to like it comes up like don't derail

341
00:12:47,449 --> 00:12:49,929
everything put in the notes come back to

342
00:12:49,219 --> 00:12:52,399
it later

343
00:12:49,929 --> 00:12:53,929
wait every time two week schedule annex

344
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,069
meeting are is a fairly recurring but

345
00:12:53,929 --> 00:12:58,488
we've also had to adjust things like

346
00:12:55,069 --> 00:13:00,529
patents and their you know we we use

347
00:12:58,489 --> 00:13:01,789
hangouts and summer for like I said

348
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:05,179
mostly but I mean there's a lot of ways

349
00:13:01,789 --> 00:13:08,629
to conduct these things so the first

350
00:13:05,179 --> 00:13:09,889
meeting one of the things are key

351
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:11,929
tonight sat down for when we first

352
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:13,489
started was we just the first movie to

353
00:13:11,929 --> 00:13:15,079
still can discuss you know what was

354
00:13:13,489 --> 00:13:17,509
going on and it kind of get to know each

355
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:19,069
other little bit better and figure out

356
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:20,929
like what he wants to get out of it and

357
00:13:19,069 --> 00:13:22,659
what I wanted to get out of it and we

358
00:13:20,929 --> 00:13:24,379
kind of like use that as you know our

359
00:13:22,659 --> 00:13:26,718
takeaways and like what we're going to

360
00:13:24,379 --> 00:13:28,009
do we've done some more for more like

361
00:13:26,719 --> 00:13:29,479
lesson plan type stuff where I build

362
00:13:28,009 --> 00:13:31,149
like some applications and we do some

363
00:13:29,479 --> 00:13:33,739
walkthroughs and some different exploits

364
00:13:31,149 --> 00:13:36,259
you know introduce some tools that type

365
00:13:33,739 --> 00:13:37,669
of thing but we also discuss like art

366
00:13:36,259 --> 00:13:39,169
what is our schedule going to look like

367
00:13:37,669 --> 00:13:40,579
you know it can we do a recurring one

368
00:13:39,169 --> 00:13:42,589
and use kind of got all those details

369
00:13:40,579 --> 00:13:44,179
out of the way and then you know the

370
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:45,559
desired outcomes you know what is it

371
00:13:44,179 --> 00:13:47,478
that we're trying to hear so this could

372
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:49,789
be an example where you have somebody is

373
00:13:47,479 --> 00:13:51,320
trying to take like the osep exam and

374
00:13:49,789 --> 00:13:53,180
pass that

375
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,440
it's like if you have done that you know

376
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:56,270
somebody out like art so our goal is to

377
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:59,090
get you knowledgeable enough to past

378
00:13:56,270 --> 00:14:01,010
osep and maybe you focus on that for a

379
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:03,290
period of time and then that's it that's

380
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:04,670
the end of your you know little vent or

381
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:06,140
relationship or something like that but

382
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:07,819
you know it's just understanding like

383
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:09,199
where you're going you know so that

384
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:11,000
every meeting is not just like a rant

385
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:13,300
that you're actually getting something

386
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,070
out of it

387
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:17,630
subsequent meetings um you know like I

388
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,860
said take a review notes because we can

389
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:20,060
go back and you can review them like we

390
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,800
were talk about this like did you want

391
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:23,930
to revisit that or move on something

392
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:26,479
else we do all that previous work

393
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:28,670
discuss the next steps look at your

394
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,410
progress goals like if you do have a

395
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:32,240
goal in mind like passing the exam or

396
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:33,319
the CSS P maybe for somebody getting in

397
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,970
industry or something else

398
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,680
where are you progressing on that level

399
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:37,490
and you know what do we need to do to

400
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,739
make sure that you're going to be

401
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:40,850
successful in that the other thing is

402
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,170
that you know Keaton I trying to be very

403
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:43,970
respectful to each other's times I think

404
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:46,490
everyone should be I'm a big proponent

405
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:48,380
of that and we try and keep things time

406
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:49,910
boxed and not you know drag things out

407
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:51,439
or you know bother each other like all

408
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:55,939
hours a night like I was doing with him

409
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:57,620
like last week um but uh yeah so we have

410
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:59,630
you know fairly communication travel but

411
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:01,730
your respect your other people's time

412
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:03,230
and don't over extend the order

413
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:05,030
you know both on both parties right

414
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:06,230
don't try and take too much of the other

415
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,790
person's time you don't expect like

416
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:09,320
somebody else to spend like you know all

417
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:13,130
week on something and also something

418
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:14,480
that they're really interested in so

419
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:17,090
when it's time to end you know things

420
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,580
change you know it could and hopefully

421
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:21,890
it ends well your friends and move on

422
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:24,080
you know I definitely have had you know

423
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:25,670
a lot of that but it doesn't always in

424
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,350
that way but you know maybe you

425
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:29,719
reevaluate like okay like this has been

426
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:31,490
great for you know this period of time

427
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,840
but now he needs to back like you know

428
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:35,240
we're getting too busy things change not

429
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:36,830
a big deal but you know don't look at it

430
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,840
as like oh I'm going to get you know

431
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:40,160
irritated with that if my mentee like

432
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,260
disappears or something like that you

433
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,730
know it is what it is but also like I

434
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:45,740
told I really try not to burn bridges

435
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:48,260
because this is a small world especially

436
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:49,490
in InfoSec and like you know you want to

437
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:52,420
leave a good impression and that's on

438
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:54,830
both parties - right

439
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:56,900
and I would hope that I wouldn't need to

440
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:58,370
say that but you you know I don't know

441
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,930
there's there's a lot of people out

442
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:01,170
there you know feelings get hurt

443
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:04,229
sometimes

444
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:06,628
so collateral dem damage or developments

445
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:09,449
from the stuff that we working on from

446
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:10,859
both of us and so the kid you know Keith

447
00:16:09,449 --> 00:16:16,799
wants to come up here and we can talk

448
00:16:10,859 --> 00:16:18,329
about similar stuff what student so this

449
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:19,919
is a little loud sorry so one of the

450
00:16:18,329 --> 00:16:21,899
things I did before this meeting as I

451
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:23,970
told Casey it was panicking a little bit

452
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:25,649
building his being in class and then

453
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:27,569
preparing the slides like I said well

454
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:29,459
we're both going to be at this thing if

455
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:32,579
you need someone to pitch in to help you

456
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:34,529
feel some time I'm happy to maybe do a

457
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:35,729
bit of a Q&A and talk a little bit about

458
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:38,009
some of the projects that we worked on

459
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:39,600
so Casey would you rather start with

460
00:16:38,009 --> 00:16:40,799
talking about maybe projects or maybe

461
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,939
ask the questions first and come back

462
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:44,669
and kind of wrap up thoughts on the

463
00:16:41,939 --> 00:16:46,099
projects because I think that's a place

464
00:16:44,669 --> 00:16:48,929
do that

465
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:51,660
I'm so glad come on stop messing with us

466
00:16:48,929 --> 00:16:58,679
so one of the things that I just wanted

467
00:16:51,660 --> 00:17:00,660
to mention is part of the reason me one

468
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:02,429
of the reasons that we even started this

469
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,529
mentorship is last year I started

470
00:17:02,429 --> 00:17:05,908
working on the implementers project or

471
00:17:04,529 --> 00:17:08,039
the relaunch of the InfoSec mentors

472
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:09,329
project and for me it was a situation

473
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:10,679
where I knew that there are a lot of

474
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:12,029
people starting out in the industry that

475
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:13,139
needed mentorship there were people that

476
00:17:12,029 --> 00:17:14,819
were interested in providing mentorship

477
00:17:13,138 --> 00:17:16,469
and I wanted to look for way to bring

478
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:18,418
those people together I was learning

479
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:20,579
flasks I was learning web application

480
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:22,949
security it was a big driver behind that

481
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:24,809
and so I reached out on Twitter because

482
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:26,189
I needed help I mean admittedly I

483
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:30,299
couldn't build this thing all by myself

484
00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:33,179
so reached out in case you said yeah you

485
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:34,529
need a mentor or a short why not and as

486
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:36,299
you'll see as part of the code commits

487
00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:37,860
on in post like Mentors Casey did a

488
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:41,190
really good job helping to set up like a

489
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:42,658
testbed environment for vagrant gave me

490
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:44,610
a lot of feedback and regular basis as

491
00:17:42,659 --> 00:17:47,850
to how do I get that up and running and

492
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:49,590
as a result of that as of just a few

493
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:52,080
days ago we have over 300 people

494
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:54,240
registered on the site we have something

495
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,490
like a 33 percent mentor to mentee

496
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,480
matched ratio so it's when you sign up

497
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:59,220
three skills that you could potentially

498
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,230
teach someone three skills that you'd

499
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,760
like to learn then you're basically

500
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:04,409
signed up had suggests it'll match you

501
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,760
with someone that meets the skills that

502
00:18:04,409 --> 00:18:07,529
you want to learn and then you can

503
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,820
connect with them and if they agree to

504
00:18:07,529 --> 00:18:10,019
connect then you've got a mentorship

505
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,700
setup right there

506
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:12,820
so it's really great expectations in

507
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:15,190
case you did a really good job

508
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:17,320
helping me get that launched so that was

509
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:19,600
a collaborative effort that came out as

510
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:22,360
a result of my mentorship or Casey's

511
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,799
mentorship of me I'm sure that I

512
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,149
probably bothered you way too much with

513
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:26,649
that but feel free to jump in and add

514
00:18:25,149 --> 00:18:28,570
some thoughts no I mean it was pretty

515
00:18:26,649 --> 00:18:30,580
cool like actually he extended the

516
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:32,049
project that was picked up from some

517
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:34,570
other people in the industry that kind

518
00:18:32,049 --> 00:18:36,519
of languished and he rejected that and I

519
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:38,529
didn't even really touch any code on it

520
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:39,850
I don't think I did at all today no it's

521
00:18:38,529 --> 00:18:41,169
fully developed by him in every funk

522
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:42,850
that but I just kind of guided like I

523
00:18:41,169 --> 00:18:43,210
like this you know works great this is

524
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,740
cool

525
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:47,379
like you know maybe change this or that

526
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:50,470
just based on my development background

527
00:18:47,379 --> 00:18:52,750
experience but everyo definitely

528
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:54,789
recommend checking out the others that

529
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:57,580
came of this is a something that I got

530
00:18:54,789 --> 00:18:59,490
out of it was December November maybe

531
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:01,899
you know we were going through some

532
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:03,639
abstract vulnerability stuff and you

533
00:19:01,899 --> 00:19:06,580
know looking at okay like some exercise

534
00:19:03,639 --> 00:19:08,529
and sequel injection type things and he

535
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:10,299
so he brought up stack a like you know

536
00:19:08,529 --> 00:19:13,899
writings off the mean stack I'm like I

537
00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:15,220
what is the mean stack oh and it was

538
00:19:13,899 --> 00:19:16,418
something I was like the nodejs stack a

539
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,129
lot of stuff it was something that I've

540
00:19:16,419 --> 00:19:19,419
been interested in kind of learning

541
00:19:18,129 --> 00:19:21,219
about him getting into for a while and

542
00:19:19,419 --> 00:19:23,080
just haven't really made it a priority

543
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:25,179
and so he brought up because we were

544
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:27,279
discussing bug bounty programs and a lot

545
00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:28,720
of the bug bounty a lot of the

546
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:30,220
applications that you know are on these

547
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,470
bug bounty programs like heroin or

548
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:34,360
bugcrowd a lot of them are more and more

549
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:36,429
making use of either various components

550
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:38,439
of stack or the entire stack itself and

551
00:19:36,429 --> 00:19:40,509
we're like hey this is you should get

552
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,279
into this so we both bought a book

553
00:19:40,509 --> 00:19:44,860
called of you know developing and I mean

554
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:46,059
it was getting me hitting me and it was

555
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,620
funny because one day we were talking

556
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:49,269
about it I started reading the book and

557
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:51,250
I bought it on Amazon and she just said

558
00:19:49,269 --> 00:19:52,450
I was like this I'm reading this because

559
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:55,659
I felt like it was worth learning to

560
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:57,159
attack that framework and then so we're

561
00:19:55,659 --> 00:19:58,690
talking and I said weird it'd be great

562
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:01,480
Casey if we actually did something like

563
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:03,490
being mean like you know being that mean

564
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,889
person and attacking that web second so

565
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:07,840
a little bit I know actually Casey kind

566
00:20:05,889 --> 00:20:09,580
of started working on this project as an

567
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,019
idea a concept put a CFP forward got

568
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:12,939
accepted here - besides Boston I was

569
00:20:11,019 --> 00:20:16,059
like oh hey wait I know the guy that

570
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:18,429
wrote that and then we actually worked

571
00:20:16,059 --> 00:20:20,500
on it together so we really kind of

572
00:20:18,429 --> 00:20:21,850
spent like the last couple months

573
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:24,070
whatever like learning the meaning staff

574
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:24,549
we build some applications together and

575
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:26,950
just kind of

576
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:29,320
you know work on various parts of it and

577
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:31,029
apply my vulnerability knowledge and

578
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,289
social knowledge into what we were doing

579
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:34,149
like our like how I was just exploited

580
00:20:32,289 --> 00:20:35,739
you know I've done some angularjs

581
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:37,029
exploitation in the past but as a guard

582
00:20:35,739 --> 00:20:39,219
we have this other stack and nodejs

583
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:41,200
thing and so do this to kind of start to

584
00:20:39,219 --> 00:20:42,669
come together and there's like you know

585
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,049
we both ran this workshop yes traitors

586
00:20:42,669 --> 00:20:45,369
pretty good we had like what 40 people

587
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:47,168
here at 30 talks something like that

588
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:51,129
yeah and it was awesome about it too is

589
00:20:47,169 --> 00:20:52,989
as part of this my interest in in kind

590
00:20:51,129 --> 00:20:55,478
of the student side of really learning

591
00:20:52,989 --> 00:20:56,979
something has driven Casey's development

592
00:20:55,479 --> 00:20:58,779
of knowledge from attacking that web

593
00:20:56,979 --> 00:21:00,190
stack and so in a way it's like he goes

594
00:20:58,779 --> 00:21:02,049
out and he's learning it and that I'm

595
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:04,239
also learning the e attack portions from

596
00:21:02,049 --> 00:21:06,849
Casey all learning the building portions

597
00:21:04,239 --> 00:21:09,849
on my side as well and as a result of

598
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:11,019
that I think that yesterday I saw one of

599
00:21:09,849 --> 00:21:13,329
the students came up with the idea of

600
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:15,399
how to do some of the more automated

601
00:21:13,329 --> 00:21:16,839
cross-site scripting exactly like I know

602
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:18,488
how that would work from the templating

603
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:21,158
engine side because I learned a lot of

604
00:21:18,489 --> 00:21:22,719
that and it that's been an awesome

605
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:24,219
effort in terms of building that out I

606
00:21:22,719 --> 00:21:25,869
think that we're looking at building an

607
00:21:24,219 --> 00:21:27,429
each-way actually a longer class I've

608
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:29,079
convinced Casey are I think I've

609
00:21:27,429 --> 00:21:31,119
convinced Casey to turn it into a plural

610
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:32,859
site course just because it's a stack

611
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:35,049
that you don't see a lot of security

612
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:36,549
knowledge in yeah it might I might do

613
00:21:35,049 --> 00:21:38,109
the thing that show that gonna do like a

614
00:21:36,549 --> 00:21:39,309
free like webinar WebEx or whatever

615
00:21:38,109 --> 00:21:41,079
excited a lot of people are hitting me

616
00:21:39,309 --> 00:21:42,549
up about it and like I mean it's like

617
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:44,349
the information is out there for the

618
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:46,690
most part there's a lot more research to

619
00:21:44,349 --> 00:21:48,279
do like that you know there's some stuff

620
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:53,019
like especially on the MongoDB injection

621
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:54,039
type the no sequel injection like not a

622
00:21:53,019 --> 00:21:55,899
lot of information on actual

623
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:57,399
exploitation is out there and some of

624
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:59,109
those can be really difficult or weird

625
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:01,268
to exploit but something we're probably

626
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:02,529
working on to you know we all said this

627
00:22:01,269 --> 00:22:04,389
idea for this talk to you like well

628
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:06,729
might as well like you know just talk on

629
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:08,769
it we've also got this other project

630
00:22:06,729 --> 00:22:10,929
coming up called his kind of brainchild

631
00:22:08,769 --> 00:22:12,489
I'm gonna help him with tactic and IO so

632
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:14,049
if you want to talk about that yeah yeah

633
00:22:12,489 --> 00:22:15,309
so one of the things that came about as

634
00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:17,769
a result of actually building the being

635
00:22:15,309 --> 00:22:18,999
mean workshop is is I realized as I'm

636
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:21,549
learning a lot of different languages

637
00:22:18,999 --> 00:22:23,079
that I'm not practicing my web

638
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:25,599
application security skills while I'm

639
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:27,158
learning to develop Java and so as you

640
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:28,809
start to kind of focus in one area the

641
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:30,399
other area gets rusty and then if I go

642
00:22:28,809 --> 00:22:33,039
back and forth it was a problem of I'm

643
00:22:30,399 --> 00:22:34,449
getting rust the other way so why not

644
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,879
just kind of integrate it all into one

645
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:38,029
workflow learn how to build vulnerable

646
00:22:36,879 --> 00:22:39,408
applications learn how to

647
00:22:38,029 --> 00:22:40,669
use the toolsets techniques and

648
00:22:39,409 --> 00:22:42,649
practices to actually attack the

649
00:22:40,669 --> 00:22:43,909
vulnerable application then go back and

650
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:45,678
kind of take those developer half

651
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:47,509
measures of fixing things so you

652
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,340
eventually learn what bad code looks

653
00:22:47,509 --> 00:22:50,869
like how to attack it and test it and

654
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:53,330
eventually what good code should look

655
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:54,799
like at the end of that result and KC

656
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,939
being a little bit more knowledgeable on

657
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,158
the attack side is helping me out in

658
00:22:55,940 --> 00:23:00,200
kind of focusing and I'm building the

659
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,149
attacks and I'm focusing on how to learn

660
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,489
to develop at the same time so it's like

661
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:05,658
a collaborative effort of quickly

662
00:23:04,489 --> 00:23:08,090
cycling through the learning process

663
00:23:05,659 --> 00:23:09,409
learning all of the tools that are

664
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:11,869
involved from the development through

665
00:23:09,409 --> 00:23:15,649
the attack chain and back and the other

666
00:23:11,869 --> 00:23:18,499
thing on the attacker inside the taxi

667
00:23:15,649 --> 00:23:19,998
and IO side here is like making all the

668
00:23:18,499 --> 00:23:21,710
time as an app set consulting you know

669
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:23,179
especially I do developer trainings you

670
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:25,519
always have to be able what tools or

671
00:23:23,179 --> 00:23:28,339
stuff out there and honestly I go out

672
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:29,690
not really many that um you know but

673
00:23:28,339 --> 00:23:31,070
also a lot of uses like you know doing

674
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:33,289
static analysis and JavaScript is

675
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:35,210
extremely difficult you know there's

676
00:23:33,289 --> 00:23:38,029
only like one or two tools that really

677
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:41,419
supported even or anywhere near like a

678
00:23:38,029 --> 00:23:42,589
decent job at all and it's kind of

679
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:44,239
developing a resource so I cook they're

680
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:46,249
like we're developing a stack like what

681
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:48,379
tools are out there like that are usable

682
00:23:46,249 --> 00:23:49,729
and come like a DevOps standpoint or

683
00:23:48,379 --> 00:23:51,439
really kind of fit that development

684
00:23:49,729 --> 00:23:53,179
pattern so like you know if it's like a

685
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,580
IDE plug-in or something like that like

686
00:23:53,179 --> 00:23:57,289
your evaluate like how good is this how

687
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:58,489
does it work right and actually building

688
00:23:57,289 --> 00:24:00,710
a kind of resource out there where you

689
00:23:58,489 --> 00:24:02,269
can kind of direct people to and we have

690
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:04,460
a lot more you know stuff that we've

691
00:24:02,269 --> 00:24:06,409
been tossing on to and you know I'm not

692
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:07,969
I don't think we're we're essentially

693
00:24:06,409 --> 00:24:08,929
trying to say like look but you know

694
00:24:07,969 --> 00:24:10,099
we're just trying to say like this it'll

695
00:24:08,929 --> 00:24:12,080
stuff we've done that's been a direct

696
00:24:10,099 --> 00:24:14,539
result of you know even kind of talking

697
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,249
being a relationship like this and I you

698
00:24:14,539 --> 00:24:19,879
know there's a lot of stuff out there it

699
00:24:16,249 --> 00:24:20,839
can be done and you know if you possibly

700
00:24:19,879 --> 00:24:22,099
us interested like maybe we could get

701
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:24,408
together combine your forces and like

702
00:24:22,099 --> 00:24:25,820
you know go off and do projects it's

703
00:24:24,409 --> 00:24:28,999
been very like successful from that

704
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:31,279
standpoint I've actually got a series of

705
00:24:28,999 --> 00:24:33,619
questions that I set up as well so what

706
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:35,179
entities are either so I ever actually

707
00:24:33,619 --> 00:24:36,139
shared these questions with Casey and I

708
00:24:35,179 --> 00:24:37,429
thought it would be a good opportunity

709
00:24:36,139 --> 00:24:39,199
being that we're both here at this

710
00:24:37,429 --> 00:24:41,509
conference - you get a little bit of

711
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,129
like the mentorship view and kind of

712
00:24:41,509 --> 00:24:44,570
make this also a dialogue so for those

713
00:24:43,129 --> 00:24:46,219
of you that are like seeking mentorship

714
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:48,229
maybe having Casey ask some questions of

715
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:49,729
me as to you know from the mentee

716
00:24:48,229 --> 00:24:51,260
perspective like what should you do to

717
00:24:49,729 --> 00:24:52,340
prepare yourself to be

718
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:54,170
collaborative part of this is you can

719
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:55,580
see like a lot of the work that's come

720
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:57,350
out of this mentorship has been very

721
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:58,909
fruitful for both of us I mean KCC are

722
00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:01,399
talking today he was training yesterday

723
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:02,810
and we both learned a great deal as a

724
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:05,000
result of this mentorship it's not just

725
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:06,860
a one-way street so the first question I

726
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,700
had and I think this is important for

727
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:10,070
those people that are newer to the

728
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:11,630
industry is if a person is very new to

729
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:13,159
the industry do you think it's

730
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:15,560
appropriate for them to get a mentor

731
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:17,270
right away or should that person try to

732
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:20,570
learn the skills themselves before they

733
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:23,600
actually seek out a mentorship I think

734
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:26,659
that to be really successful at that and

735
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,520
the person should kind of see where they

736
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:31,910
enjoy spending their time and if things

737
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:35,720
you know like try things and figure that

738
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:36,680
out because otherwise like you my take

739
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,300
is like you'd want to find like

740
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:40,520
specifically like we focus more on AB

741
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,690
SEC you know if you were like hey I want

742
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,730
you somewhere network security like I

743
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:45,620
mean I got really that's not my gig you

744
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:47,870
know I mean we could play like learn it

745
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:49,399
but I mean I think that it should be

746
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:51,949
something that you go out and seek out

747
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:54,620
and that's kind of creepy too like we'd

748
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:56,210
be my mentor somebody I think I think it

749
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:58,010
naturally will come about and I think

750
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:59,360
that just getting in and kind of taking

751
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:02,240
and going to conferences like you know

752
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,830
your loss meetups or chapter meetings or

753
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,760
the opss ball centers from the regional

754
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:07,340
ones where you can meet people in your

755
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:10,280
area I think it's a great way of doing

756
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:12,139
that and so I think that you know when

757
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,310
it'll happen naturally but I don't think

758
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:15,170
that you should be out there like

759
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:16,250
looking for like find somebody mentor I

760
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:17,360
think you might even want apply to

761
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:20,780
people you talk to you about career

762
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,979
choices but you know that's sir yeah so

763
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:24,560
more or less than just kind of a

764
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:25,280
summarize that your idea is a person

765
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,050
should know what they want to learn

766
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:29,389
before they engage a mentor is that fair

767
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:31,340
yeah I think so so another question is a

768
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:32,540
follow-up to that is also for that those

769
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,250
people that want to figure out what they

770
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:35,840
want to learn are there any resources

771
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:38,420
that you recommend to those that are

772
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:43,730
newer to the industry to explore or kind

773
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:44,780
of feel out those areas I mean

774
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:46,700
everyone's you know essentially want to

775
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:48,710
start with a loss but my suggestions

776
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:50,720
like don't stop there I mean else is

777
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:52,070
kind of a great like starting point but

778
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,780
I mean there's a lot of stuff it doesn't

779
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:56,419
cover there's a lot of other things that

780
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:57,980
you should also be looking and just just

781
00:26:56,420 --> 00:27:00,140
doing your own research digging in and

782
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:01,550
just take something and focus on it for

783
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:03,620
a while and like just dig in and see

784
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:04,710
what you can learn about it awesome I

785
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:06,989
mean as well

786
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:09,899
my side when I was figuring out kind of

787
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:11,340
what I like to learn i used cyber ruit

788
00:27:09,899 --> 00:27:12,870
to go through a lot of the free

789
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:14,100
education courses just I've never

790
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:16,320
refused any of those so I don't know

791
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:17,789
yeah yeah for me it was like I didn't

792
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,260
know where to start so that's kind of

793
00:27:17,789 --> 00:27:21,870
where I started to figure that out and

794
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:23,700
then I met Casey and I definitely want

795
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:25,379
to do ab sex so it's it perfectly yeah

796
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,669
and a lot of the regional conferences

797
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:28,320
like BSS Boston or if you're somewhere

798
00:27:26,669 --> 00:27:29,340
else they always do like workshops or

799
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,830
something you're usually pretty cheap

800
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:33,449
like I think mine is like 35 bucks but I

801
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:35,399
think well yeah right right they're like

802
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:36,659
the first yeah I mean it's like you know

803
00:27:35,399 --> 00:27:37,979
so I'd like to think that there's a lot

804
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:39,480
of good information there and people

805
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,529
learn a lot but I also get an

806
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,510
opportunity like you know for

807
00:27:40,529 --> 00:27:43,919
essentially you know almost no costs are

808
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:46,140
free to just try something out and see

809
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,240
if you're into it or like it or not so

810
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:50,190
my next question is as a mentor how

811
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,890
important is it that your apprentice

812
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:55,559
comes prepared for meetings pretty

813
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:57,720
important I mean it's you know you're

814
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:59,279
taking somebody's time and I I try and

815
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,409
be as prepared as I can be be on time

816
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,610
because like I'm one those people I will

817
00:28:01,409 --> 00:28:04,320
show up ten minutes early to a meeting

818
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:05,490
and I don't like being kept waiting

819
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,439
especially if it's somebody else's

820
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:09,750
meeting and to me that's just a sign of

821
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,490
respect and I think that like having

822
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:13,140
knowledge that's why I think you know

823
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:14,220
hey we're ending a meeting what are we

824
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,779
going to discuss next week or what we

825
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:18,330
want to work on because if we want to

826
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:19,200
like go over like okay can you work

827
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:21,689
through some blogging sequel injection

828
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,740
with me like as if I'm mentoring him and

829
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:24,450
dad I need make sure I have something

830
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,770
ready to go because it's kind of hard to

831
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:27,600
teach if you're just talking about it

832
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:28,799
you actually do it and so I need to you

833
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,689
know do my part to make sure I'd have of

834
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:32,940
app or something that we can demo and

835
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:34,049
use together and then also you know it's

836
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:35,370
very hard to teach blind sequel

837
00:28:34,049 --> 00:28:37,440
injection if somebody just shows up and

838
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:38,760
Aaron what sequel injection is so it's

839
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,440
like being prepared and like understand

840
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,490
like what's going on and we've been I

841
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,440
think I think we've done a pretty good

842
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:45,270
job of that I don't think there's really

843
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,860
been any times unless were a few times

844
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:49,200
we were both busy and traveling around

845
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:51,120
but so I think it's gone pretty well

846
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,380
from that perspective and I know as well

847
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,760
- there have been times where it's been

848
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:56,250
kind of like a last minute but we've had

849
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:59,070
to cancel out you know on each other for

850
00:28:56,250 --> 00:29:00,270
different reasons and I think that being

851
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:02,309
respectful of each other's time by

852
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:03,809
making sure they don't show up and then

853
00:29:02,309 --> 00:29:05,700
you never show up without letting them

854
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:08,190
know what's going on that's never

855
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,240
happened to us which is good I mean it's

856
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,620
not that I can remember I think there

857
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,700
was maybe one time or it was like hey

858
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,989
Casey you're coming on you're like oh

859
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,940
crap yeah I'll be there in a few minutes

860
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:17,320
but that's happened to me at the same

861
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:19,840
time cos so

862
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:21,460
that curiosity this is more for maybe of

863
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:25,149
my own knowledge can you tell when your

864
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:26,769
apprentice hasn't prepared it yeah

865
00:29:25,149 --> 00:29:28,629
depends what we're working on you know I

866
00:29:26,769 --> 00:29:30,190
mean like so a big chunk of our times

867
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:31,299
just being this workshop you know and I

868
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:33,460
think that you know we've been working

869
00:29:31,299 --> 00:29:34,960
on that although I know about you I mean

870
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:36,279
working on that workshop and various

871
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,980
stuff coming out of workshop like

872
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:41,110
ongoing for months now we kind of

873
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:42,429
redesigned er I heard some reason like I

874
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:43,719
was told I was only give me a five hour

875
00:29:42,429 --> 00:29:45,850
of our shop it's a guys like an entire

876
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:47,799
day also like oh crap like I need to

877
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:50,649
redo this and like took a step back and

878
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:52,450
re did what I was thinking about and so

879
00:29:50,649 --> 00:29:54,340
but maybe even like researching and you

880
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:57,490
know digging into a lot of stuff for a

881
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:58,658
while so our leaders would normally like

882
00:29:57,490 --> 00:29:59,980
just discussing what we've done like

883
00:29:58,659 --> 00:30:01,899
what we're going to be doing next on it

884
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:03,159
and you know getting his feedback on

885
00:30:01,899 --> 00:30:04,178
what I've done like do you think this is

886
00:30:03,159 --> 00:30:06,159
enough do you think this is good enough

887
00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:07,059
what what can we do different and

888
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,429
working to add to this to make it

889
00:30:07,059 --> 00:30:10,809
different so having that feedback work

890
00:30:09,429 --> 00:30:11,919
when somebody on going like that has

891
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,509
been really tremendous and helped

892
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:15,580
helping build that and you know it was

893
00:30:13,509 --> 00:30:17,259
successful because of that and I think

894
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,789
as well as part of like if you if you

895
00:30:17,259 --> 00:30:21,309
start to think about okay what can I

896
00:30:18,789 --> 00:30:23,529
offer to my mentor as feedback I think

897
00:30:21,309 --> 00:30:25,779
what's really well for us is I've been

898
00:30:23,529 --> 00:30:27,519
able to tell you even on like slide

899
00:30:25,779 --> 00:30:30,129
decks so you know this talk or the being

900
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:32,679
mean talk is as a new person this is

901
00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:35,230
what I need from this slide deck and

902
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:37,059
that's I think pretty beneficial from

903
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:38,139
like the other side it's like you you

904
00:30:37,059 --> 00:30:40,029
might not think you have something to

905
00:30:38,139 --> 00:30:41,529
offer but you do which is that

906
00:30:40,029 --> 00:30:43,330
perspective of being new to the industry

907
00:30:41,529 --> 00:30:44,710
you have an opportunity to provide that

908
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:47,590
feedback so that's a person who's

909
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:49,929
working on you know a talk or a training

910
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:53,620
can get that perspective and that's

911
00:30:49,929 --> 00:30:55,210
hopefully pretty useful yeah folios so

912
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:56,559
out of curiosity how much time do you

913
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:59,679
spend preparing for meetings with your

914
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:02,590
apprentice I've spent variously spent a

915
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:04,149
lot of time actually um so when I I've

916
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:05,740
developed so I've done a lot of

917
00:31:04,149 --> 00:31:09,250
developer training and I've taught

918
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:11,019
people very specific things and you know

919
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:12,639
why I built a lot of like kind of toy

920
00:31:11,019 --> 00:31:14,169
applications but there's like one week I

921
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:15,580
think it was a sequel injection or the

922
00:31:14,169 --> 00:31:16,809
leaders I won where I spent a lot of

923
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:19,210
time like building out like a little

924
00:31:16,809 --> 00:31:20,649
test bed you know like re strategies and

925
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:23,019
some of the ones are out there I don't

926
00:31:20,649 --> 00:31:24,489
like using off-the-shelf apps for like

927
00:31:23,019 --> 00:31:26,679
any trainings I do because I feel it's a

928
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:27,970
little like cheating you know they're

929
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:29,440
out there you can go do some whatever

930
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,240
you want to but like when I do workshops

931
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,950
were out trying

932
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,990
you could specific to the workshop and

933
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:36,090
that way also I know it in and out so I

934
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:37,800
can be very like aware of like what's

935
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:38,790
going on with it so I've actually spent

936
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:41,460
a lot of time like building up these

937
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:43,110
things like you know doing them you know

938
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:44,940
with a larger purpose to is that it's

939
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:46,320
helped me control my training so that

940
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:49,380
all this piece back and everything else

941
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:51,870
I do and so I yeah

942
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:54,600
don't waste none but somebody's in a few

943
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:55,678
hours wonderful hours admittedly I think

944
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,928
he actually finished reading the book

945
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:00,270
that I didn't get a chance to finish for

946
00:31:57,929 --> 00:32:02,040
the being mean training so I can tell

947
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:03,330
just how much Casey was putting in a lot

948
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,860
of effort and I'd learned on the fly

949
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:06,750
thankfully but I definitely picked up

950
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:08,309
things along the way which I because

951
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:10,290
like when we started working it's like I

952
00:32:08,309 --> 00:32:11,670
feel like three different mean apps like

953
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:13,500
this really small things to try out

954
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:16,050
stuff and like he was like I'm on

955
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:18,480
chapter 4 I was a little bit slower

956
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:19,830
admittedly but thankfully I worked well

957
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,330
on the fly and I think the code commits

958
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:22,500
yeah that was what a broken finger

959
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:24,360
having a flu for like three weeks

960
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,920
straight so sometimes being a mentee

961
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:27,899
part of your role is to make sure that

962
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:29,880
your mentor is doing okay check another

963
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:31,260
held supporting them any way they can I

964
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:33,030
think at one point I was like if you

965
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:35,490
need someone to type up your stuff for

966
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:37,110
this class I will do it which was pretty

967
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:40,530
awesome in the end it came out really

968
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:41,909
well so we talked a little bit about

969
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:43,800
what you do to prepare for meetings but

970
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:47,490
out of curiosity how effective have you

971
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:49,350
found it working on projects together to

972
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:52,140
me it's been one of the highlights of

973
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:54,449
this entire thing because it's something

974
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:56,520
that's come out of it the workshop and

975
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:58,140
it's been great and honestly like I

976
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:00,150
probably never have done that if I we

977
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:01,800
hadn't discussed it in like like hey you

978
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:03,210
should do this and also like you know

979
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,230
he's still pushing me to do like you

980
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:07,050
should turn this into a Pluralsight

981
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:08,700
course and you know like because I've

982
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:09,840
taken like all the Tori hunt stuff I've

983
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:11,460
gone through all of that and other

984
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,050
things my cat is like really basic and

985
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:14,910
it does not watch out there for like

986
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:17,309
some really specific abstract stuff and

987
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:19,020
so we're disgusted I can't do more

988
00:33:17,309 --> 00:33:20,879
trainings like figure it out more so if

989
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:22,470
we can do that you know somebody who is

990
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,240
an application security consultant now

991
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:25,890
to expand their skills could take but

992
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,270
also somebody's coming into application

993
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:28,860
security for like network or networking

994
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:30,870
background or something else that

995
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:32,459
they'll have resources to take to that

996
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:35,939
would be something I'd want to sit down

997
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:37,950
for you know so so like to me like I

998
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,970
love having these little goals where hey

999
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:40,470
we're going to do this and work on this

1000
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:43,400
project together and this is the outcome

1001
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:46,830
for that project and like that's been

1002
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:48,720
thank you so at a curiosity what's been

1003
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:50,850
your favorite project so far or and then

1004
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,080
second or follow-up to that is what are

1005
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:53,340
you most looking forward to from some of

1006
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,610
the work that we're going forward on I

1007
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:57,810
think that being me so um was my

1008
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:59,429
favorite so far because it's been like

1009
00:33:57,810 --> 00:34:02,250
that that's something that's really

1010
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:04,350
benefited me a lot I am more familiar

1011
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:05,820
mongodb now I know how to test for you

1012
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:08,639
know various injections I know how to

1013
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:10,440
you know someone exploit those and you

1014
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,908
know especially on the the templating

1015
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,168
engine side or server side JavaScript

1016
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:14,790
injection like I never written a reverse

1017
00:34:13,168 --> 00:34:15,960
shell in JavaScript before it's like

1018
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:17,940
there I learned how to do that and that

1019
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:20,820
was a lot of fun I didn't really look

1020
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:23,159
forward to factor them stuff there's

1021
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:25,380
there's a potential book will be writing

1022
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:27,240
as well so he's gonna be my chief active

1023
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:28,290
editor on that I think I don't know if

1024
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:30,629
that's ever gonna happen but I mean

1025
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:31,770
think right now a my my the tactic

1026
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:32,310
working on the attacker and stuff to be

1027
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:34,230
kind of fun

1028
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:36,149
and again another benefit of being a

1029
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:37,469
mentee is you can harass them about what

1030
00:34:36,149 --> 00:34:39,719
they say they're going to do and then

1031
00:34:37,469 --> 00:34:42,239
kind of hold them accountable so and at

1032
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:43,918
the same time as well like you can be as

1033
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:45,418
case you pointed out you know be

1034
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,679
vulnerable to one another so I've had

1035
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:47,668
Casey be a critic of some of my work

1036
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:49,830
which is being good because he's got

1037
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:51,449
offered really good feedback for some of

1038
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:52,590
the projects that I what was it what was

1039
00:34:51,449 --> 00:34:55,830
the quote you suggest sure that workshop

1040
00:34:52,590 --> 00:35:01,080
that was I was a UH oh you're an

1041
00:34:55,830 --> 00:35:03,450
opinionated framework yeah so out of

1042
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:05,670
curiosity as well what skills have you

1043
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:07,140
developed as a mentor as a result of

1044
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:09,420
being a mentor or what have you found

1045
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:11,460
that maybe you were surprised about in

1046
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:14,220
terms of the skills you've developed um

1047
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:16,680
I I think that I know about skills

1048
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:18,060
developed but it's been kind of in some

1049
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:20,250
ways a reaffirmation even though I do

1050
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:21,810
the stuff professionally and like I find

1051
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:24,390
stuff for clients all the time and or

1052
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:25,770
you know hopefully I do they there's

1053
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:27,810
also like a like you know what like I

1054
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:29,580
actually do have stuff to share and it's

1055
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:31,500
not just technical details it's

1056
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:33,330
knowledge and experience and that being

1057
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:35,790
reaffirmed okay like this is directly

1058
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:37,590
benefiting you I think it's awesome and

1059
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:39,060
that also helps me because like I am

1060
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:41,580
just like everyone else in this industry

1061
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:42,810
you know I don't know anyone that

1062
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:44,400
doesn't self reflect impostor syndrome

1063
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:46,470
right where you don't think you're good

1064
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,090
enough you know it's like ah what am i

1065
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:49,140
doing like I'm not gonna get to talk and

1066
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:50,550
just you know not good enough to you

1067
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:54,240
it's like yeah you are I mean look at my

1068
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:55,980
um so it's like you know getting over

1069
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,029
that is I reassurance like hey like this

1070
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,260
is valuable you know

1071
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,970
you have valuable knowledge and

1072
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:02,010
experience to share and you know I enjoy

1073
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:03,810
sharing it so and what's been really

1074
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:05,550
good as well as I've never given a talk

1075
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:06,840
before at a conference and so it's been

1076
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:08,670
nice is working with KC to put together

1077
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,930
CFPs for other talks that I proposed and

1078
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:12,120
having his critical feedback and

1079
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:13,350
thoughts on that so I think that you

1080
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,490
know it's kind of a two-way street in

1081
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:16,529
that side as well because you're you

1082
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:18,149
submitted to Derby con for the MV side

1083
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:21,300
both Vegas for attack driven development

1084
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:22,470
so hopefully fingers crossed

1085
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:26,190
I'll get a chance to do those and that

1086
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:29,310
would be pretty awesome so also I just

1087
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:31,560
curious or you know after all the time

1088
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:38,930
that we work together what motivates you

1089
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:40,140
to keep going a fear of failure okay

1090
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:42,029
okay

1091
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:44,400
I mean you know like Gary Vaynerchuk

1092
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:45,840
says I mean die tomorrow right like just

1093
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,080
keep going like got to do something and

1094
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:51,960
I you know I want to progress my own

1095
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:53,940
skills and career and this has been a

1096
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:57,290
way that I can help keep myself on that

1097
00:36:53,940 --> 00:37:00,480
path but I just you know keep going nice

1098
00:36:57,290 --> 00:37:07,920
so lastly in your eyes what separates a

1099
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:09,090
good mentorship from a great one when

1100
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:12,570
you look back on it like a year later

1101
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:14,070
and you have specific things like I

1102
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:15,630
couldn't have done this without this

1103
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:18,300
relationship or I probably wouldn't have

1104
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:19,380
you know like I mean because the whole

1105
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,610
point of this is to grow your own

1106
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:22,890
knowledge and experience and if you're

1107
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:24,150
not looking back on that and you know if

1108
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:26,910
you picked up a few things great but you

1109
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:29,490
know it's so am i I have led me to

1110
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:31,350
entire career changes right like and

1111
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:34,500
something I think that's some of the

1112
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:36,299
greatest ones and I mean we've done this

1113
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:38,700
stuff in what 8 months not even eight

1114
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:40,740
months yeah it's like four really and we

1115
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:42,540
still you know we've got next year

1116
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:43,919
almost planned out of more things that

1117
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:45,690
we're doing so it's like to me this has

1118
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,100
been a great one we've got actionable

1119
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:48,690
items we've got stuff coming out of it

1120
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,560
and it would've been great to I would

1121
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:51,900
have been enjoy to just you know

1122
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:54,000
teaching him sequel injection or

1123
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:56,010
cross-site scripting you know but like

1124
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,540
that's you could you know learn that for

1125
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:59,280
most anyone and I so I think this has

1126
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:00,270
been a great aspect from like the stuff

1127
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,610
we've been able to do and the stuff that

1128
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:04,080
we want to do so I know that for sure if

1129
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:05,310
I ever get my CFP accepted I'll be

1130
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:07,049
bugging the hell out of him to actually

1131
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:08,130
make sure my pockets is

1132
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:08,970
getting presentable but that's all the

1133
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:10,290
questions that I have her at this point

1134
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:12,660
thank you very much Casey for answering

1135
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:15,570
them and I'll let you finish your time

1136
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:17,549
yeah does anyone else have any questions

1137
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:20,180
we're promotion to wrap up so if anyone

1138
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:28,410
has any feedback questions thoughts oh

1139
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:36,330
yeah or anything yeah out of bar at a

1140
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:38,700
bar actually yeah I have no idea so

1141
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:40,319
where were we in that bar for there was

1142
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,890
a Red Hook Red Hook brewery up in

1143
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:45,240
Portsmouth

1144
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:47,240
there was a get-together that so it

1145
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:49,200
wasn't Papa Rudess it was Bill Pelletier

1146
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:50,910
and a few other people were getting

1147
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,379
together in the area and they just

1148
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:54,210
wanted to kind of meet up and grab beers

1149
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:55,470
so I decided to go cuz I knew a few

1150
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:57,390
people I saw it on Twitter I kind of

1151
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:58,230
invited myself Casey was invited a few

1152
00:38:57,390 --> 00:39:00,960
other folks that we know here were

1153
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:03,360
invited and I was at the time Matt

1154
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,490
rapid7 currently but I wasn't there at

1155
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,540
the time and so we got talking we

1156
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:08,009
discussed I was working on this

1157
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:10,440
mentorship project at the time it was

1158
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:12,030
still kind of a pie in the sky idea in

1159
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,350
Casey had mentioned that he was really

1160
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:15,900
interested in helping out him pitching

1161
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:18,089
in and it was probably about a few weeks

1162
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:19,860
to a month later I finally kind of put

1163
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:21,540
out on Twitter that I'm looking for a

1164
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:23,880
mentor because I kind of hit a wall I

1165
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:26,340
needed some help Katie reach out and

1166
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:27,240
said cool how can I help and we just

1167
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:29,880
kind of took it off from there and

1168
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:32,220
that's a great point because like I know

1169
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:33,990
a lot of people industry and it hasn't

1170
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:35,580
sure all you do and I think that overall

1171
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:36,959
this industry has been one where if you

1172
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:38,190
have questions or you need help with

1173
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,470
something people are more than willing

1174
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:41,940
to help you out you know I've had some

1175
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:43,770
great conversations with people like a

1176
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:46,830
likes to jump on a phone for an hour and

1177
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:48,750
discuss this and you know this okay like

1178
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:50,730
you know people that are making a lot of

1179
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:52,200
money or like really busy successful to

1180
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:53,730
take me like an hour other day like you

1181
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,859
know Boeing some dude and like Maine to

1182
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:57,060
like have a conversation with them so

1183
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:59,070
many think that's like this industry

1184
00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:01,049
overall has been awesome from that

1185
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:03,300
perspective so don't be afraid to like

1186
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:05,790
ask people stuff you know go out there

1187
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:07,170
and like ask for help and you know it

1188
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:09,450
doesn't matter how famous there are you

1189
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:10,620
know like even Dave Kennedy's like all

1190
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:12,330
these news channels stuff like that like

1191
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:13,589
I've hit him up offline a few times for

1192
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:15,299
questions and he's always be like right

1193
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:16,680
there helping and I've seen the same

1194
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:18,180
thing I mean even building the InfoSec

1195
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,870
mentors project I mean Casey has been a

1196
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,460
main

1197
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:21,720
tribute or to my knowledge that has

1198
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,910
helped build that but I've reached out

1199
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:27,029
to folks like Apollo Clark Jack Daniel

1200
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:28,710
and I have almost always found that when

1201
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:31,170
someone has time to actually interact

1202
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:34,290
with you they are actually more than

1203
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:35,640
willing to help and so it's there's

1204
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:37,020
usually that hesitancy that kind of

1205
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,549
concern which is part of why I brought

1206
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:40,950
you know infants like mentors into being

1207
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:42,480
was hears people that are understanding

1208
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:43,830
that they are willing to provide some

1209
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,720
sort of guidance and there are people

1210
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:47,730
that want to learn and not actually led

1211
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:49,080
to him being on security weekly - yeah

1212
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:51,870
yeah that was around March night we

1213
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:52,980
should have that trouble taught them it

1214
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:58,400
was done so much we can't remember it

1215
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:58,400
all anybody question well thank you I

1216
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:28,350
mean it's um

1217
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:29,970
I don't say no um I am also getting into

1218
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:31,380
a process where I'm mentoring a good

1219
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:33,600
friend of mine who I've known for years

1220
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:36,330
shooters in California um but she's

1221
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:37,920
trying to get out of like a more InfoSec

1222
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:41,190
policy type role into something more

1223
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:43,410
technical and I've been got helping her

1224
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:45,450
and she's like yeah you know until we

1225
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:47,370
start talking she never like exploited a

1226
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:49,350
sequel injection you know something like

1227
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:51,540
that's a pretty wide skill gap right and

1228
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:53,819
I get value of that too because I'd only

1229
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:55,259
I mean all these things add up like

1230
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:57,150
every time I explain a sequel injection

1231
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:59,760
cross-site scripting even if it took a

1232
00:41:57,150 --> 00:42:01,980
basic like you know a wast 101 type

1233
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,210
thing it always adds to my ability to

1234
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:05,610
you know explain it further and

1235
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:07,470
sometimes stepping back into that really

1236
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:09,540
basic thing like it's great you know and

1237
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:11,819
I like doing that sometimes because it

1238
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:13,050
does help me kind of baseline like all

1239
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:14,520
right like what am I even doing because

1240
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:17,880
you can get really lost in those step

1241
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:20,340
fours pretty quickly and I've also found

1242
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:22,170
too so with my apprentice or my protege

1243
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:24,450
she's actually coming from a role where

1244
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:25,920
she was policy-based similar and she

1245
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:27,689
wants to go toward penetration testing

1246
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,120
and I think that one of the benefits of

1247
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:30,960
kind of sharing that knowledge is it

1248
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,410
doesn't necessarily have to be that

1249
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,030
you're just sharing to recognize

1250
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:35,350
he has with me for sometimes it's like

1251
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:37,660
these are the resources that I've used

1252
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:38,560
that have helped me like images you'll

1253
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:39,910
come back and ask questions about

1254
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,740
different things and it's just more of

1255
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:42,759
being like a guide like these are the

1256
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:44,290
points on the map that you want to make

1257
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:47,170
sure you touch upon to actually be

1258
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:48,310
successful and and so that relationship

1259
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:49,930
is a bit different than Casey and ours

1260
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:51,460
because that's more of like via email we

1261
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:53,379
actually just kind of will tweet at each

1262
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:54,460
other back and forth or writing emails

1263
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:57,490
to each other to kind of give that

1264
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:59,860
guidance if it was a more like regularly

1265
00:42:57,490 --> 00:43:02,080
paced type role I think that having that

1266
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:03,880
closer parity or at least having someone

1267
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,799
that is willing to do the work to learn

1268
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:08,350
those things is good but I don't think

1269
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:10,780
that necessarily having a you know vast

1270
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:12,190
gap in skills is a bad thing sometimes

1271
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:13,870
it's great because it will remind you of

1272
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:15,760
things that you may have forgotten but

1273
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:18,160
also I mean you have to you know it's

1274
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,330
small it seems like when I'm teaching my

1275
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,710
taught my programming class you know

1276
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:23,290
some people not really good at all just

1277
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:25,450
people like what what is programming it

1278
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:29,140
could be kind of difficult but it was

1279
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:31,839
valuing that too and so I mean I like

1280
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:33,609
yeah I I think it depends what you wanna

1281
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:35,020
get out of it you know honestly and if

1282
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:36,400
they if you're trying like really kind

1283
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:38,259
of build your own skills up and they'll

1284
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,460
find somebody that is more closer you

1285
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:41,530
know because he's already in security

1286
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:43,300
just a different aspect of it right says

1287
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:45,250
he'll be different than trying to help

1288
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:48,610
out somebody in college or you know even

1289
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:50,200
younger like getting into just security

1290
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:51,460
as a whole right

1291
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,689
however like when I was like younger

1292
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:54,520
like when I was like 12 I used to be

1293
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:56,050
like 2600 meetings in Minneapolis and

1294
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:57,940
like my older friends we drive like you

1295
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:59,440
drive in and you know run away from home

1296
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:01,150
and like we go to 2600 meetings I

1297
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,770
learned a lot from people they're just

1298
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:04,480
like you know where to go next you know

1299
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:07,420
build my first blue box for them and a

1300
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:10,510
lot of fun stuff so you can definitely

1301
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:15,000
learn from both sides of that followed

1302
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:15,000
brantford yeah

1303
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:33,330
I mean resources like I guess I should

1304
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:35,640
ask like on our is it more of like

1305
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:36,720
exploratory resources so like not really

1306
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:39,210
sure where I want to go or what I want

1307
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:41,910
to do or is it more like these are the

1308
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:51,840
books to pick up for this field versus

1309
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:53,759
this field versus another field so I

1310
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:55,650
think one of my general feedback for

1311
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,970
just about anybody and I know a few

1312
00:44:55,650 --> 00:45:00,119
people that have really benefited from

1313
00:44:56,970 --> 00:45:01,980
this as if to do well in this industry

1314
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:05,310
in general even if you're not just

1315
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:07,080
necessarily someone that does

1316
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:09,000
you know penetration testing learning to

1317
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:11,940
code at some level even if it's a very

1318
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,160
basic level is incredibly valuable I

1319
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:16,800
mean I know one one of our friends here

1320
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,819
Audie she didn't know Python she was

1321
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,470
doing a project that would have required

1322
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:21,599
her to be up at like all hours of the

1323
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:24,839
night due to the change control that she

1324
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:26,339
was tied to she took two hours to learn

1325
00:45:24,839 --> 00:45:29,130
Python and wrote a script and was able

1326
00:45:26,339 --> 00:45:31,759
to take a multi-day process down to a

1327
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:35,280
matter of hours that was all automated

1328
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:37,440
and I mean honestly from that knowledge

1329
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,190
you can gain so much more in this

1330
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,490
industry as a whole

1331
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:43,140
I definitely concur that like as a you

1332
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:44,759
know a penetration tester focused more

1333
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:47,670
on application security there have been

1334
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:50,460
times where my ability to code has led

1335
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:51,960
to me to actually able to exploit

1336
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:54,599
something that otherwise would have been

1337
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:56,460
there or even to find it so I got very

1338
00:45:54,599 --> 00:45:59,160
valuable and you know I would expect

1339
00:45:56,460 --> 00:46:00,900
anyone kind of coming in if I was hired

1340
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:02,460
as a hiring manager and I was looking

1341
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:03,900
for some apps like people even on the

1342
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,970
network side I expect them to be at

1343
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:07,440
least be able to code a little bit

1344
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:09,049
enough to you know make some HTTP

1345
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,070
requests and modify I'm you know I mean

1346
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:12,720
stuff like that it doesn't have to be a

1347
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:16,650
building entire like web applications

1348
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:19,759
but that also I mean has a great you

1349
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:22,619
know has a lot to teach you about

1350
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:24,000
security as well you know it's like you

1351
00:46:22,619 --> 00:46:24,970
can't really secure network unless you

1352
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,750
know how to build networks

1353
00:46:24,970 --> 00:46:29,919
but uh I as far as I mean exploratory

1354
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:31,090
research and I don't know if there's

1355
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,349
anything that out there like if

1356
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:34,599
somebody's like I don't know if I'm

1357
00:46:32,349 --> 00:46:35,980
gonna be a pen tester you guys just like

1358
00:46:34,599 --> 00:46:37,180
kind of looking in and meeting people

1359
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:38,940
that are doing that work and like

1360
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:44,259
getting kind of lowdown from them and

1361
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:47,470
there's a library IT so CY BR ary IIT

1362
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:50,200
has it's all free content and they have

1363
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:52,180
you know multi-hour training courses to

1364
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:53,950
cover anything from your A+ all the way

1365
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:56,020
through like your network plus through

1366
00:46:53,950 --> 00:46:59,109
your I think they have some stuff now on

1367
00:46:56,020 --> 00:47:00,580
CGH so certified ethical hacker if a

1368
00:46:59,109 --> 00:47:03,130
person is just like I don't know where I

1369
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:04,830
want to go and what I want to do but I'd

1370
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:07,450
like to get into the security space

1371
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:09,369
going in and exploring those and finding

1372
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:11,618
what they think is interesting grabbing

1373
00:47:09,369 --> 00:47:13,390
books I mean there is an ungodly number

1374
00:47:11,619 --> 00:47:15,670
book no starch press is like another

1375
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:18,460
place that I my bookshelf is almost all

1376
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:20,410
no search press books in security that

1377
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:22,240
I've purchased quite a lot and there's a

1378
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:23,618
lot of I mean there's app sack there's

1379
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:26,410
penetration testing which is maybe not

1380
00:47:23,619 --> 00:47:28,570
fully app sack there's software security

1381
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:31,000
which is more of like code auditing yeah

1382
00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:33,430
I mean all the way through policy all

1383
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,990
the way through even just doing like

1384
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:38,440
vulnerability management and and there's

1385
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:39,910
a parent layer to on like security jobs

1386
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:41,470
that don't necessarily aren't technical

1387
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:42,819
I mean because like we need those out of

1388
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:43,959
your company needs so same people that

1389
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:45,790
can speak to people who are not

1390
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:47,830
technical right so just you know

1391
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:49,779
security is really broad area I'm just

1392
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:52,390
like okay you're dr. awesome what kind

1393
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:53,560
and so I mean I think this would come in

1394
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:54,790
to places like this and talk to people

1395
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:57,970
and medium like figure out like what is

1396
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:59,650
it you actually do and you know the

1397
00:47:57,970 --> 00:48:01,868
consultant life isn't for everybody you

1398
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:03,730
know some people really great it I not a

1399
00:48:01,869 --> 00:48:05,470
policy person there's no way I'd ever be

1400
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:07,540
I'm not working internally somewhere

1401
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:09,040
that's just I'm not cut out for that but

1402
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:10,900
there's some people I really like that

1403
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:12,369
type of environment and so I mean I

1404
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:13,420
think that it's you know important for

1405
00:48:12,369 --> 00:48:15,130
people to get out there and explore and

1406
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:17,880
see what they're you know interested in

1407
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:17,880
and comfortable with

1408
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:38,540
over the wire yeah over the wire I think

1409
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:40,430
zorg I'm not sure but so that's

1410
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:42,170
definitely there are so for example

1411
00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:45,710
there are just if you had a like CTF

1412
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:47,570
time might be CTF - time if they wanted

1413
00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:48,710
like explore some they're like those are

1414
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:50,840
all over the others there might be a

1415
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:54,140
little somebody's learner that might be

1416
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:55,970
a little much like for there's a you

1417
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:58,868
know some of basic Pluralsight courses

1418
00:48:55,970 --> 00:49:01,730
on you know it's like The Lost top-10 I

1419
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:02,750
the Olaf stuff is great I mean you're

1420
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:04,100
there some projects that are also

1421
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:05,990
different projects are kind of you know

1422
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:07,790
already but they will branch out to a

1423
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:10,129
lot all of them are going to require

1424
00:49:07,790 --> 00:49:13,130
some technical knowledge into some you

1425
00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:15,170
know of guides and tutorials on doing

1426
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:16,670
stuff they're just a lot of people

1427
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:17,750
written a lot of blog articles too so

1428
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:19,550
you can generally find stuff but the

1429
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:20,720
trick is then to take that basic

1430
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:21,590
information and really kind of

1431
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,569
extrapolate from that and like

1432
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:25,550
understand what's going on so then you

1433
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:26,930
can apply it somewhere else because yeah

1434
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:28,310
honestly like most of those are lots of

1435
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:29,720
examples like in sequel injection or

1436
00:49:28,310 --> 00:49:30,710
whatever like I mean they're you're not

1437
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:33,379
really going to find stuff that's

1438
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:35,359
exploitable like that anymore but

1439
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:36,950
knowing how it's exploitable like why

1440
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:39,770
that's working is important because

1441
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:41,689
that's even come to help like my the

1442
00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:43,220
MongoDB stuff I was working on you know

1443
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:44,990
it was completely different platform but

1444
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:46,580
the knowledge and the understanding of

1445
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:48,560
like this is how something is

1446
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:50,960
exploitable and how I would explain it

1447
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:52,490
works so that also development

1448
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,630
background like you know being knowing

1449
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:55,549
that how to write code and develop that

1450
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:59,720
stuff like directly made that possible

1451
00:49:55,550 --> 00:50:02,660
as well so I just yeah start there and

1452
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:04,310
keep going there's a are some books on

1453
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:06,830
it there's like a web application

1454
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:08,359
hacker's handbook so few years old now

1455
00:50:06,830 --> 00:50:10,430
but I mean still want to only really

1456
00:50:08,359 --> 00:50:14,840
good ones out there on application

1457
00:50:10,430 --> 00:50:17,089
security specific stuff but I mean I

1458
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:19,220
guess we could talk more maybe come up

1459
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:22,910
with some more resources but the cyber

1460
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:26,080
cell or else I'd not sure what of sands

1461
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:26,080
yeah yeah

1462
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:36,360
yeah all the Web Apps stuff yep yeah so

1463
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:38,100
yeah the SANS Institute is amazing for

1464
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:41,160
as a resource to guide you to other

1465
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:42,900
resources I heard like vlog number

1466
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:44,819
ticket exams classes are pretty pricey

1467
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:45,810
but if you have you know the ability to

1468
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:49,020
do them I've heard really great things

1469
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:50,340
about a lot of them so so I think with

1470
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:51,420
that we're actually just about running

1471
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:53,880
out of time here we probably have time

1472
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:55,770
for Casey to wrap up Casey and I are

1473
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:57,990

1474
00:50:55,770 --> 00:51:00,660

1475
00:50:57,990 --> 00:51:02,069

1476
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:03,629

1477
00:51:02,070 --> 00:51:06,810
happy to you know provide feedback as

1478
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:08,750
well in person or Twitter so I know that

1479
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:13,049
we're both getting active there as well

1480
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:15,480
so yeah all right so in closing you know

1481
00:51:13,050 --> 00:51:17,040
to consider I think mentorship is very

1482
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:18,810
valuable to our community and it's the

1483
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:21,450
only way we're going to grow the people

1484
00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:22,650
we need as a consultant

1485
00:51:21,450 --> 00:51:24,450
you know hiring apps like people it's

1486
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:26,280
like alright we need people who are

1487
00:51:24,450 --> 00:51:28,169
doing application security or want to or

1488
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:29,220
do network security and a lot of the

1489
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:30,720
time you're not going to get somebody

1490
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:33,089
who's experience coming in they're going

1491
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,140
to be you know very new or potentially

1492
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:36,960
you know first thing they're really

1493
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:38,250
doing so I think this is super valuable

1494
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,210
to our community we need to do more of

1495
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:41,970
it it's the only way we're going to

1496
00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:45,210
handle fixing that knowledge gap and

1497
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:46,980
unemployment gap but it is also work you

1498
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:49,800
know it takes time it takes energy and

1499
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:51,660
it's also fun and so I highly encourage

1500
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:53,280
anyone you know who's interested to try

1501

1503
00:51:54,690 --> 00:52:00,480
