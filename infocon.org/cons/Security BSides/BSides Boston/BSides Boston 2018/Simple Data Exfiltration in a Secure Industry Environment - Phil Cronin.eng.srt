1
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:14,980
this is my my third b-sides and I just

2
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:16,259
want to thank you know Dan and all the

3
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:19,500
other

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,939
put these b-sides on because this this

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,380
session has been better than the last

6
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:25,680
one and which was better than the one

7
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:28,979
before I'm just so impressed at how good

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,080
these b-sides conferences are so so

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:35,030
really they know thanks thanks to the

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:38,849
folks that put in all the work he's so

11
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:41,190
my colleagues wanted me to title the

12
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,440
this presentation differently they

13
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:47,699
wanted me to call it data exfiltration

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:50,370
for dummies but I thought that may not

15
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:53,010
be very good with my professional

16
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,660
standing so I gave it an innocuous name

17
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,989
a name that you will you'll never

18
00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:00,959
remember but the premise of the talk is

19
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:04,589
that there's lots and lots of ways that

20
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:07,159
you can exfiltrate data even significant

21
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:10,500
amounts of data from from relatively

22
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:16,470
secure networks I'm going to be talking

23
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:20,300
about you know are our top 12 and what I

24
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:23,640
find is that when I first go to a client

25
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:26,000
six eight of these top twelve will

26
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,440
always work so it's it's pretty common

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,170
the these these things can be carried

28
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:33,270
out by non-technical users with no

29
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:36,000
elevated privileges I'm not even talking

30
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:39,449
about local admin privileges it's very

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,310
very simple to be done importantly it's

32
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:45,240
unlikely to be detected by the

33
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:48,410
organization in in real-time or even in

34
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:53,570
in kind of the event monitoring stuff

35
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:55,920
there it's it's widely effective across

36
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:58,380
virtually all of the networks that I'm

37
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,030
going to be in it's it's not zero day or

38
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,369
any of the heady stuff that you you know

39
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,380
you've been hearing about today the

40
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,790
reason for the talk actually my

41
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:09,288
motivation is that there's very very

42
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:11,310
little awareness of these

43
00:02:09,288 --> 00:02:12,629
susceptibilities that's probably not a

44
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:16,980
word I want to use because I can't say

45
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:18,989
yeah among IT practitioners and what's

46
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,480
clear to me is that if you're not aware

47
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:23,099
of these susceptibilities they're not

48
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,230
going to be fixed that's not just that

49
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:29,000
the next roll out of some one of the

50
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:32,760
systems is going to happen too

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,650
pick this up okay so so it's really kind

52
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,870
of a bold premise on my part to say that

53
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,690
it's it's so easy to be done I mean what

54
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:42,810
makes me say that just a quick

55
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:47,640
background on me I'm an IT Auditor no

56
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:50,070
booing please and I've been running with

57
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:53,369
with my colleagues a you know a Bowtique

58
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:56,549
II type of IT audit firm we do some

59
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:58,890
direct audits but most of us most of the

60
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:02,730
work that we do is is is outsourced by

61
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:04,619
two CPA firms and some other firms so in

62
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:08,940
the in the last two years I've done

63
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:11,570
about a hundred hi audits that's one a

64
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:14,490
week and boy it feels like one a week

65
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:16,109
it's it's predominantly in in regulated

66
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:18,840
industries because those are the only

67
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:21,510
people that are gonna pay for audit so

68
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,850
it's financial institutions banks and

69
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:26,399
credit unions health care hospitals

70
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:29,160
health centers and to a much lesser

71
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:34,080
degree these other areas I have never

72
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:36,420
been to a defense network so I'm sure

73
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:40,530
that those are much better off than the

74
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:46,230
financial stuff yeah okay so the

75
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:49,080
assumptions again I'm talking about an

76
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:51,060
environment in which security is is is

77
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,280
mandated meaning that they have

78
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:55,709
requirements to protect the data on

79
00:03:53,280 --> 00:04:00,030
their network so they're supposed to be

80
00:03:55,709 --> 00:04:01,230
taking it seriously the user that I'm

81
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:03,120
looking at that's going to be

82
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:06,329
exfiltrating the data has no technical

83
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:09,390
training no elevated privileges the data

84
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:11,580
set size could be you know megabytes up

85
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:14,429
to a gigabytes but you know I'm not

86
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,260
addressing how the the user the

87
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,940
malicious user is getting the data I'm

88
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:20,099
assuming that they have some sort of

89
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:21,870
privileges on applications and some

90
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,760
harder that they can get to the data set

91
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:25,470
and once they have that data set there

92
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:29,270
they're just trying to figure out how to

93
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:31,440
get it out and do something with it it

94
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:33,810
organizational detection and what I mean

95
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,990
by here is is that that it's detection

96
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:38,950
by the organization

97
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:41,830
via their routine systems the routine

98
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:43,810
alerting systems or even their event

99
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:46,030
monitoring which which might take place

100
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:49,240
you know a day or two or even up to a

101
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:50,979
week later I'm not talking about the

102
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,650
situation that after the data breach

103
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:56,170
occurs that 18 months later their

104
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:58,210
customers find out and it hits the press

105
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:00,280
and then mandiant and Verizon are all

106
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:02,710
and they're doing their forensics and so

107
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:05,200
I'm talking about a detection by the

108
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:07,060
organization using their normal methods

109
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,370
not not forensics though I mean the

110
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:13,690
physical guys can you know do some

111
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:15,370
amazing stuff so okay there are typical

112
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:17,890
typical environment Windows 7

113
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:19,860
workstations in a Windows 7 networking

114
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:22,000
environment pushing typical policies

115
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:24,280
I've already talked about you know it's

116
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,360
a standard user level web content

117
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:29,530
filtering and I've seen them all

118
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,660
endpoint protection systems that are

119
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:35,369
going to be restricting read and writes

120
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:38,140
on USB storage devices and CDs

121
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:40,560
anti-virus system you know operational

122
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:43,390
patching systems for Windows and

123
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,730
third-party apps and I'm assuming that

124
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:47,650
that's all up to date centralized

125
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:50,440
security event monitoring and and

126
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:53,950
alerting frameworks I'm not addressing

127
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:56,650
data exfiltration by it by email or you

128
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:58,390
know someone using an ssl VPN or you

129
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:03,820
know their mobile phone or you know

130
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:06,430
getting doing a bypass on an MDM okay so

131
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:11,740
the the the top 12 that I'm talking

132
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:14,980
about I've categorized into into bypass

133
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:18,190
methods the first one is is is bypassing

134
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:20,680
the endpoint protection system so that

135
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:22,240
you can get to rogue storage device the

136
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,590
next one is bypassing perimeter

137
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,320
protection so you can get direct access

138
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:28,570
to the Internet the third one is

139
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,280
bypassing web content filtering systems

140
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:32,610
so that you can get to websites that

141
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:37,780
would allow you to exfiltrate data

142
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:42,850
bypassing firewalls and then bypassing

143
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:45,609
total network control fully okay so

144
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:47,850
starting off this is the first two this

145
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:51,820
is bypassing endpoint protection systems

146
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:54,790
over on the right I have a little threat

147
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:57,940
index so the frequency of occurrence is

148
00:06:54,790 --> 00:07:00,700
how often I see it and the

149
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:03,610
organizational detection is how often

150
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:06,490
when I'm testing I get caught okay

151
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:08,050
because I test these things these are

152
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:10,810
all things that I've actually done on

153
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:13,180
real networks it's not like my home

154
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:16,450
networks I'm doing this I get to go in

155
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:18,669
as an auditor and do things that other

156
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:20,349
people aren't allowed to do so I'm

157
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:22,120
really talking about and it's something

158
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:23,980
that's very common and very unlikely to

159
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,830
be detected I consider that a high risk

160
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:29,260
so the first the first one is probably

161
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:31,510
the simplest one and and this one almost

162
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:33,730
always works that is you take your

163
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:36,700
Android phone this is not gonna work

164
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:38,530
with your iPhone you plug you plug it in

165
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:41,289
and it and it shows up as a network

166
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:44,099
adapter okay you double-click on it

167
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:48,010
and that network adapter magically turns

168
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:49,630
yeah magically to see that I love it

169
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:51,190
when people say that you know they

170
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:53,680
already know about this yeah it

171
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:54,610
magically turns into it i USB device

172
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,380
okay

173
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:59,680
so what's what's what's fascinating

174
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:03,820
about that is is that this this bypass

175
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:06,669
works even in the presence of endpoint

176
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:09,729
protection systems which have all which

177
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:13,450
have intentionally or tried to lock down

178
00:08:09,729 --> 00:08:15,520
USB storage devices okay so I'm not

179
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:17,110
saying this isn't like a home network

180
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,549
where where you're actually just you

181
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:20,979
know just plugging into your home this

182
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:24,580
is where people are consciously have

183
00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:27,219
already tried to to shut this down so

184
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:29,349
why does it work well part of the reason

185
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:33,070
that it works is because it shows up as

186
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:35,289
a media device first and then

187
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:38,020
importantly the drivers are already

188
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:40,510
loaded it's not as if you need it's not

189
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:42,689
as if you need drivers for this these

190
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:45,160
particular USB devices so matter act

191
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:47,140
it'll try to update the drivers if you

192
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,550
if you try to if you allow it to update

193
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,890
it'll block it because you don't have

194
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:52,899
a local administrative control but the

195
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:55,420
point is is is that when you plug it in

196
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:56,800
it works now you have to be patient

197
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:58,779
because it's going to try to index the

198
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:03,250
phone and if you're using large you know

199
00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:05,589
cards it's going to be it's going to

200
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:07,060
take a while to index it but this one

201
00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:10,000
works almost all the time and it's it's

202
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:14,439
just it's just such a such a simple one

203
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,089
and in terms of detection again I get

204
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:19,660
the chance to play with this stuff I

205
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:22,149
have never been caught I just hadn't it

206
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:23,920
is it's it's it's it and and evan is an

207
00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:25,870
auditor I actually looked through their

208
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,120
what they are doing to see whether or

209
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:30,279
not they're actually doing the types of

210
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,829
alerting and inspections of their logs

211
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:34,120
is supposed to be doing now I find it in

212
00:09:32,829 --> 00:09:36,640
the logs obviously because I'm looking

213
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,740
for it but in terms of their the types

214
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:42,970
of alerting that they are normally doing

215
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:44,950
it's it doesn't show up so and even even

216
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:46,600
you know when they do their their their

217
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:48,910
their reviews a couple weeks and why

218
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:52,660
because there's not there's nothing

219
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:54,939
that's getting blocked here so to stop

220
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,199
this one it's actually pretty tough so

221
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:59,529
even if you're using you know the

222
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:01,779
dimensions or you know GFI or semantic

223
00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:03,520
or whatever you have to you have to make

224
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:05,890
sure that you're stopping this but you

225
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,899
often have to push out policies you know

226
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:10,390
by way of GPO is in order to in order to

227
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:12,339
it's like a belt and suspenders you know

228
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:14,860
it's it's not easy to it's not easy to

229
00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:17,220
just to stop this one this next one this

230
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:20,050
next one I I find really amusing because

231
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:22,690
I've never really figured out I've never

232
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:24,640
been able to use a Bluetooth file

233
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:28,480
transfer for anything useful

234
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:30,730
other than data exfiltration so here you

235
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,790
plug you plug you plug a legacy

236
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:35,949
Bluetooth device in wide legacy because

237
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:38,079
the drivers are loaded why all right

238
00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:39,849
well because you don't need local admin

239
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,099
privileges and and then all of a sudden

240
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:44,560
this thing you know pops up and it says

241
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:47,290
yeah I'm a I'm a Bluetooth device let me

242
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,630
pair to well what of course you pair to

243
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:51,250
your phone now it's secure because you

244
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:52,959
have to put the pin in so that the

245
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,190
transfer from the workstation to your

246
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:58,359
phone is going to be very very very

247
00:10:54,190 --> 00:11:00,970
secure but but it again it works very

248
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:03,699
very well very rarely do I

249
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:06,639
see that there's even an attempt to

250
00:11:03,699 --> 00:11:07,300
block Bluetooth devices because USB

251
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:09,910
devices

252
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:12,609
you know they they're all identified

253
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:15,009
differently I mean the storage devices

254
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:16,509
hid devices Bluetooth devices network

255
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:19,350
adapters they all show up differently

256
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:22,480
right no one thinks about stopping a a

257
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:25,000
Bluetooth device because they're useless

258
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:28,720
right except if you want to exfiltrate

259
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,970
data in terms of the detection again as

260
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,819
they say I have the opportunity to play

261
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:36,279
I've never been I've never been picked

262
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:39,120
up on it and there's no perimeter record

263
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:43,449
here so it's not going out through a

264
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:45,790
it's not going out through a firewall or

265
00:11:43,449 --> 00:11:47,019
whatever no forensic ly I'm not trying

266
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:48,310
to say that that this couldn't be

267
00:11:47,019 --> 00:11:51,430
detected because I mean it's going to

268
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:53,649
show up and in in some windows event

269
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:55,839
logs that there was something insert I'm

270
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:58,720
not saying that but these are not the

271
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,279
type of events they're got that are

272
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,589
going to go to the network operating

273
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:04,569
center and someone's saying you know

274
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:05,889
someone just did something that you know

275
00:12:04,569 --> 00:12:07,569
I'm gonna go down to their desk and find

276
00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:15,459
out what the it was going on

277
00:12:07,569 --> 00:12:17,949
so okay all right so so that this next

278
00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:20,349
one is is bypassing the perimeter

279
00:12:17,949 --> 00:12:22,599
protections altogether and again you can

280
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:26,199
see my thread index over here this one

281
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:28,089
is again extremely common and I've never

282
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:30,219
been picked up on it and and what you do

283
00:12:28,089 --> 00:12:32,920
here is you plug the device in then you

284
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:34,660
put your phone into tethering mode well

285
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:39,099
all of a sudden you phone then shows up

286
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:41,319
as a NIC adapter okay and guess what the

287
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:44,559
NIC adapters have already been

288
00:12:41,319 --> 00:12:46,809
pre-loaded and into into Windows 7 so no

289
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:49,180
administrative privileges are necessary

290
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:51,730
in order to make this work if it asks

291
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:53,739
you to update the the drivers don't do

292
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:55,000
it because then you'll get blocked but

293
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:57,209
you don't have to update the drivers

294
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:04,630
because the ones that are installed work

295
00:12:57,209 --> 00:13:07,300
beautifully so again

296
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:09,010
as a nick device this is going to work

297
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:11,040
even in the presence of in point control

298
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:15,060
where you're where you're blocking say

299
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:19,780
USB storage devices okay the next one

300
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:21,099
the next one is is similar but it's it's

301
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:23,430
a it's a little bit different and and

302
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:27,730
this is my favorite d-link

303
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:29,530
USB NIC device and again why did I

304
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:32,740
choose this one it's because it's legacy

305
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:36,130
the drivers are already there and this

306
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:38,620
one is is is even better I don't think

307
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:42,760
I've ever been stopped using this one

308
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:44,620
until the you know I mean if go back the

309
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,689
next year sometimes they stopped me but

310
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:48,910
you know but I've never been stopped and

311
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:52,060
first try on using this thing so you

312
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:52,900
know 20 bucks data exfiltration to your

313
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,849
heart's content

314
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:58,840
the only problem there is you have to

315
00:13:54,850 --> 00:14:01,090
use your phone as a Wi-Fi hotspot right

316
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:04,390
so that so that you can you know they

317
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:07,870
you know bypass the perimeter and go

318
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:10,360
directly out to your wrong you know to

319
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:11,560
the internet directly the only thing

320
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,600
that I would say here that sometimes

321
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:16,660
happens and this is about fifty fifty

322
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:22,030
percent of the time it that is when you

323
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:25,420
have both NICs active sometimes one of

324
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:27,130
them won't be active so you have to the

325
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:31,060
the you might actually have to unplug

326
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:33,460
the the rj45 cable to deactivate the

327
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:35,800
network and then that makes this one

328
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:37,030
active on the workstation all that means

329
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,620
is if you're going to do the data

330
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:40,540
exfiltration you'd have to take your

331
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:42,790
data set that you want to exfiltrate put

332
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:45,069
it on the C Drive and then exfiltrate it

333
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:46,839
it's one more step but if you're trying

334
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:51,310
to exfiltrate data you've probably got

335
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:54,610
the time right so so again endpoint

336
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:59,229
protection systems are unlikely to alert

337
00:14:54,610 --> 00:15:03,190
unriddle was a question oh sorry

338
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:04,810
on an allowed event again the the events

339
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:06,730
going to be logged but it's not going to

340
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:09,760
raise anybody's concern because it's

341
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:12,529
it's it's it's an okay event and here

342
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:15,769
there's no perimeter protection

343
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:18,740
detection whatsoever a record okay so

344
00:15:15,769 --> 00:15:20,660
I've already showed you pictures oh I

345
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:23,149
forgot I forgot this the built-in

346
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:25,459
adapter hey so a couple of years ago

347
00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:29,480
people were going crazy updating their

348
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:31,609
workstations from from XP to Windows 7 I

349
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,110
mean everybody everybody waited to the

350
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:36,680
last month or two to get it done I don't

351
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:42,709
know why but but a lot of folks bought

352
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:44,209
these cheap lenovo thinkcentre things I

353
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:45,768
mean I I just see them all the time

354
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:47,989
they're about this big they stand on the

355
00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:50,300
desk it's it's a it's a really nice

356
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:52,850
little package it's good I think it's an

357
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:55,758
AI one with like a gig of ram and it

358
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:58,490
comes equipped with with the CDs and

359
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:00,889
that was a joke incidentally it comes

360
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:05,540
equipped with with a DVD writer and a

361
00:16:00,889 --> 00:16:07,610
built-in Wi-Fi NIC card well in the rush

362
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:12,189
to to push all these things out

363
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:13,880
they never disabled the the built-in

364
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:17,180
Wi-Fi NIC

365
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:19,069
so I find that if if those little things

366
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,630
are sitting there they often have the

367
00:16:19,069 --> 00:16:22,099
NIC cards and then what you do is you

368
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:23,300
just you just enable them you don't even

369
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,040
have to do anything you don't plug

370
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:30,790
anything they're already there you just

371
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:32,990
use your your phone as as a as a hotspot

372
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:35,050
okay so that's what that picture was

373
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:39,230
there in the middle one that's there

374
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:43,339
okay bypassing web content filtering

375
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:45,260
systems and again I there's a lot of web

376
00:16:43,339 --> 00:16:48,709
content filtering systems I have I've

377
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:51,709
gotten to probably see most of them one

378
00:16:48,709 --> 00:16:54,290
of the most common bypasses that I see

379
00:16:51,709 --> 00:16:56,869
is is that the web content filtering

380
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:59,839
system is set up to allow things like

381
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:03,439
Bomgar or log me in or go to my PC our

382
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:05,419
TeamViewer because there's there's a bit

383
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:07,849
of a mistaken belief that's you know it

384
00:17:05,419 --> 00:17:09,770
might it might be necessary so what you

385
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:12,379
do is is you you go to one of these

386
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:15,520
sites you there's a free account if you

387
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:18,130
want to you you set it up and then

388
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,230
you you can exfiltrate data using these

389
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:21,970
these remote control devices

390
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:25,060
I assume everybody's familiar with these

391
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:26,860
things this isn't working quite as well

392
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:29,500
as it used to because there's some

393
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:31,719
ActiveX stuff that's now needs to be

394
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:35,110
installed to do the transfer so I think

395
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:37,870
I think Bomgar and TeamViewer are

396
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:41,199
working the best but usually I'm finding

397
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:42,790
now sometimes the ActiveX controls are

398
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,100
still getting installed even without

399
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:46,840
local admin privileges I don't quite get

400
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,730
it I know there's some weird stuff going

401
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,120
on with the enterprise versions but it

402
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:51,880
ain't right

403
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:54,669
that that's still a good one if you want

404
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:58,540
it this next one is new and and that is

405
00:17:54,670 --> 00:18:03,520
I'm seeing I'm seeing customers going

406
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:06,070
out to use office 365 for their email so

407
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,139
that means that they they they use the

408
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:10,710
browser and that they have to get out to

409
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:14,140
office 365 com

410
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:17,350
ok I get it so they open that up but

411
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:20,260
Microsoft in order for that to work also

412
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:24,070
requires you to open up the dot live and

413
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:25,690
the dot office I don't get why but they

414
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:27,580
do now

415
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:28,840
everybody probably has a dot live and a

416
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:31,600
dot off as a cop because if you're

417
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:34,570
running Windows 10 right it's like I

418
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,699
mean they nag you to do one of these

419
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:38,470
Microsoft accounts that gives you you

420
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,600
know one of these accounts so the whole

421
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:42,490
point here is you've already got a free

422
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,899
account that that you're going to be

423
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:46,780
able to use now you're not gonna be able

424
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:49,330
to exfiltrate lots of data all it was

425
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:50,710
but you know 10 Meg at a time or 20 mega

426
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:53,770
at a time or whatever it is is you know

427
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:56,140
you can get some get some real stuff and

428
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:59,050
further you could have an office 365

429
00:18:56,140 --> 00:19:02,470
account yourself like like I do so what

430
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:03,850
I'm a my customers I could just log on

431
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:06,670
to my own account

432
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:09,280
and exfiltrate did it if I wish this

433
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:11,470
next one is is is is is really insidious

434
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,480
and and that is web content filtering

435
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:19,060
systems often default to allowing

436
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:22,510
uncatted or unrated sites and the reason

437
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:23,659
for that is because people complain that

438
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:26,480
if they go to one of the

439
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:29,840
we at sites like the New York Times or

440
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,700
whatever if you if you block on

441
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:36,110
categorized sites all that crap that

442
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:37,820
comes from the from the the advertisers

443
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:39,530
it all gets blocks and it makes the

444
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:42,620
website look really really really ugly

445
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:44,720
so so the IT puts this stuff back well

446
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:47,419
what does this mean what this means is

447
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,370
is is is that if you register a new site

448
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:52,070
for like five bucks or whatever it costs

449
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:56,810
you and GoDaddy you can you can bypass

450
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:58,220
this or let's say let's say if you you

451
00:19:56,810 --> 00:20:00,409
know want to find a new file sharing

452
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:02,750
system a file sharing site I mean how

453
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:04,850
many of those are coming on the market

454
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:06,290
now I mean it's a new one every week all

455
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:08,689
you have to do is go out to the new one

456
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:10,550
it's not going to be categorized it's a

457
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:12,350
file sharing site it probably is going

458
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:14,180
to give you a free account just to test

459
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:16,159
it so that you can you know exfiltrate

460
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:18,440
your data from from from from your

461
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:21,290
secure network to a free account and

462
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:22,940
there you go so actually this one's

463
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:25,100
really insidious when we do social

464
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:27,230
engineering we always get a new account

465
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:29,570
right we you know get a new five dollar

466
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:32,510
account we send that we send that link

467
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:35,450
and in the email boom they click on the

468
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:37,010
link there's no controls that link is

469
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:40,100
wide open because they don't they don't

470
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:43,450
block it it son cat so I mean this this

471
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:48,350
actually is is is a really serious

472
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:50,480
control weakness okay so here the the

473
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:51,830
the the possibilities of organizational

474
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,690
detection is a little bit higher because

475
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:56,300
you're going to be you're going to be in

476
00:20:53,690 --> 00:21:01,790
there in the logs in terms of where you

477
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:04,040
went to and and and what you saw but

478
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:07,280
again and unless you abuse it and show

479
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:10,970
up as hitting a lot of improper sites

480
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:14,270
you're probably going to not get caught

481
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:16,130
again I do this all the time and I've

482
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:24,070
never had anybody come to the desk where

483
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:26,780
I'm auditing ok bypassing firewalls and

484
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:29,570
you know if this was two or three years

485
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:31,190
ago I probably wouldn't have included

486
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:34,129
this slide because it would not have

487
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:36,330
been consistent with that this has to be

488
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:43,230
a non-technical user

489
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:46,470
okay so so in terms of setting up an FTP

490
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:47,909
FTP server to exfiltrate data to a

491
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:49,409
couple of years ago I would say that

492
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:51,870
that's in the realm of the more

493
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:54,149
technically sophisticated no longer

494
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:56,399
right because I mean I didn't know last

495
00:21:54,149 --> 00:21:57,899
year I went out and I think I dropped 50

496
00:21:56,399 --> 00:22:00,870
bucks I got one of these neck here

497
00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:03,719
cheapo routers you plug your USB device

498
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:06,570
into it and and all of a sudden that USB

499
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:10,950
device pops up on on the external net as

500
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:13,830
an FTP server right it required you know

501
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:16,440
I was maybe two points to point and

502
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:20,580
clicks in order for me with this $50

503
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:22,649
server to all of a sudden have a an FTP

504
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:24,870
server that I could have and it even

505
00:22:22,649 --> 00:22:25,889
gave me dynamic DNS right so I didn't

506
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:28,139
even have to remember what the IP

507
00:22:25,889 --> 00:22:31,469
address if I if I didn't ever have a

508
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:34,469
static so I consider now FTP in the in

509
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:41,130
the realm of of a of an FTP server in

510
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:43,470
the realm of a non-technical user so

511
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:46,470
what I again what I find is is that FTP

512
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:48,090
is is is often not blocked and sometimes

513
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:49,769
it's not restricted by a source and

514
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:52,289
destination address so if you happen to

515
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:55,889
be on our workstation where it's not not

516
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:57,870
properly locked down golden and again if

517
00:22:55,889 --> 00:22:59,969
if the firewall is allowing it yeah

518
00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:04,739
they'll be a record but again no no

519
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:06,600
alerts RDP again I'd say is is is now in

520
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:08,820
the realm of the non-technical user and

521
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:11,610
what do I mean by that that same $50

522
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:12,960
Netgear thing allowed me to do port

523
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:17,070
forwarding okay

524
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:22,740
holy smokes so for two clicks I was able

525
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:26,039
to forward 3389 to my crappy laptop why

526
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:28,350
I also forwarded 80 you know to the

527
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:31,110
Crockers laptop to the you know 3389 so

528
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:35,189
that I could connect to RDP on its

529
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:36,809
normal you know port 3389 or if they did

530
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:39,210
some outbound filtering which they often

531
00:23:36,809 --> 00:23:41,970
don't do anyways because they're very

532
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:43,650
pour that out filtering I could I could

533
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:45,950
always use the universal by passport

534
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:48,450
right eighty and and it's not like FTP

535
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:50,160
where you need multiple ports which is a

536
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:52,260
much more complex thing so I mean I

537
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:54,330
don't even try to you know put it you

538
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:56,310
know FTP you know over port 80 or it's

539
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:58,860
not something that so this works

540
00:23:56,310 --> 00:24:00,600
beautifully it works beautifully and RDP

541
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:03,240
right all you have to do is drag and

542
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:07,260
drop onto the the remote are deed if you

543
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:08,760
you know desktop so I don't know I think

544
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:12,060
everybody knows that Windows explorers

545
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:13,350
is a full FTP client allowing uploading

546
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:15,120
and downloading so you have to use

547
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:18,240
Windows Explorer if you want to the FTP

548
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:20,729
thing the port forwarding you know

549
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,710
point-and-click the detection no

550
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:24,090
alerting is likely I mean it you you are

551
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:27,360
going to have a record of the connection

552
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:30,290
but it's not going to be it's not going

553
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:33,320
to have the you know the security guys

554
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:35,700
knocking at your desk

555
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:37,649
alright this next one this next one

556
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:40,680
should not even be here this next one I

557
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:42,630
think is is is one of the most

558
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:46,850
ridiculous things that that continues to

559
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:51,840
plague our industry and and and that is

560
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:54,570
booting from from from a live CD or USB

561
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:57,600
device and the reason that I have this

562
00:24:54,570 --> 00:25:00,210
one here is because this is no longer

563
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,850
that you know booting from a USB device

564
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:06,480
or creating a you a bootable USB device

565
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:08,429
is no longer just among the technical

566
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:12,420
realm right because you can get Windows

567
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:15,930
8 on a on a bootable device you can get

568
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:19,680
Windows 10 hundred bucks iron key will

569
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:22,020
sell you bootable Windows 10 you know

570
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:24,630
the the use of you know Linux Mint or

571
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:26,430
puppy or whatever your favorite version

572
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:29,610
is right I mean how difficult is it to

573
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:31,620
make to make a bootable Linux device and

574
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:33,090
some of those you know to the

575
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:35,250
non-technical user are going to feel

576
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:39,750
very very very homey like like like like

577
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:44,220
Windows so it's very rare that I find

578
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:47,760
that networks have actually locked their

579
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:49,740
their BIOS is down and further if

580
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,360
they've locked their BIOS is down the

581
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,820
they often don't lock their boot order

582
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,330
correct

583
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:57,908
so it'll still allow booting to a live

584
00:25:55,330 --> 00:26:00,158
CD well because it's not a it's not a

585
00:25:57,909 --> 00:26:02,499
writable device right well you boot to a

586
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,479
live CD and then you just plug in a USB

587
00:26:02,499 --> 00:26:06,129
device and you mount that and that's how

588
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:10,479
you your exfiltrate data so that it's

589
00:26:06,129 --> 00:26:14,469
like okay well that's that's that's my

590
00:26:10,479 --> 00:26:18,309
doesn't you know it's funny as an

591
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:21,309
auditor you know i-i-i i look at access

592
00:26:18,309 --> 00:26:23,320
control records all the time until I'm

593
00:26:21,309 --> 00:26:25,690
blue in the face one of the things that

594
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:28,509
blows me away absolutely blows me away

595
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:32,139
is when I look at who has accounts on

596
00:26:28,509 --> 00:26:34,239
the network it's always more than you

597
00:26:32,139 --> 00:26:35,678
ever think that that would be there you

598
00:26:34,239 --> 00:26:39,249
know especially if they're not totally

599
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:40,989
on top of it and even then so so the who

600
00:26:39,249 --> 00:26:42,309
are the threats that that could could

601
00:26:40,989 --> 00:26:43,899
use these types of things well the

602
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:45,399
threats are the obvious ones I mean

603
00:26:43,899 --> 00:26:47,439
employees the disgruntled

604
00:26:45,399 --> 00:26:49,570
you know the insider threat that's the

605
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,149
obvious one but I think these other ones

606
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:54,279
are equally threats and you know the the

607
00:26:52,149 --> 00:26:57,309
vendors the contractors the consult

608
00:26:54,279 --> 00:27:00,099
consultants who often have elevated

609
00:26:57,309 --> 00:27:01,899
privileges and who often don't have any

610
00:27:00,099 --> 00:27:04,779
allegiance to to the people that they're

611
00:27:01,899 --> 00:27:06,580
serving and and and they have reasons to

612
00:27:04,779 --> 00:27:10,690
want to get you know data off the

613
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:13,779
network business partners visitors one

614
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:16,809
of the things is is organizations will

615
00:27:13,779 --> 00:27:19,599
give a visitor network privilege to get

616
00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:23,710
out to the Internet it's like are you

617
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:24,908
kidding me they and you know it's

618
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:26,830
ridiculous that they you know they don't

619
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:29,799
have a fully segregated you know Wi-Fi

620
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:32,168
network for that foreign visitors and

621
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:34,570
not to pick on that except I have I have

622
00:27:32,169 --> 00:27:36,700
personal experience knowing about

623
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:42,249
significant intellectual property that

624
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:44,859
was exfiltrated on by foreign visitors

625
00:27:42,249 --> 00:27:46,809
you know and then temps short term

626
00:27:44,859 --> 00:27:48,759
employees intern summer students I mean

627
00:27:46,809 --> 00:27:51,340
even people who you think oh geez these

628
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:53,859
people can't hurt us well those are the

629
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:55,870
people who probably are you know more

630
00:27:53,859 --> 00:27:58,029
sophisticated around this thing and

631
00:27:55,870 --> 00:28:00,100
a lot of the network matters and for

632
00:27:58,029 --> 00:28:03,360
crying out loud leaving auditors on your

633
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:09,939
network he should never do that so

634
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:13,449
alright closing comments I of these of

635
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:16,059
these dozen methods are half or more

636
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:19,900
will work on any site that I have been

637
00:28:16,059 --> 00:28:21,399
to in in the last couple of years the

638
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:25,059
organization's are very very unlikely to

639
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:27,159
detect the the exfiltration again in

640
00:28:25,059 --> 00:28:29,100
real-time a forensic examination would

641
00:28:27,159 --> 00:28:32,590
show it but I'm not talking about that

642
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:35,590
the awareness of these bypasses by by

643
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:39,520
the IT professionals the people who are

644
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:41,770
setting it up is is almost zero I'm sure

645
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:44,020
that other people are aware of these

646
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:46,210
right I mean some of the folks I saw

647
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:47,620
smiling when I talked about that one

648
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:52,450
it's probably your favorite one to

649
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:53,918
accelerate this yeah I I'm not the only

650
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:54,820
one who knows about this but by a

651
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:57,580
longshot

652
00:28:54,820 --> 00:29:00,970
the reason for the the reason for my

653
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:04,539
presentation here is is is very simple

654
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:08,140
without awareness of these bypasses the

655
00:29:04,539 --> 00:29:13,779
preventative controls are almost never

656
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:16,539
going to be installed so so that's it I

657
00:29:13,779 --> 00:29:19,570
would love to hear about your favorite

658
00:29:16,539 --> 00:29:23,559
bypass because I bet I bet you can take

659
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:27,389
my dozen and more than double it so any

660
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:27,389
thoughts questions sir

661
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:39,360
which had the best success for mediating

662
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:39,360
against those bypasses and why

663
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:52,170
so it really depends on the technical

664
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:54,450
management for the network and how

665
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:56,370
committed they are to remediate it I

666
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:58,800
mean I'm not trying to give you one of

667
00:29:56,370 --> 00:30:02,909
these BSC answers but one of the things

668
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:04,560
that one of the things that I know is it

669
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:10,320
depends upon how committed the

670
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:13,409
organization is to closing holes so the

671
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:16,470
simple answer is that when I come back

672
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:18,810
the next year usually seven or eight of

673
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:20,400
these controls are closed and then the

674
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:21,919
year after that the rest get closed

675
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:26,820
because I kind of hammer on them again

676
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:29,790
so but some of them as I say are more

677
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:31,290
difficult to to to close like they you

678
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:34,830
know this this thing with the with the

679
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:36,149
Android phone because it's you know if

680
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:37,260
you if you're using

681
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:40,200
I don't know Symantec endpoint

682
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:42,240
protection or GFI or whatever it's not

683
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,740
simply clicking the button saying shut

684
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,420
it off it doesn't you have to do

685
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:46,680
something more you had to push the

686
00:30:45,420 --> 00:31:01,830
policy so that becomes a little bit more

687
00:30:46,680 --> 00:31:03,960
complex yeah yeah we we've been through

688
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:06,389
it enough so that if they can't figure

689
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:08,130
it out on the by themselves they'll give

690
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:09,960
us a call and you know we can we can

691
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:13,110
point them in the right directions or or

692
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:15,270
connect them with other folks that we

693
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:18,479
know would be willing to you know serve

694
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:19,950
the community and help them so yeah yeah

695
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,140
I mean the worst thing an auditor can do

696
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:24,600
is dump a report on something on

697
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:27,720
somebody that they you know convicts

698
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:30,120
yeah yeah no we've been around this so

699
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:32,070
many times that that we kind of know

700
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:34,469
what has to be done I mean we know where

701
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:39,320
to look so yeah

702
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:39,320
oh I'm good sorry

703
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:58,280
well I I actually wanted to take out

704
00:31:55,730 --> 00:32:01,039
remote-access he's sort of out of my my

705
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:06,580
talk because I think of you know the

706
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:08,750
ability to do acceleration using using

707
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:11,090
facilities that have been provided or

708
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:16,970
you know that that's kind of a talk for

709
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:18,289
maybe next year but so I think I think

710
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:19,880
there's a lot of opportunities for

711
00:32:18,289 --> 00:32:23,179
people to do when you never remote

712
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:25,370
remote type stuff yeah I was just trying

713
00:32:23,179 --> 00:32:28,669
to really really think about the

714
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:31,639
absolute simplest ones you know there

715
00:32:28,669 --> 00:32:33,350
are more I mean people want if people

716
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:35,000
wanted to certainly if technical people

717
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:37,789
wanted to get data out I mean that

718
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,770
that's that's that that's possible I was

719
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:44,270
just trying to think of you know the

720
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:47,450
simple people simple people I didn't

721
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:50,240
mean that they're simple I didn't I'm

722
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:53,950
sorry someone back here had had their

723
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,950
hand up sir

724
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:09,180
I will not I mean obviously what I'll do

725
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:10,620
is I'll create you know a text file or

726
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:13,740
something like that I'm not going to

727
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:17,010
actually take my clients data and

728
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:19,560
exfiltrate it I am I'm kind of crazy

729
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:21,560
even I'm not that crazy so I will take

730
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:24,210
data that I put on their network and

731
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:25,740
because I can because yeah because I can

732
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:28,080
I can get it on their network as easy as

733
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:30,060
I can get it off to be honest so I'll

734
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:33,870
take something that will demonstrate

735
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:35,909
that I can you know get a good chunk of

736
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:42,149
data out why didn't what're you asking

737
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:43,920
curious because what oh oh yeah yeah

738
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:46,650
yeah right right and certainly not the

739
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:49,290
way I'm using it and and if you're yeah

740
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:51,410
right right oh you have sorry you're

741
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:51,409
right

742
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:05,040
excellent question as one of the

743
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,500
wonderful things about being an auditor

744
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:09,779
is you can be a real jerk so you can go

745
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:13,109
in and say this is what I want from you

746
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:17,760
because because I'm I'm being paid by by

747
00:34:13,109 --> 00:34:20,690
the board okay so I can so I get to pick

748
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:24,869
I get to pick the workstation I want and

749
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:28,550
I always use user credentials so I never

750
00:34:24,869 --> 00:34:31,379
make the mistake of taking a taking

751
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:32,700
facilities that IT gives me because

752
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:36,690
they're always going to be different

753
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:39,509
than the actual production and I never

754
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:42,060
use any credentials of someone other

755
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:46,109
than someone who I have selected so what

756
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:48,659
I'll do is I'll you know as an auditor I

757
00:34:46,109 --> 00:34:50,940
mean you wouldn't believe how lucky I am

758
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:53,399
I can I can always kind of pick the

759
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:55,760
right ones to look for you know it's

760
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:57,630
always you know it's always Sally in

761
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:01,170
auditing that has the elevated

762
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:04,560
credentials or I mean I'm good at that

763
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:06,660
so yeah but I I get to choose that I

764
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:10,440
would never do it with my own I don't I

765
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:12,540
I don't usually even connect connect my

766
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:15,320
stuff up to their network I don't want

767
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:15,320
them to hose me

768
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:28,390
some of her techniques

769
00:35:25,049 --> 00:35:30,400
yeah you know it's funny it's funny you

770
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:32,920
say that because I would have expected a

771
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:36,309
lot more whitelisting I I don't see much

772
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:38,109
whitelisting I I just don't see it I

773
00:35:36,309 --> 00:35:45,040
hear a lot of people talking about about

774
00:35:38,109 --> 00:35:50,799
it I think it's just a different method

775
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:54,400
because the the applications that they

776
00:35:50,799 --> 00:35:56,319
would whitelist are not going to be

777
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,869
problematic for me to use the drivers

778
00:35:56,319 --> 00:36:02,230
that I want so because the drivers would

779
00:35:58,869 --> 00:36:03,760
already be would already be installed so

780
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:23,970
I don't I don't think that would be a

781
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:26,740
problem yeah that's a good question I

782
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:28,209
mean some endpoint protection systems

783
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:33,549
are a little bit better than others for

784
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:37,299
example I mean a little bit but I always

785
00:36:33,549 --> 00:36:38,950
get through and just always do it and

786
00:36:37,299 --> 00:36:41,109
and that's again that's the reason for

787
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:43,720
the for the paper it's because I I can I

788
00:36:41,109 --> 00:36:45,880
mean I'll get a dozen you know when you

789
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:52,118
have that many tools one of the tools is

790
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:53,710
going to work so yeah I I wouldn't say

791
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:56,380
that there's any one particular thing

792
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:57,549
that says geez if they have that you

793
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:59,650
know it's gonna be it's become

794
00:36:57,549 --> 00:37:00,670
problematic you know it's not like I can

795
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:02,799
say you know Symantec endpoint

796
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:04,480
protection with with the network aware

797
00:37:02,799 --> 00:37:06,099
of stuff that they have it's going to

798
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,569
cause me problems cause any problems

799
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:13,349
when they scan but that's a it's a

800
00:37:07,569 --> 00:37:13,349
different problem so I can't say

801
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:21,620
so I wish I could see what you know

802
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,570
really sophisticated networks are you

803
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:25,640
know I'd love to you know if anyone

804
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:28,280
wanted to volunteer their network that

805
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:30,560
you know where they work at you know

806
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:32,240
fidelity or you know one of the you know

807
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,950
Bank of America or you know you know

808
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,689
someone who's who's who's of really I'd

809
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:40,939
love to take the challenge on I'd do it

810
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:42,770
for free actually but so well thank you

811
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:44,570
thank you and anything if you do want to

812
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:46,580
