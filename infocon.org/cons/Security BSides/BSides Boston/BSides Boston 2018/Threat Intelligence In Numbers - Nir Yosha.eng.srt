1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:07,710
yeah I like you so good morning everyone

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,719
my name is Mitch taki I'm on the

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,969
Planning Committee for b-sides Boston

4
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:13,940
Hope thanks me so I'm just here to

5
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:16,619
introduce near he's going to talk about

6
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:19,980
statistics threat intelligence threat

7
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:22,380
hunting he's from threat coach motion so

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,810
he's near he's also at the end of the

9
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,689
talk these lovely laser me toss them out

10
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:29,070
t-shirts and stuff and stickers so be on

11
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:36,000
the lookout all right thank you guys

12
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:41,879
thank you hi everyone how is everyone

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,910
doing as well so I took this photo you

14
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:45,419
see up here while on vacation in the

15
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,360
Caribbean

16
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:51,000
specifically in Sint Maarten and I

17
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:54,329
remember taking that photo because at

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,180
the same day I received the email from

19
00:00:54,329 --> 00:01:00,829
b-side informing me that my talk was

20
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:03,359
accepted so I remember taking the photo

21
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:07,080
sitting in a balcony watching this

22
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:12,000
beautiful sunset feeling the Caribbean

23
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:16,439
breathe and thinking about what might be

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,939
sliced off right so here's what we've

25
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:22,860
got to talk about today the first thing

26
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:25,589
I want to suggest is that threat

27
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:28,890
intelligence datasets are growing and

28
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:31,110
continue to grow I will use some

29
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:34,439
statistics and some numbers in order to

30
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:37,470
prove my point and then since we are

31
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:40,380
dealing with big data sets I'll suggest

32
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:42,500
data mining techniques first

33
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,610
classification then scoring

34
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:47,250
then I'll speak a little bit about

35
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:49,159
threat intelligence investigation and

36
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,360
I'll end up with threat intelligence

37
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:54,000
effectiveness if you guys have any

38
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:58,219
questions at all you can raise your hand

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,630
or we can have some Q&A time at the end

40
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:02,820
so a little bit about myself you

41
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:06,750
probably guessed I'm not originally from

42
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:09,258
the US I was born in Israel I served in

43
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:12,330
the Israeli intelligence courts

44
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:13,739
specifically working with signal

45
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:17,700
processing and

46
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:21,090
intelligence I graduated as a computer

47
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,630
engineer and I moved to the u.s. 15

48
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,570
years ago

49
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:27,180
working for multiple vendors

50
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:29,160
specifically in the network security in

51
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:33,000
user behavior analytics and obviously

52
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:36,329
insert intelligence so what is

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,180
threatening diligence in my mind so as a

54
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:41,220
threat intelligence engineer I read a

55
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,470
lot of reports coming in after every

56
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:46,970
incident and I like all the reports

57
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:49,290
whether is the pandas or the Bears the

58
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:52,770
infrastructures or the Internet of

59
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:57,150
Things the Middle East or the America

60
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:59,280
it's all very interesting however not

61
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:02,970
everything that is interesting to me

62
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,460
necessarily relevant to my customers on

63
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:07,590
the other hand the customers thinks on

64
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:10,260
imminent threats and risks does not

65
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:13,290
necessarily match the actual threats

66
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:16,320
landscapes so threat intelligence to me

67
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:18,179
is all about this middle ground it's all

68
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,950
about the overlap between the

69
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:23,070
organization goals the organization

70
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:24,899
organization needs from one side and

71
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:28,049
threat intelligence landscape from the

72
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:31,260
other what impact your critical asset

73
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:35,940
right what impact your vulnerabilities

74
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:38,730
and your reputation and since this is

75
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:41,750
what threat intelligence cycle looks

76
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:45,269
like in my mind it all begins with

77
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:46,680
objectives we need to understand what

78
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:49,290
are the requirements of the

79
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:52,440
organization's are we looking at

80
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:54,929
tactics strategic or operational threat

81
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:57,480
intelligence do we want to work with the

82
00:03:54,930 --> 00:04:01,110
cyber kill chain model or do we want to

83
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,880
work with the diamond model once instead

84
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:04,230
of the requirements we look at

85
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,299
collecting threat intelligent

86
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:09,359
information and threat intelligence

87
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:12,080
comes from both internal and external

88
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,080
sources

89
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,570
the one second

90
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:36,670
okay so collection involves indicators

91
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:40,930
of compromise now those could be coming

92
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:44,170
in from inside or from outside and those

93
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:47,950
indicators eventually will be due to

94
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:50,290
placated aggregated normalized the next

95
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:53,349
step is taking the information into

96
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:55,450
processing what is processing processing

97
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:57,720
is the face where you are actually

98
00:04:55,450 --> 00:05:00,880
trying to make sense out of the data

99
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:04,380
right and so this is the one I'm going

100
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,880
to focus on mostly today and eventually

101
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:10,150
dissemination threat intelligence should

102
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,370
be actionable we want to be able to send

103
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:14,260
alert into the IR team to send

104
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:16,930
information to the security operation

105
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:25,560
center send reports to management and so

106
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:28,420
on so getting back to my first point

107
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:32,170
wise rated data sets will continue to

108
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:34,360
grow starting at this chart it shows you

109
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:36,970
the predicting number of connected

110
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:42,900
devices and people to the internet by

111
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:45,610
2020 now we currently around 28 here

112
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:47,020
billion devices already connected to the

113
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:49,930
internet thanks to the Internet of

114
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:54,460
Things and this is going to grow up to

115
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:57,670
50 billion devices by 2020 I suppose

116
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:59,710
people we have around two billion people

117
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:02,530
connected today and that number is going

118
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:05,799
to grow as well to around six billion by

119
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:09,070
2020 now what if that means that means

120
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:11,170
that both the network attack surfaces

121
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:13,360
and the human attack surfaces will

122
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:16,210
continue to grow that means that they're

123
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,760
going to be more surfaces for adversary

124
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:21,989
to launch their attacks more social

125
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:26,050
engineering more spearfishing and so on

126
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:29,590
on top of that there is a cyber security

127
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:32,260
hiring crisis we already there they are

128
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:35,890
missing people from this cyber security

129
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:38,980
workplace and it is expected to get into

130
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:41,360
one and a half million people missing

131
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:43,370
from the security workplace by

132
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,620
20:19 what that means is that they're

133
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:48,680
going to be less defenders going to be

134
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:52,069
less people watching our networks and

135
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:54,849
less threat intelligence engineers and

136
00:06:52,069 --> 00:07:00,110
so as a result we will continue to have

137
00:06:54,849 --> 00:07:05,300
incidents coming in all the time here's

138
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:07,520
an incident and when we're getting we're

139
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,110
getting those incidents the companies

140
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,870
will serve information there's going to

141
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:14,419
be more and more data sets or threating

142
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:17,870
to information and therefore data sets

143
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:19,729
will continue to grow now getting back

144
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:22,029
into my vacation how do you think the

145
00:07:19,729 --> 00:07:26,150
weather was in st. Maarten

146
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:28,189
so me and my wife took the average of

147
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:30,830
the temperature calculated they standard

148
00:07:28,189 --> 00:07:33,379
deviation and decided that 95% is going

149
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:33,949
to be a good weather right no we're not

150
00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:35,990
that crazy

151
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:39,979
we know weather in st. Maarten will be

152
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:42,590
always nice right however the physics is

153
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:46,008
neither useful weather prediction and

154
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:50,469
can be used in threat intelligence so

155
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:53,500
this is an example of a chart done by

156
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:57,139
palapa theory from the hack mageddon

157
00:07:53,500 --> 00:08:00,020
website and it looks for the past three

158
00:07:57,139 --> 00:08:03,949
years of reported incidents and the

159
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:05,870
average is that we get 82 reported per

160
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:07,430
month this is only the reported

161
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:10,250
incidence will probably get much more

162
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:12,650
and then the standard variation 13 which

163
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:16,129
means that more or less we can use this

164
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:19,520
number as an average and so let's try to

165
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:23,060
find how many attacks are currently in

166
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:25,818
progress the concurrent attacks in order

167
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:28,759
to find this I need to take a dwell time

168
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:31,189
the blow time is the time from the first

169
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:32,899
intrusion until victims is actually

170
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:35,390
detecting the attack right

171
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:39,820
and so this explores us that it is four

172
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:43,899
months so I'm taking four months / 82

173
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:47,870
incident per month there are 328

174
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:50,930
transparent attacks 328 companies under

175
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:54,050
attack at this moment and that's the

176
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:55,120
bare minimum now we were behind those

177
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:58,130
attacks

178
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:02,380
well security companies identified

179
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:05,270
around 50 adversary groups there are

180
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:08,570
thousands of hackers and there are even

181
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:10,850
more script kiddies but big huge

182
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:14,210
adversary groups that can create damage

183
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:16,250
that over 2 million records stolen there

184
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:18,680
are somewhere around 50 and you can see

185
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:24,440
some of them here there are anywhere

186
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:26,050
between nation-state cyber crime which

187
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:30,860
is the ones we're going to focus on

188
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:33,290
hacktivist and cyber terrorists so let's

189
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:37,570
look at the cybercrime one again I'm

190
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:41,060
just playing with numbers here and I

191
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:44,240
think that based on the 60 percent of

192
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:46,750
hackers working in cybercrime the 30 is

193
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,430
an average number for this high-level

194
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:51,650
sophisticated hackers that can create a

195
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:54,469
damage of 2 million records stolen stand

196
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:58,970
up now again looking at the statistics

197
00:09:54,470 --> 00:10:01,070
we have around 35 incidence careers that

198
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:03,620
match the size and so what I can

199
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:04,130
calculate here is how many successful

200
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:09,110
attacks

201
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:11,810
I have pair adversary that make sense

202
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:14,570
that basically tells me that each one of

203
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:18,290
those 30 adversaries is having at least

204
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:19,970
one successful attack period now it's be

205
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:24,050
taking those records and selling them in

206
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:26,780
the black market in the dark web they

207
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:30,469
will get at least $10 per record so

208
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:35,600
bring an adversary one of those 30 plays

209
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:38,810
off now after each and every of those

210
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:41,810
incidents we have an incident reports an

211
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:44,449
incident reports describes what has been

212
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:47,030
done during the hack try to get what

213
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:50,690
kind of evidence Clues similarly to

214
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:53,470
those forensic evidence from a chronic

215
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:56,720
crime scene and those are called

216
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:58,340
indicators of compromise which the

217
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,210
mirror with in the case of compromised

218
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:05,120
the resin hand great so as you know just

219
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:07,400
this could be IP addresses domain names

220
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,100
URL and so on

221
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:12,020
those will indicate a probable intrusion

222
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:14,300
in your network so you want to get that

223
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:17,660
list and we're going to give it to you

224
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:20,930
there are many many many threat

225
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:24,110
intelligence providers out there from

226
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:27,829
open source to commercials to private

227
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:32,480
community all those create what I call a

228
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:34,790
virtual threat library that's kind of

229
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,650
answering most of the questions you have

230
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:38,449
regarding threat intelligence and you

231
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:41,120
can go just like in the library to each

232
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:44,690
one of them and try to get the relevant

233
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:47,390
answer to your question now threat

234
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:50,870
intelligence platforms can help you in

235
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:52,970
here since there are so many providers

236
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:55,670
you probably wants to cross correlate

237
00:11:52,970 --> 00:12:00,170
between all of them and look at them

238
00:11:55,670 --> 00:12:03,709
under one single pane of glass and so as

239
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:06,500
a threat intelligence platform company

240
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:10,150
we have visibility to all of those

241
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:13,280
indicators and we see that an average

242
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:16,370
indicators we get from each source is

243
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:21,050
anywhere between three hundred and ten

244
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:23,750
thousand indicators per day if you do

245
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:28,130
the calculation how many indicators you

246
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:32,330
get pair ear just the bare minimum I'm

247
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:35,930
taking 300 a day and let's say I'm

248
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:41,150
subscribed to four sources I get almost

249
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:42,739
half a million indicators pair ear now

250
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:44,840
from a security operations perspective

251
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:46,720
this is not practical it's not

252
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:49,280
manageable you cannot push

253
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:53,260
half-a-million indicators to the sensor

254
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:55,939
grid such as the firewalls or ideas and

255
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:58,130
from security threat intelligence

256
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:00,260
perspective it is not practical as well

257
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:02,990
because there's no way you get enough

258
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:06,770
time to investigate so many indicators

259
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:12,230
so we have to do something and my first

260
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:13,640
advice is using classification so we

261
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:19,040
cannot talk about application without

262
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:21,250
food right so let's see which what we

263
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,250
had

264
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:27,060
so this was in st. Maarten I took this

265
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:29,779
photo and if I ask you which restaurant

266
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:35,569
this came out out of is that a French

267
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:38,459
Dutch Caribbean it's really hard right

268
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:42,089
what if I tell you that st. Maarten has

269
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:45,660
half batch and half French side so I'm

270
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:48,630
going to help maybe but still

271
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:51,180
classification could be a very hard task

272
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:53,700
because classification is the process

273
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:55,469
where you create categories and you

274
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:59,070
decide which categories you need to put

275
00:13:55,470 --> 00:14:01,260
each and every item grouping is the next

276
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:03,510
step while we decide which classes you

277
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:05,519
work grouping is taking those items and

278
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:08,459
just assigning them to the right

279
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:11,519
category but classification is very hard

280
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:15,329
and it is hard with retic diligence as

281
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:17,370
well and so the different classification

282
00:14:15,329 --> 00:14:20,430
with threat intelligence feeds by the

283
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:22,829
vendors are by eye by type by indicator

284
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:26,279
path right we have IP addresses domain

285
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:30,120
names URL etcetera when I suggest that

286
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:33,480
classification using attributes which

287
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:36,839
are the context behind those indicators

288
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:40,020
can help you reduce the noise as an

289
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:43,140
example we can look at a malware family

290
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:46,680
if we create grouping by malware family

291
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:49,980
we can create grouping by the kill chain

292
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:51,959
process so identify each indicator which

293
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:54,390
phase within the kitchen they're related

294
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:56,969
to we can identify space where

295
00:14:54,390 --> 00:15:01,260
geographical location languages and so

296
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:02,790
on another way to classify is looking at

297
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:05,430
target attacks and looking at

298
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:07,380
adversaries that are after finance or

299
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:10,079
after health care after infrastructure

300
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:13,430
and then identify our industry and look

301
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,430
at those that are relevant to ask

302
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:18,630
incidents or events those are indicators

303
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:20,579
that all came from the same event or the

304
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:23,430
same incident so regardless of the type

305
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:24,930
there kind of part of the same kill

306
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:26,910
chain and I want to put them together

307
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:29,279
and see if there's any correlations I

308
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:32,939
can understand what really was the

309
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:36,870
process of events okay

310
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:39,240
and finally to my first point if you can

311
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:42,030
find out relevant indicators to your

312
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:44,910
organization that would be the best if

313
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:47,930
you can sort your indicators pair the

314
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:50,459
specific devices you using the specific

315
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:53,790
vulnerabilities that relevant to your

316
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:59,580
company that's probably the best that

317
00:15:53,790 --> 00:16:03,660
make sense great so the third question

318
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:07,620
research team was conducting a small

319
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:10,500
test around the attributes what we did

320
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:13,860
here is we took four different sources

321
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:16,730
and for each one of the sources we

322
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:19,410
measure the number of attributes that

323
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:21,060
describe the different indicators now

324
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:23,490
it's a little bit hard to see it here

325
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:25,229
but on the left-hand side those are the

326
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:27,690
different sources and you can see some

327
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:30,900
of them give 12 attributes one of them

328
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:33,570
is giving three on the right hand side

329
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:35,160
we trying to cross correlate we're

330
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:38,850
trying to see what is the overlap

331
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:41,160
between the Bender's and unfortunately

332
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:43,380
there is a very little overlap which

333
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:46,560
means that most of the vendors have

334
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:48,689
vendor specific terminologies and ways

335
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,819
to describe the threat intelligence and

336
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:57,780
that's a challenge because it makes it

337
00:16:50,820 --> 00:17:01,020
hard for us to normalize the data and so

338
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:03,449
there are some community driven efforts

339
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:06,420
in the market in order to standardize

340
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:09,870
threat intelligence communication open

341
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:13,860
IOC and stick taxi are the some of them

342
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:17,219
and what they're trying to do is they're

343
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:19,020
trying to create terms that will be able

344
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:22,170
to be exchanged between an organization

345
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:26,939
and other having it vendor specific it's

346
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:30,510
going to be a standard however none of

347
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:32,070
them is really adapted 100% yet and even

348
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:34,500
if it's going to be adapted

349
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:36,720
I suggest that they're still going to be

350
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:42,810
noised needs to be cleaned out on

351
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:44,970
indicators so here's one example of a

352
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:46,649
very noisy indicator so this is what our

353
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:48,690
research group was looking

354
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:52,620
and they found that hash values are

355
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:54,900
relatively much more noisy than registry

356
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:56,909
key for example you can see that there

357
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:59,370
are many more indicators in average now

358
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:02,430
this could be a result of having a lot

359
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:04,770
of command and control information and a

360
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:06,450
lot of malware is coming down and hash

361
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:09,120
has been created and as you know

362
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:12,750
adversaries figured out a long time ago

363
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,429
that the defenders using hash values to

364
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:18,480
detect and so what they do is they keep

365
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:21,750
on creating those mutations right a way

366
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:24,380
to go around it is to create a sectional

367
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:26,730
hashing what is the sectional rashing

368
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:28,830
sectional trashing is when you look into

369
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:31,830
the malware and try to create hashes of

370
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:34,020
the specific functions within it and so

371
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:36,240
if the adversary will change a portion

372
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:38,520
of a malware still there's a chance that

373
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:43,080
this time other hashes will match those

374
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:45,510
i/o sees another way is fuzzy hashing so

375
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,100
I like regular hashing which changed

376
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:49,560
totally different the hash value

377
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:53,310
whenever there's a small change fuzzy

378
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:56,310
hashing is showing the similarities

379
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:58,260
between two files so it's two files have

380
00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:00,450
a little different between them the

381
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:07,440
fuzzy hash will have a different little

382
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:10,050
as well another relatively noisy

383
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,820
indicators we found is the indicators

384
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:15,870
associated with the command and control

385
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:18,120
so looking at the kill chain steps the

386
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:20,540
attorney sends the library relatively

387
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:23,310
has a manageable number of indicators

388
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:28,020
the command and control is very noisy

389
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:30,690
for many reasons first they are a lot of

390
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:34,220
botnets out there that communicating to

391
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:38,720
different servers but there are also

392
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:42,750
adversary created techniques such as the

393
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:45,060
domain generation algorithm which had

394
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:48,750
the malware trying to communicate with

395
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:50,879
thousands of fake domains and so

396
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:52,110
sandboxes will create thousands of

397
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,570
indicators around it

398
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:57,479
however none of those domains could be

399
00:19:54,570 --> 00:20:00,439
registered and so my suggestion is try

400
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,480
to subgroup the indicators related to

401
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:05,060
command-and-control see which one are a

402
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,010
generation based on the domain

403
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:10,129
generation algorithm and which one are a

404
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:13,640
result of an existing valid register

405
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:15,650
domain by the way they are already

406
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,060
machine learning techniques that are

407
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:19,760
trying to figure out whether it's a

408
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:21,800
valid domain by analyzing the name and

409
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,240
see if it makes any sense in English if

410
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:26,240
it doesn't make any sense in English

411
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:28,580
it's just gibberish high chance that if

412
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:35,510
the results of domain generating

413
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:37,220
algorithm so we spoke about

414
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:39,770
classification let's speak a little bit

415
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:44,090
about racing but we have to get back to

416
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:45,620
a vacation so before coming to the

417
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:49,220
education we have to pick up the resort

418
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:50,659
and like most of you probably do by the

419
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:52,160
way if you want to know which resort we

420
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:56,210
went to you can come after around let

421
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:59,120
you know the way we did it is probably

422
00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:01,760
like everyone does which is looking at

423
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,979
waiting reading reviews trying to score

424
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:07,640
and then decide which one of those we

425
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:10,850
should go with right we can do the same

426
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:14,080
thing with threat intelligence speeds so

427
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:17,389
this is the project done by Alex Pinto

428
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:19,520
he was creating the analytic open source

429
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:22,160
project and he had some interesting

430
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,590
tests here he calls the novel peak test

431
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:27,440
and what does this test is trying to see

432
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:29,149
is how many indicators are added with

433
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,780
the time and how many indicators are

434
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:35,510
removed within time over different types

435
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:38,180
of threat intelligence sources so this

436
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:40,610
one is interesting you can see here that

437
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:43,250
there are indicators added within time

438
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:47,389
but there is almost no indicators

439
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:49,810
removed over time right which means that

440
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:52,340
this list is going to continue grow and

441
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:55,370
it's also a challenge because we know

442
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:57,770
indicators have a lifespan like I said

443
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:59,810
earlier sorry keep on changing them and

444
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:01,340
so if we're not going to expire the

445
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:03,169
indicator or remove them from the list

446
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:08,540
we're going to end up with the noise at

447
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:10,730
some point this is another pattern here

448
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:13,049
you can see a spike of removed

449
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:15,720
indicators and a little bit added again

450
00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:19,049
some quiet time then another spike quiet

451
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:21,539
time and another spike and that could be

452
00:22:19,049 --> 00:22:24,090
a challenge as well because

453
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:27,779
theoretically threat intelligence stream

454
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:30,570
should be steady should be continuous it

455
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:31,769
could be some new malware that is being

456
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:34,230
released out there that will create a

457
00:22:31,769 --> 00:22:35,759
spike but for the long run it couldn't

458
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:38,580
have this pattern this might suggest

459
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:40,590
that the source is collecting all the

460
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:41,879
information and not sending it to you in

461
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:43,499
a timely manner

462
00:22:41,879 --> 00:22:47,908
which means that you might get your

463
00:22:43,499 --> 00:22:50,970
indicators too late and another example

464
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:53,580
of a pattern where this is an extreme

465
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:55,139
situation where the source is adding and

466
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:59,129
removing the same amount of indicator

467
00:22:55,139 --> 00:23:03,238
every day very novel very very up to

468
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:05,879
speed so that's one way to look at the

469
00:23:03,239 --> 00:23:10,350
indicators now we can use the pyramid of

470
00:23:05,879 --> 00:23:15,840
pain to understand which indicators we

471
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:18,649
need to expire or retire first so the

472
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:22,019
pyramid of pain created by David Bianco

473
00:23:18,649 --> 00:23:23,789
suggests that on the lower part of the

474
00:23:22,019 --> 00:23:25,799
pyramid has values

475
00:23:23,789 --> 00:23:27,720
IP addresses and domain names are

476
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:30,418
relatively needs need to change by the

477
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:33,869
adversary and therefore they're going to

478
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:37,340
be having a short life cycle on the

479
00:23:33,869 --> 00:23:39,600
other hand be truth like the malware's

480
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:42,449
infrastructures and tactics techniques

481
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:45,629
and procedures who are more behavioral

482
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:48,299
indicators those are harder to change by

483
00:23:45,629 --> 00:23:51,809
the adversary and therefore those are

484
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:55,918
going to be relevant for longer so

485
00:23:51,809 --> 00:23:58,590
that's one way to look at it this is

486
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:02,399
another interesting test which called

487
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:05,039
the overlap test and here what we try to

488
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:08,488
do is we try to compare multiple sources

489
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:10,109
to the other sources and we compare the

490
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:14,100
source to themself in the middle here

491
00:24:10,109 --> 00:24:16,439
and 100% overlap is obvious because when

492
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:20,820
we compare the source to itself is 100%

493
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:23,249
right but look at the indicators coming

494
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:25,980
in from multiple sources compared with

495
00:24:23,249 --> 00:24:26,520
other sources you see all the white

496
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:30,090
Shari

497
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:34,740
here represent zero or close to zero

498
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:37,530
overlap between the Bender's which means

499
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:40,350
that the multiple threat intelligence

500
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:42,660
sources they all come to us they are all

501
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:44,730
telling us we have the best threat

502
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:47,510
intelligence that you have or you should

503
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:51,180
have and none of them has an overlap

504
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:53,550
which brings up the question which one

505
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:56,420
should I go with right they're all

506
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:56,419
telling that they're good

507
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:03,470
it says that were scoring gets into play

508
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:06,210
that's what scoring can help us identify

509
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:09,020
eventually which sources are relevant to

510
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:11,640
us and there's no right and wrong here

511
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:13,410
all those sources might be relevant to

512
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,700
specific companies you just want to find

513
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:19,920
those that are relevant to your

514
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:21,600
organization and so what are the scoring

515
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,760
key materials

516
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,530
well indicator parts we spoke about it

517
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:28,350
there are indicators that have a little

518
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:30,149
bit lower life cycle but also your

519
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:32,070
organization life might be more driven

520
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:36,020
towards host-based indicators rather

521
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:39,300
than network based indicators sources

522
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:41,760
generally speaking or intuitively you

523
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:44,460
might want to score commercial sources

524
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,530
higher than open sources because you pay

525
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:48,480
them right and then maybe

526
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:49,889
community-driven that are specific to

527
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:54,000
one sector or even higher than

528
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:55,710
commercial another score can be pair

529
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,510
attributes so like I mentioned earlier

530
00:25:55,710 --> 00:26:00,690
all the indicators coming in with

531
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:02,700
attributes and so at some point you will

532
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:05,520
get a feeling on those attributes that's

533
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:07,260
really contributory investigation versus

534
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:10,560
those that are not and you can have an

535
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:12,720
indicator with twenty attributes that's

536
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,490
not helping you at all or an indicator

537
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,350
with two attributes that are the ones

538
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:19,020
you really need

539
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:20,699
and finally adversary similarly to what

540
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:26,310
I mentioned earlier you want to score

541
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:28,080
based adversaries and pairs target so

542
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:29,909
marvelous is interesting with every one

543
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,530
of sort indicators pair modelers but

544
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:35,100
what do we do with that this is an

545
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:39,060
example of the mowers and the number of

546
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:40,659
indicators associated with them and the

547
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:43,659
first thing I want to note is that

548
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:45,940
the number of indicators associated with

549
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:48,370
the map a malware doesn't say anything

550
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:52,000
about the popularity of this malware

551
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:54,040
doesn't mean anything for example we

552
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,740
know lucky was malware number one for

553
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:58,629
ransomware during 2016 you can see here

554
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:02,860
we don't get so many indicators around

555
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:05,020
it but j.strother is just noise the type

556
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:08,620
of dropper and it creates a lot of

557
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:10,240
indicators around it so the way to score

558
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:12,219
is definitely not based on how many

559
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,530
indicators you have around the malware

560
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:18,520
but rather what is the distribution

561
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:20,620
mechanism is it a weaponize document

562
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:24,340
that this malware going to target you or

563
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:28,810
maybe the vector is exploited is that

564
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:31,840
malware piece responsible for actually

565
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:34,750
installing dropping what is the process

566
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:36,490
within this whole malware installation

567
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:43,840
that you're looking for those are the

568
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:46,750
criteria that relevant for you and those

569
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:50,020
are just three additional ideas that I

570
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:52,810
believe we can have a whole new talk for

571
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:55,300
each one of them on what scoring could

572
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:57,879
be based upon so I personally believe

573
00:27:55,300 --> 00:28:00,159
that correlation with your internal

574
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:03,370
tools like the theme or the user

575
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:08,230
behavior analytics is a great criteria

576
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:11,080
for high scores why because if you have

577
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:12,970
a specific indicators that found within

578
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:14,500
your theme and the same time there's an

579
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:17,230
external source telling you that this

580
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:18,970
indicator is bad either it's the post

581
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:21,310
positive and then you can take it out of

582
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:24,040
the way or it's something really bad

583
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:26,250
happening in your network right you

584
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:30,070
definitely want to know about that

585
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:33,880
signal-to-noise with time you get a

586
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:35,820
feeling on which indicators are more

587
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:38,650
noisy like I mentioned earlier earlier

588
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:41,710
using signal to noise will help you

589
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:45,280
reduce the amount of work of your threat

590
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:46,750
intelligence thing and confidence one of

591
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,610
the things you have with everything to

592
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:52,060
do with threat intelligence is confident

593
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:53,949
how much you trust this sort how much

594
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:55,960
you trust is indicator

595
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:58,360
being scored by one source or being

596
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:01,899
scored by four sources is the margin of

597
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:03,309
error ten percent or 40 percent you want

598
00:29:01,899 --> 00:29:05,860
to go with the one of course with a

599
00:29:03,309 --> 00:29:12,399
higher confidence and the lower margin

600
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:15,969
of error so we establish the scoring can

601
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:18,549
help you now question when I say

602
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:20,039
umbrella what's the first thing that

603
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:26,980
comes into your mind

604
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:27,820
rain anyone else Cisco umbrella drink

605
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:29,950
with umbrella

606
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:32,370
very good now that you referred to the

607
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:34,990
umbrella you're going to see now that

608
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:38,649
the umbrella I think of when I'm on

609
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:41,500
vacation in the Caribbean on a beach so

610
00:29:38,649 --> 00:29:46,000
the point is context is very important

611
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:47,830
right and similarly with indicators you

612
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,889
want to have context if you have an IP

613
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:52,840
address and the IP address is related to

614
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:54,129
spearfishing it's totally different than

615
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,559
an IP address related to a

616
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:59,740
command-and-control right and so context

617
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:01,720
is very important unfortunately we're

618
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:03,760
not always clear in the context there's

619
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:07,029
many reason for that but there are known

620
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:10,299
unknowns and we should be aware of the

621
00:30:07,029 --> 00:30:13,630
known unknowns why we don't know

622
00:30:10,299 --> 00:30:17,679
everything about all the incidents well

623
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:19,179
to begin with organisations not sharing

624
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:22,149
all the information they have about

625
00:30:19,179 --> 00:30:24,399
their incidence right mainly information

626
00:30:22,149 --> 00:30:25,719
that undermined their reputation of

627
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:27,729
vulnerability they will not share

628
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:31,600
everything with you they will share what

629
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:34,690
they feel comfortable with the other

630
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:37,449
things are steps within the kill chain

631
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:39,220
that you know should be there and you're

632
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:41,139
missing the information so an example

633
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:43,630
for spearfishing I know there was an

634
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:45,219
email address I just don't I know that

635
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:46,870
there was a file and I know that there

636
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:49,450
was a subject I just don't know what the

637
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:51,760
email subject was and so I have an idea

638
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:56,460
what I need to look for since I

639
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:59,350
understand the the process of the attack

640
00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:02,740
and statistics tells us there are

641
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:05,469
somewhere around 40 percents unknown

642
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:06,940
techniques used out there whether it's a

643
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:09,460
zero day

644
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:12,520
the tax you don't see out in the world

645
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:15,130
because they are targeting only you or

646
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:17,200
just you technique the attackers are

647
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:22,630
development the same way we developed

648
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:27,460
our new defense mechanisms and so in

649
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:30,580
order in order to answer those sorry you

650
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:34,510
know in order to answer those questions

651
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:36,790
we use enrichment tools and the way I

652
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:38,410
see enrichment tools is like this

653
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:40,840
lifeline in Who Wants to Be a

654
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:43,410
Millionaire television show we have

655
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:46,750
different ways to feel at the gap right

656
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:48,490
you can have the audience question for

657
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:51,310
the audience which is kind of

658
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:54,220
crowdsourcing so an example of the

659
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:56,649
audience is virustotal anyone familiar

660
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:58,690
with my throat oh yeah so what you do

661
00:31:56,650 --> 00:32:00,310
you upload the malware then you ask

662
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:02,200
multiple scanners what they think about

663
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:05,830
it and you get your answer then you can

664
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:07,180
decide what you do with it the friend or

665
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:09,100
the telephone friend I think they call

666
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:12,160
it that's when you have a specific

667
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:13,240
question let's say you have extreme rats

668
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,880
and you want you had a question about

669
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:17,470
the delivery mechanism and you know that

670
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,790
specific vendor is specialized in

671
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:21,850
extreme Erised you will go to that

672
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:23,139
specific vendor and finally like I

673
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:25,840
showed you earlier you can use

674
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:28,600
statistics also to reduce the noise so

675
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:31,080
50/50 is good enough hopefully you'll

676
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,080
get better

677
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:37,810
another interesting investigation tool

678
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:42,340
is what we call link analysis and this

679
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:45,520
is example from social network analysis

680
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:48,520
from 911 so this graph shows the

681
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:51,760
original suspect of the 9/11 attack and

682
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:55,870
what it illustrates is all the nineteen

683
00:32:51,760 --> 00:33:00,870
hijackers are within two steps from the

684
00:32:55,870 --> 00:33:04,270
original suspects coming in in 2000 also

685
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:07,780
by looking at the grass and the

686
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:10,180
egocentric part here we identified the

687
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:11,730
recruiter the leader we've recruited all

688
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:15,190
those hijackers

689
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:18,430
so this illustrate how you can use link

690
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:20,320
analysis in investigation identify who

691
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:22,419
are what are the answers in

692
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:24,549
question was what is the relationship

693
00:33:22,419 --> 00:33:27,940
between the recruiters and the hijackers

694
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:29,710
and we can drill down and do the same

695
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:33,690
thing with adversaries in the

696
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:35,830
cybersecurity world we can also create

697
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:38,110
relationship between transactions

698
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:40,960
relationship between objects between

699
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:44,258
servers between IP addresses so this is

700
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:47,320
an example of big panda which is a

701
00:33:44,259 --> 00:33:49,929
Chinese Chinese adversary actor and how

702
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:52,990
they relate to this the Kula malware

703
00:33:49,929 --> 00:33:55,330
family and you can see here this is

704
00:33:52,990 --> 00:34:01,029
coming in from a seagull and the graphic

705
00:33:55,330 --> 00:34:03,129
shows that want to I'm good that the

706
00:34:01,029 --> 00:34:05,860
deep plan that was connected to a

707
00:34:03,129 --> 00:34:08,440
specific IP that I see was a searcher

708
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:10,690
associated to this domain name who try

709
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:13,540
to spoof well point if they put one

710
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:15,970
instead of the El and well point is the

711
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:18,129
further is another name for anthem and

712
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:20,529
then you can go track back to the

713
00:34:18,129 --> 00:34:24,328
droppers and to the original malware and

714
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:24,329
to the stand book it was running under

715
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:33,849
so the way I see it threat intelligence

716
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:36,489
investigations is very close to any

717
00:34:33,849 --> 00:34:40,389
other investigation you have a cyber

718
00:34:36,489 --> 00:34:40,750
security area where you have a crime

719
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:42,700
scene

720
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:45,699
you have adversaries who are the

721
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:48,339
suspects right you have the fingerprints

722
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:52,449
who are the indicators you have the body

723
00:34:48,339 --> 00:34:56,290
who is the victim and you're trying to

724
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:58,868
solve a mystery and it's very similar to

725
00:34:56,290 --> 00:35:00,490
the game glue which I'm not aware of

726
00:34:58,869 --> 00:35:04,900
because I'm from Israel but they told me

727
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:07,959
you all will be aware of and and that

728
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:10,030
that is that is the way I look at it

729
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,890
it's almost like a detective work that's

730
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:14,500
why the human element is really

731
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:18,910
important here there are all questions

732
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:23,770
that no one by person with intuition

733
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:27,490
would be able to answer so one more

734
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:30,579
photo from a vacation and this is the

735
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:32,379
nightlife this is my daughter I didn't

736
00:35:30,579 --> 00:35:34,060
take many photos at the the night there

737
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:37,420
so sorry about the the quality

738
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:39,580
but I like it because she's much more

739
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:42,970
live by this band playing outside hotel

740
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:45,430
and what I like about it is that it

741
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:47,890
illustrates how a group of people can

742
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:50,500
create an experience that is much higher

743
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:53,319
than each of those people individually I

744
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:55,530
really like this photo and I think it's

745
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:58,630
also relevant to threat intelligence

746
00:35:55,530 --> 00:36:01,000
because threat intelligence teams work

747
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:03,670
in collaboration can create much better

748
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,700
results than each one of the individual

749
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:08,460
the collaboration is really relevant for

750
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:11,770
threat intelligence investigation

751
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:15,310
however I do believe machine learning

752
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:17,160
has some type of a role in threat

753
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:19,840
intelligence investigation in the future

754
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:22,180
so I can see how for example machine

755
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:25,690
learning classification algorithms can

756
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:28,440
create a prediction on whether an

757
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:31,150
indicator is a false positive or not

758
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:33,670
another example is decision trees I can

759
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:36,190
see how machine learning can create some

760
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:39,670
kind of a workflow for the aya team that

761
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:44,860
will be more informative than intuitive

762
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:49,240
for example so we're getting to the end

763
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:52,990
of fabrication and like I said machine

764
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:55,180
learning and human elements is something

765
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:57,129
we need to work together in order to get

766
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:59,560
a more efficient threat intelligence but

767
00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:01,300
what as we can learn about threat

768
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:04,840
intelligence efficiency how we can

769
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:08,500
really measure the effectiveness of our

770
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:12,490
work well the way I look at it is

771
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:15,460
looking at the time - detection in time

772
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:16,689
to respond so if there is anything

773
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:19,660
within the threat intelligence

774
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:22,240
activities we do that help reduce the

775
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:25,000
time the detection of time to respond we

776
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:29,370
did our work we contributed to the

777
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:32,050
technology we help to the defenses and

778
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:34,839
eventually I see the role of threat

779
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:37,330
intelligence is supporting the threat

780
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:40,740
defense effectiveness and said the

781
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:44,860
threat defense effectiveness is

782
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:46,520
basically a way for us to look at any

783
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:48,140
new technology getting into the

784
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:51,440
market if you're looking at any

785
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:55,580
technology at some point it is very

786
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:57,140
efficient like firewalls IDS's then the

787
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:59,029
adversary get ahold of this technology

788
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:01,940
and then they compromise they found all

789
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:03,770
those vulnerabilities and become much

790
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:06,110
less effective and then the vendors are

791
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:09,200
bouncing back and creating some some

792
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:11,750
type of sustaining kind of mode and so

793
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:14,089
our goal of threat intelligence teams is

794
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:17,060
to push this curve up into the right

795
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:19,520
into the red dotted line and make it

796
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:21,740
much more hard for the adversary to

797
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:24,259
attack us make it much more expensive

798
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:26,750
and less profitable for the attackers

799
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:29,300
help share our information with the

800
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:32,150
security operation teams would use the a

801
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:34,520
symmetric between us and the adversary

802
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:37,690
and eventually identify those

803
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:42,560
exploitations both in applications and

804
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:44,930
in credentials so getting back into

805
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:47,120
beginning threat intelligence is all

806
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:49,370
about this common ground

807
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:52,430
it's the overlap between the

808
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:54,470
organization goals from one side and the

809
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:58,990
threat intelligence landscape for the

810
00:38:54,470 --> 00:39:01,910
other so I want to thank my wife for

811
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:07,149
organizing a great vacation when I think

812
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:09,770
my keys were not so bad behavior and

813
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:13,460
those are the numbers that we spoke

814
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:17,150
about during the talk we talked about

815
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:20,020
how data sets will grow up continue to

816
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:22,750
go how we can use data mining for

817
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:26,030
classification and for scoring and how

818
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:29,000
investigation and effectiveness can help

819
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:31,420
us assess our 13 touches thanks and have

820
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,420
a great day

821
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:40,009
what any type of questions in anyone

822
00:39:37,009 --> 00:39:42,259
wants a shirt or a giveaway can come

823
00:39:40,009 --> 00:39:56,809
here but but meanwhile questions can

824
00:39:42,259 --> 00:39:58,609
anyone bring him there yeah yeah so we

825
00:39:56,809 --> 00:40:01,670
use threat intelligence feed to verify

826
00:39:58,609 --> 00:40:03,410
the link between threat actors so some

827
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:06,499
of the feeds our indicator base but

828
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:08,299
other ones are also related to specific

829
00:40:06,499 --> 00:40:09,950
adversaries the other thing we're doing

830
00:40:08,299 --> 00:40:12,440
is we cross correlate so if there are

831
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:15,529
two threat actors that for example share

832
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:17,299
the same infrastructure or there is some

833
00:40:15,529 --> 00:40:19,579
similarity between the two mal was

834
00:40:17,299 --> 00:40:23,140
coming in from them we can identify it

835
00:40:19,579 --> 00:40:23,140
within a threat intelligence platform

836
00:40:23,619 --> 00:40:29,029
yeah we're looking at specifically on

837
00:40:25,999 --> 00:40:31,819
malware's history of using them malware

838
00:40:29,029 --> 00:40:57,349
and the location if they are sharing the

839
00:40:31,819 --> 00:40:59,450
same infrastructure yes yes absolutely

840
00:40:57,349 --> 00:41:01,489
so the question was about the Carnegie

841
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:03,109
Hall paper which we already have it as

842
00:41:01,489 --> 00:41:06,140
well I was actually thinking maybe to

843
00:41:03,109 --> 00:41:08,119
put that as well I think the problem the

844
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:09,710
main problem is that there are different

845
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:11,210
ways to look at threat intelligence I

846
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:13,220
don't think any of the vendors is you

847
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:14,869
know giving you bad or trying to give

848
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:17,209
you bad data but I think each one of

849
00:41:14,869 --> 00:41:18,799
them is looking at different aspects the

850
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:20,480
fact that there is very little overlap

851
00:41:18,799 --> 00:41:23,420
between the attributes doesn't help it

852
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,920
and so I believe that unfortunately we

853
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:26,299
do need to take all those traits and

854
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,710
that would one threat intelligence

855
00:41:26,299 --> 00:41:29,630
platform that can process them and

856
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:32,589
filter the noise and get the right

857
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:34,759
indicators that's relevant to you

858
00:41:32,589 --> 00:41:36,380
internal intelligence is very important

859
00:41:34,759 --> 00:41:38,359
one of the things that I kind of

860
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:40,069
mentioned is that a lot of the feeds

861
00:41:38,359 --> 00:41:43,308
were using our internal feeds so it

862
00:41:40,069 --> 00:41:45,660
feeds from your end point solution speed

863
00:41:43,309 --> 00:41:48,870
from your firewall screen from your

864
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:50,879
seem your user behavior analytics close

865
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:54,350
correlated those with the external feeds

866
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,350
will give you the best intelligence

867
00:41:55,640 --> 00:42:00,699
thank you so much

868
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,699
