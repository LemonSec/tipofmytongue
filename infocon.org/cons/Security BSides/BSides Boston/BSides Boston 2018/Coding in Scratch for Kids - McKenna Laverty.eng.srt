1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,700
our zit yeah so thanks everybody for

2
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:08,460
sticking around this is actually going

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:11,940
to be my favorite presenter of the day I

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,389
think completely because she's my

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,360
daughter

6
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:17,100
so but she's going to be talking to us

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,529
today about the programming language

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:24,560
scratch and how it's for kids and maybe

9
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:27,599
for other people too so McKenna so

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:32,308
welcome to so welcome to scratch for

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:36,000
kids by me McKenna Laverty so who am i

12
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:37,828
anyway I'm McKenna Laverty and I'm an 11

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,840
year old sixth grader from Cumberland

14
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:43,050
Rhode Island I've been using scratch

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,200
since January 27th 2015 when my dad

16
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:50,010
introduced me to it and I'm racing Meyer

17
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:52,739
on scratch and how I started was I

18
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,750
wanted to make minecraft mods' so my dad

19
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:56,940
asked someone what would be a good way

20
00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:00,000
to get started and they suggested

21
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,968
scratch so a while later I was in my

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,090
bedroom and I heard meowing noises

23
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:09,060
coming from the coming from the living

24
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:12,510
room so we didn't have any cats at the

25
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:15,360
time we have two of them now and so

26
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,890
eventually I walked out into the living

27
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,049
room because what were these meowing

28
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,270
noise is coming from and it turned out

29
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:24,930
that it was my dad who was testing out

30
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:28,100
scratch and so I started playing with it

31
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:31,409
too and then the day after I signed up

32
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:33,119
so what is scratch anyway well it's the

33
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:35,729
programming it's a programming language

34
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,939
but it's for kids just like me and

35
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:41,520
adults can use it too and the

36
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:44,490
recommended age range is 8 to 16 but is

37
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:47,970
really for anyone so it was created by

38
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:51,570
MIT on March 5th 2007 you can find it at

39
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:56,219
scratch.mit.edu and it's completely free

40
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:58,289
to join and with 17 point 7 million

41
00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:02,100
members and nearly twenty one point six

42
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:04,439
million projects and this little orange

43
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:07,020
guy you see over here that's the scratch

44
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:07,750
that's the scratch mascot who does not

45
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,680
have an official

46
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:14,440
name but he's just the scratch cat so

47
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,840
the way the code is so the wave you code

48
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,760
and scratch is blocked so they have a

49
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:23,140
drag-and-drop KO style and there are a

50
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:25,600
total of 145 of them as scratch 2.0 the

51
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:27,220
most recent version and you can even

52
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,019
make custom blocks to do your own

53
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:31,270
functions just like you'd find in any

54
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:34,390
other code language except node blocks

55
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:37,570
and the blocks can even snap together an

56
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:39,899
interlock to create scripts so for

57
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:43,450
example what this script would do is

58
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:45,220
when the project first started so it

59
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:49,089
would do this code inside the loop

60
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:50,920
forever so it would move 15 pixels

61
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:54,100
across the screen in whatever direction

62
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:56,769
it was facing then turn to the right 10

63
00:02:54,100 --> 00:03:00,310
degrees a thought bubble would appear

64
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:02,920
above its head saying for 2 seconds it

65
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:04,780
will play a popping noise and then reset

66
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:10,390
its eyes and that would continue on

67
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:18,310
forever so the community is a very big

68
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:21,010
part of scratch and so so one of the

69
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:23,170
biggest parts of scratches communities

70
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:25,780
that you can share projects and keep

71
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:27,670
them hidden if you want to so because I

72
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:29,860
mainly use scratch for art and I have a

73
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:32,380
ton of different art projects most of

74
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:34,959
them stay hidden but I could do whatever

75
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:38,859
I want if I wanted to so you can also

76
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:41,410
comment on projects and scratch has and

77
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:44,079
scratch has a sensor to block out bad

78
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:45,790
words although you can put them in

79
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:50,320
projects that the project will very

80
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:52,780
likely be deleted and so a way to gain

81
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:56,350
reputation and scratch is my followers

82
00:03:52,780 --> 00:04:01,870
if your yeah if your projects are good

83
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:03,850
people will follow you and so just

84
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:06,310
generally the more famous scratchers

85
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:09,220
have more followers and there are even

86
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:13,170
studios which are like little clubs I

87
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:16,209
guess where you can add projects and

88
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:19,229
where you can add projects and comment

89
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:20,880
on studios and studios even have care

90
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:23,280
traders and managers which are just

91
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,680
people that can do more stuff with the

92
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:29,640
studio like adding projects changing the

93
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,590
name and changing its description so

94
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,990
here are some types of typical scratch

95
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:36,210
projects a lot of scratchers are

96
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:38,610
animators and will often make funny

97
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:42,330
animations all those scratchy animations

98
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:43,800
really can be anything and the main

99
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:45,659
reasons that a lot of people are

100
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,600
interested in scratch is so they can

101
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:50,940
make games and simple games are really

102
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,280
easy in scratch but then you get to the

103
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:55,530
more complex stuff and it looks like it

104
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,270
would take like weeks and weeks maybe

105
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:59,760
even months to make some of the more

106
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:01,590
complex stuff which I do have a really

107
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,210
good example of a complicated scratch

108
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:06,210
game I'll show you guys later

109
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:08,849
so you can also refactor other projects

110
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:11,010
also known as remix thing which gives

111
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:13,110
you your own copy of someone else's

112
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:16,830
project so you don't change the original

113
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:18,570
and you can just do whatever you want

114
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:21,300
with someone else's project and it

115
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:24,900
doesn't even and their original doesn't

116
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:27,150
even change it's just your version so

117
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:31,530
people can also make music in scratch

118
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:33,179
and using note blocks which are a

119
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:35,159
special kind of blocks that will play a

120
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:39,180
certain note for a certain amount of

121
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:41,280
time and another and another common type

122
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:44,460
of project in scratch that kind of ties

123
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,520
in with animations and music is m-80s

124
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,870
which the scratch team really likes and

125
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,609
basically what they are is one person

126
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:52,980
will take a song and cut it into parts

127
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:58,380
and other people will be able to take

128
00:05:52,980 --> 00:06:00,390
the parts and animate them so I so with

129
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,800
a lot of you being programmers I bet

130
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:05,190
you're going to be familiar with the

131
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,930
hello world scripts we're hello world if

132
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:08,610
you don't know it's usually the first

133
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:10,440
scripts that program will the

134
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:12,930
programmers will make when trying out a

135
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:16,080
new language and this is how to do it in

136
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:19,800
scratch one flag clicks say hello world

137
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:24,719
so my dad created this this wonderful

138
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:28,050
man right over here and it took maybe 30

139
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,540
seconds two minutes and he's totally new

140
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:33,050
so that just shows how easy it is to get

141
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:33,050
started

142
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:40,109
so here's some common types of scratch

143
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:42,600
blocks the start project block a k1 flag

144
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:44,880
click which one you click the green flag

145
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,060
button in the scratch interface which I

146
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,800
will also show you later

147
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:52,110
anything that is under anything that is

148
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:55,260
snapped to the underside of this block

149
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:57,510
will run this is the move this is the

150
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:59,940
move 10 this is the move certain amount

151
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:02,610
of steps block you can specify the

152
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:06,450
number or anything that has a little

153
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:11,250
white box like that you can specify so

154
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:14,010
and the sprite put character in the

155
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:16,560
project will just move a set amount of

156
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:20,840
pixels across the stage you can also

157
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:23,220
turn this right edge right and left and

158
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:27,690
you can just say how many degrees you

159
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:29,880
want it to turn and a lot of you are

160
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:32,969
probably familiar with variables which

161
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:35,460
is a way to store data inside code and

162
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:38,160
is commonly used for keeping score in

163
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,840
games and things like that so here are

164
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,800
some more common scratch blocks

165
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:47,549
there's the FL which you see over there

166
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:51,990
you can snap things with this shape into

167
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:53,910
there where if this happens then do

168
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:56,310
something that you can put into here if

169
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:58,349
that does not happen then do something

170
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,970
that you can put into here there is also

171
00:07:58,349 --> 00:08:03,630
a different version of this block that's

172
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:06,479
just if-then no else so and then we have

173
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:08,610
the sensing touching block which when

174
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,349
the when the spray is touching a certain

175
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:11,880
thing be it the mouse pointer or another

176
00:08:10,349 --> 00:08:15,120
sprite you can pick whatever you want

177
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:16,560
from a drop-down list it'll do a certain

178
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,860
thing because you can just put it right

179
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,620
in here and this is the RNG or random

180
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:25,919
number generator you can choose two

181
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:30,870
numbers and the and the sprite will

182
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:32,760
randomly pick a number between them so

183
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:35,429
another part of scratch that you don't

184
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:38,429
see very commonly but it's still pretty

185
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:41,370
cool is making a key which lets you turn

186
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:43,069
objects and two input and output devices

187
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:45,290
for your code

188
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:50,480
can be bananas a drawing alphabet soup

189
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:52,459
play-doh anything you want really and so

190
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:57,380
it relies on a board

191
00:08:52,460 --> 00:09:00,080
oops sorry so er lies on a board

192
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:04,900
alligator clips and a USB connector to

193
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:09,890
connect to your computer and do the code

194
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:12,350
so when I use to making Mickey it was at

195
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:13,010
scratch day which brings us to the next

196
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:17,930
slide

197
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:21,560
scratch outreach so MIT hosts a scratch

198
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:24,650
day every year in May usually it's on

199
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:29,329
the 14th but this year is on 6

200
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:31,310
I already got tickets and they're going

201
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:37,460
to be hundreds around the world not just

202
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:39,920
not just one in Cambridge and so and you

203
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:43,610
and you can also run unofficial meetup

204
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:46,219
group for scratch which are usually just

205
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:48,890
for like learning how to code and

206
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:50,780
beginners and things like that so and

207
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:54,350
even schools are using it to teach their

208
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:56,930
students how to code so now we get to

209
00:09:54,350 --> 00:10:07,790
the fun part who wants to see you

210
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:09,979
scratch demo alright so this is the

211
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:13,640
scratch front page I'm currently signed

212
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:19,810
in and so whenever you log on to scratch

213
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:25,400
this is what you see scratch mit.edu

214
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:29,689
remember that so then when you hit this

215
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:33,199
little create button up here it brings

216
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:35,270
you to the scratch editor which I've

217
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,120
already laid out a couple of blocks to

218
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:40,579
show you which you can select them from

219
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:43,880
here which will usually be referred to

220
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:46,640
as an API or application programmers

221
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:50,570
interface used to show all the things

222
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:53,569
you can do with code so we're always

223
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:55,930
going to start with this block one flag

224
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,930
click

225
00:10:56,089 --> 00:11:05,509
I don't mind it don't mind that just

226
00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:07,069
apparently I'm not signed in so so do

227
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:13,339
you want to see how the script can move

228
00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:17,569
across the screen so what it does is you

229
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:19,699
can drag the move ten steps over here so

230
00:11:17,569 --> 00:11:24,079
and I run the project click the green

231
00:11:19,699 --> 00:11:28,059
flag button and the sprite will move so

232
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:32,709
and then I can also get it to turn which

233
00:11:28,059 --> 00:11:32,709
let's say we want it to do this twice so

234
00:11:35,379 --> 00:11:42,019
when when you start up the project the

235
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:45,800
cat will move across the screen and turn

236
00:11:42,019 --> 00:11:48,470
15 degrees twice if you keep running it

237
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:54,559
you can see them just gradually moving

238
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:58,009
and spinning so here's another commonly

239
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:59,870
used thing in scratches let's just get

240
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:05,509
him to go back to his normal position I

241
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:07,999
guess so another commonly used thing for

242
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:11,589
beginner scratch projects is the say

243
00:12:07,999 --> 00:12:13,970
block where when you put this a little

244
00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:15,920
bubble will appear above the character's

245
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:18,759
head saying something so what do we want

246
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,759
the cat to say

247
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:36,149
so now when we run this project let's

248
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:38,490
just or is it just get them to 0.92

249
00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:44,670
degrees again so when we start this

250
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:47,060
project he will move 10 steps rotate and

251
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:51,000
say welcome to b-sides for 2 seconds and

252
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:54,089
then you can also use effect block where

253
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,029
the character can change color or do all

254
00:12:54,089 --> 00:13:00,570
these other things that you'll be able

255
00:12:57,029 --> 00:13:03,300
to experiment with on your own so now

256
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:06,800
when I run it he'll change color after

257
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,800
saying welcome to b-sides

258
00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:14,610
so see screen now and so then we can

259
00:13:12,329 --> 00:13:27,859
also get it to play sounds let's just

260
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:32,100
see if so now if we put that on there

261
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:33,959
he'll meow after all this let's just get

262
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:45,480
them to meow and say welcome to B sides

263
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:47,939
at the same time that'll be fun so now

264
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:51,720
another block that we can use is all

265
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:53,910
these lovely control blocks where the

266
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,339
first one we can get them to do

267
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:59,300
something forever

268
00:13:55,339 --> 00:13:59,300
we're basically

269
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:15,260
never going to stop so so now what we

270
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:19,120
can do is for Less obnoxiousness repeat

271
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:23,300
the forever block with repeat ten which

272
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:26,140
just lower this down for now he'll let

273
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,140
me do that four times

274
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:37,180
so now let's get another one of these

275
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:42,620
blocks in here

276
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:44,329
the if ends block so and this brings us

277
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:47,570
to our next block which we saw in an

278
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:49,400
earlier slide the touching block so

279
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:53,150
let's say if he's touching the mouse

280
00:14:49,400 --> 00:15:03,130
pointer he'll do this if he's not doing

281
00:14:53,150 --> 00:15:15,610
that he'll wait one second go to just

282
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:15,610
get him to go to some random place so

283
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:25,160
and let's throw an X zero throw a go to

284
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:30,859
block in there so he resets his position

285
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:33,530
at the start so now you can notice that

286
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:35,540
he waits one second and then just kind

287
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:43,060
of head bucks because he's a cat and

288
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:43,060
cats head but why isn't this working

289
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:52,880
let's just get rid of the else for now

290
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:56,500
and make this a regular if-then we're

291
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,500
having some technical difficulties

292
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:10,430
so this has no health part and will only

293
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:10,430
do this if it's doing a certain thing

294
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:21,780
what are you doing yeah I have to have

295
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:24,660
not worked with FM's in a while so I

296
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:26,339
can't remember how they work but now I

297
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:30,959
remember I have to put a forever block

298
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:33,740
in here which now I do not have to do it

299
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:43,320
the very beginning of the project and

300
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:46,730
instead it'll work forever I don't think

301
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,730
he likes being touched so much

302
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:10,670
poke so now do you want to see an

303
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,949
example of a really good complicated

304
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:14,900
scratch project should I think it's

305
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:22,160
actually the most famous scratch project

306
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:24,640
of all time oh sorry just just I'm just

307
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,800
I'm going to show you one more thing

308
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:32,090
where so now we can use the pick random

309
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:33,980
one to ten block where now you won't say

310
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:40,669
hello for two seconds he'll probably say

311
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:42,380
it for a bit longer so that's what you

312
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:47,630
can do with the pick random block it'll

313
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:53,809
pick a random number between whatever

314
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:58,850
you want you can change it so now we get

315
00:17:53,809 --> 00:18:02,120
onto the complicated advanced stuff so

316
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:08,050
this is a this is a scratch version of

317
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:11,689
Minecraft and you can see the code is

318
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:16,879
extremely long and I could never do this

319
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:24,650
in a million years would you put

320
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:26,720
something under your nope so yeah this

321
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:29,929
is just a crazy example of how

322
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,970
complicated scratch can be and then

323
00:18:29,929 --> 00:18:35,120
there are even more scripts you can just

324
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:40,360
go through the sprites and it's just so

325
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,360
many things in here insane

326
00:18:44,059 --> 00:19:00,289
so so yeah do we have any questions yeah

327
00:18:57,499 --> 00:19:03,440
I'd say the scratch community is pretty

328
00:19:00,289 --> 00:19:10,549
good in general so you can just kind of

329
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:13,969
click around like you can click on

330
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:17,269
people's projects and like I'm not

331
00:19:13,969 --> 00:19:22,299
actually going to post a comment on this

332
00:19:17,269 --> 00:19:22,299
guy's profile you can comment on things

333
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:38,089
you can love and favorite projects yeah

334
00:19:32,659 --> 00:19:38,659
back in I think 2015 I built I built

335
00:19:38,089 --> 00:19:42,080
this

336
00:19:38,659 --> 00:19:44,719
pretty big game that was supposed to be

337
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:48,019
like some sort of battle of my character

338
00:19:44,719 --> 00:19:51,279
and the coding is pretty impressive but

339
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:54,259
I but I think that I think that the idea

340
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:56,089
but I don't really like the whole idea

341
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:58,190
of it anymore like I still like the idea

342
00:19:56,089 --> 00:19:59,839
of a battle with your character but I

343
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:02,659
think even though the coding was good it

344
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:04,759
wasn't really well thought out but it

345
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:07,729
was still probably the best thing that

346
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:16,219
I've ever made on scratch so any other

347
00:20:07,729 --> 00:20:18,320
questions yeah I'm yeah I've tried to

348
00:20:16,219 --> 00:20:22,909
program with Python but I wasn't very

349
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:27,289
interested in it so yeah that was around

350
00:20:22,909 --> 00:20:36,409
when I started scratch I guess so now

351
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:39,139
I'll just make animations on scratch guy

352
00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:44,869
I don't know who the youngest person I

353
00:20:39,139 --> 00:20:46,968
know on scratch is the guy but I think

354
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:49,279
that but I think licks be on the stage

355
00:20:46,969 --> 00:20:51,130
you could easily find on scratch effects

356
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:54,190
and even

357
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:58,000
some parents will use scratch like the

358
00:20:54,190 --> 00:21:03,400
paper Minecraft I showed you was done by

359
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:06,430
is done by a parent yes

360
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:10,150
if we were to look at his profile so

361
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:14,860
there so there are about 17 million

362
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:17,370
scratchers and fifty-five thousand two

363
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:20,290
hundred ninety seven of them follow him

364
