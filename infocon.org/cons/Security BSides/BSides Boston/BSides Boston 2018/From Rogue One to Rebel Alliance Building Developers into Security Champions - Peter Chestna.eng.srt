7
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,970

friendly audience alright so be warned I

9
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,570
finished this this morning this is a

10
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,880
brand new talk so out of my cadence

11
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,859
might be a little bit off I'm welcome

12
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,869
any feedback you can tweet it at me or

13
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:30,689
give it to me in person or what have you

14
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:32,579
so what I'm here to tell is a little bit

15
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:34,170
about myself I've been an abstract for a

16
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:37,050
while so why am I here talking to you

17
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:40,920
guys I think of myself as the Babel Fish

18
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:42,718
between security and development I am a

19
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,160
developer I've been a developer for 25

20
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,989
years I've been at very code since 2006

21
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,300
built a security program a knapsack

22
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:53,940
program into our application development

23
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:59,038
process so I've been doing that for

24
00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:00,599
almost 11 years now and so I understand

25
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,579
both sides of the world so I get to go

26
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,610
out and talk to customers and prospects

27
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:08,250
about their apps tech programs what I've

28
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,560
seen work what I haven't seen work I get

29
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:14,250
to tell them about how we've done it at

30
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,900
my company oh yeah and I love whisky by

31
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,520
the way so if you ever want to talk to

32
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,380
me buy me a whisky elf civil around as

33
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,220
long as you want

34
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:22,020
ok so here's what we're going to talk

35
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,330
about I want to tell you a little bit

36
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,990
about security champions program who had

37
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:30,539
our so here who here is from security

38
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:35,100
who is a developer in the room about

39
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,900
quality all right operations all right

40
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,869
awesome

41
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:41,820
so security champions program I've seen

42
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:44,790
these a lot now this is really coming up

43
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:47,158
as a hot topic this is actually the

44
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:49,259
third of three different presentations

45
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:52,229
by three different presenters at my

46
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:54,240
company done from a p.m. point of view

47
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:56,399
from a security point of view and from

48
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,530
my point of view so we're going to talk

49
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,540
about building one what does it take

50
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:06,450
what do you use you know how do you sell

51
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:08,489
it etc so why do we even need one how

52
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:11,849
many people have an app set program at

53
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:13,650
that company ok how many people have an

54
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:17,548
app's tech program that has more than

55
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:22,909
and one person all right les hands above

56
00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:26,939
women five okay so it starts to shrink

57
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:30,298
let's think about what typical InfoSec

58
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:31,858
or seaso type roles are responsible for

59
00:02:30,299 --> 00:02:33,510
and this is really part of the problem

60
00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:37,500
because not every place that we go to

61
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:40,200
has an abscess team or an abscess

62
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,519
program right so that the security team

63
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,409
is responsible for physical security

64
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:47,250
their endpoint security

65
00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:49,858
they're responsible for D our intrusion

66
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,629
detection and prevention all this stuff

67
00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:56,730
right this all looks familiar to you

68
00:02:51,629 --> 00:03:00,629
guys and if you do have an AB set

69
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:02,488
program so if you're an InfoSec guy app

70
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:04,048
sack is like this tiny little part of

71
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:05,700
your job you have so many other

72
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:10,409
responsibilities so many other things

73
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:12,388
for you to worry about that if you do

74
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:14,879
have an AB set guy and you do have an AB

75
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:17,370
set program again you're being pulled in

76
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,750
multiple places because let's see from a

77
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:20,639
development point of view Waterfall

78
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:23,639
who's doing waterfall at their current

79
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:25,919
place don't be shy it's ok I know

80
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:27,090
there's at least a couple in here all

81
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:32,159
right they don't want to show themselves

82
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:35,579
about agile about DevOps ok

83
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:38,099
all right some of the same hands so if

84
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:40,109
you think about a large company right

85
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:43,500
I've got dozens I might have hundreds of

86
00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:45,060
teams that I'm responsible for thousands

87
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,129
of applications some of the abstract

88
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:49,109
programs that I've seen have five or

89
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:50,909
10,000 applications that need to be

90
00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:55,109
secured to me how the hell do you do

91
00:03:50,909 --> 00:03:57,418
that with any size team you need to do

92
00:03:55,109 --> 00:04:00,169
risk assessment you're doing maybe who

93
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:03,299
does manual pen testing in their company

94
00:04:00,169 --> 00:04:06,359
ok who does only manual pen testing in

95
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:08,879
their company again people don't what if

96
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:10,349
she I don't want to show you need to do

97
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,810
external Atta stations if you're a

98
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:14,760
vendor and you're reporting across

99
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:16,709
across the organization so you have all

100
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,620
this stuff to support as part of your

101
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:23,039
app sect program so why don't we just

102
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,980
hire more people like the giggle thank

103
00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:26,870
you

104
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:28,760
yeah for every four people that are

105
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:30,920
employed there's three job openings is

106
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:33,380
not enough of us out there to go do a

107
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:37,250
credible job at securing this this

108
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:39,140
landscape and as we've heard every

109
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,640
company is a software company every

110
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:43,400
single one and we've been saying that

111
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:45,860
where I work for over ten years

112
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:48,950
right FedEx is a software company that

113
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:51,080
delivers packages Amazon is a software

114
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:55,280
company that sells everything on the

115
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:57,380
planet right secure software runs every

116
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,729
single business you cannot get as fast

117
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:03,409
or as scaled as you want without

118
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:05,540
software well while we just read team

119
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:08,740
and pen test the applications of death

120
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:11,090
now there's a anyone know Shannon lights

121
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:13,910
she works for him to it she runs their

122
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:16,609
red team program remarkable she's very

123
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:19,580
very talented very smart she talks about

124
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:21,200
her red team and you know how many

125
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:23,510
people she has on board I think she's

126
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:26,210
got like a team of like 15 people like

127
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:28,640
super skilled and who has the money for

128
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:30,640
that right so we think about Reggie who

129
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:35,090
has a red team program at their company

130
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:37,400
won right it's it's rare it's rare to be

131
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:39,049
able to have white hats inside of your

132
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:43,280
organization that are trying to break in

133
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:45,230
it is so expensive to do and we only

134
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,390
want to really do it so for the rest of

135
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:49,940
us that have to rely on third parties to

136
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:51,320
come in and help us with pen testing we

137
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:56,120
only want to do it on the most critical

138
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:57,170
things write it in by the way it's too

139
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,240
late in the process so if you think

140
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:00,650
about a typical AB sec program in SDLC

141
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,260
right from the time that i think about

142
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:04,250
it at a time that it's in production if

143
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,289
they're sitting there at the gate

144
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,790
waiting to release their software that's

145
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:10,700
the wrong time we tell them they got

146
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:12,710
three hundred things to go and fix right

147
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,599
it just leads to friction they get

148
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:16,310
aggravated at you they don't want to

149
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,190
talk about security they try to avoid

150
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:22,610
talking to you so we need to find a

151
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:24,770
better way of doing that it's also too

152
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:27,140
slow so even if you have internal pen

153
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:29,930
testers we're talking days or or weeks

154
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:32,390
to get a pen test done and a lot of that

155
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:35,180
time is idle time so who here has

156
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:38,010
studied lean manufacturing Toyota Way

157
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:40,170
kind of stuff couple all right so

158
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:41,730
it's on the reading list of things that

159
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:43,500
you might want to go and look at it's

160
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:46,140
tight it talks about reducing or

161
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,790
eliminating waste in the cycle of how

162
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:49,229
you build things and it could be

163
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:53,070
physical things it could be software

164
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:54,570
again it's how long does it sit waiting

165
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:57,180
for the pen tester to come and then they

166
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:59,250
do their work right so that that part is

167
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:01,440
wasteful if we use an external one it

168
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,850
could be months for you to line them up

169
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,469
for them to have a coverage call to

170
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:06,810
figure out you know what's the scope of

171
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:09,930
the pen test how do we do it and if you

172
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:12,420
also if you think about it of all the

173
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:14,430
things that they could test it can only

174
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:16,790
test this little tiny amount out of

175
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:19,230
everything a couple of percent maybe

176
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:23,730
unless you're you know you've got a huge

177
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:25,020
team in lots of time it's also not

178
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:26,910
cost-effective for simple

179
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:28,169
vulnerabilities so in the last talk

180
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:31,410
who's talking about some free stuff that

181
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:33,480
will go out and find things doing static

182
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:35,430
analysis will find a lot of those

183
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,920
vulnerabilities really early when

184
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:39,630
they're really cheap to fix before the

185
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,250
code is actually running you can use

186
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:43,770
dynamic analysis in the same way you're

187
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:46,260
finding things before you release again

188
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:48,450
it's more cost effective than what you

189
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:50,159
want to use a human for so we do have

190
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:52,469
room for pen testers in this world right

191
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,150
we absolutely need them someone to sit

192
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:56,880
in front of a screen and infer what the

193
00:07:54,150 --> 00:08:00,630
system is doing behind the scenes right

194
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:02,250
that computers can't do so you need to

195
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:04,710
sit there walk through these workflows

196
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:06,420
say ah I see what just happened there

197
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,799
let me see if this is actually doing

198
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:12,360
what I think it is and do some more

199
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:15,390
probing testing again you can't find

200
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:18,360
hire them can't afford them they're

201
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:19,830
super expensive alright so who has a

202
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:24,720
security gate before they really

203
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:27,300
software in their company ok I saw some

204
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,420
of this right so that's the well kinda

205
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:34,799
so which outcome do you see when these

206
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:36,870
guys come to you is it this one ok we

207
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:41,130
how many times have you seen that or

208
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:43,229
it's the you put the gate down and then

209
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:45,030
they cry to their manager who cries to

210
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:46,470
the VP who eventually goes to the CIO

211
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:48,150
and then you get the phone call over the

212
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:49,890
security team say why are you guys

213
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,810
standing in the way I need my software

214
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:53,080
released

215
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:56,569
get it out there you have to do this

216
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:58,400
where is this one it's hard gate and

217
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:01,250
they try to go through it they try to go

218
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:03,350
under it usually it ends up like this if

219
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:05,480
you have a sturdy gate that you can

220
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:06,890
enforce this is the behavior you're

221
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:10,940
going to see right

222
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:12,890
we hope all right so now let's talk

223
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:14,330
about development methodology so people

224
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:16,580
said no one's doing waterfall I don't

225
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:18,860
believe it but okay or they're doing

226
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:20,120
agile fall or something like that so

227
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,610
let's talk about calendar time right so

228
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:25,880
if we're talking about waterfall type

229
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:27,620
methodologies I may be doing one to four

230
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,270
releases here that's about the best you

231
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:31,640
can do and these are huge teams by the

232
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:34,730
way they release big chunks of software

233
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:37,850
with lots of risk in it right but these

234
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:41,390
you know 100 person teams go really slow

235
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:42,650
usually miss deadlines agile so we're

236
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:44,240
going to start speeding up now right so

237
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:46,730
we go from a team of like 100 to maybe a

238
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,800
team of six to twelve and we're talking

239
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:51,890
about maybe we do it monthly maybe we do

240
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:55,010
it a couple times a month or if we go to

241
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:56,600
DevOps now we're we're cooking right now

242
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:59,439
we're talking about hundreds of releases

243
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:01,610
a year sometimes tens of releases a day

244
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,620
so how does the security guy keep up

245
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:05,690
with all that stuff right so if you

246
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:08,600
think back to I only got a couple of

247
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:10,640
them and I've got hundreds of teams and

248
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,980
thousands of applications and they're

249
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,949
all releasing multiple times a day

250
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:19,339
what's a security guy to do how do you

251
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:22,490
fix that problem so here is the the kind

252
00:10:19,339 --> 00:10:25,400
of DevOps lifecycle so for if you

253
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:27,470
haven't seen this before in a DevOps

254
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,180
team the the theory is that the team

255
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:30,980
owns it from cradle to grave so from the

256
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:32,780
time you think about doing a project

257
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:34,820
until the time you retire it and turn it

258
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:37,370
off in production the team owns the

259
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:41,390
whole thing right so where's security in

260
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:43,010
this usually again when you start off

261
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:45,199
with waterfall or agile usually it's

262
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:48,050
there right testing that's when we do

263
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,510
our testing we test at the end but

264
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:52,279
really this is what we need to think

265
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:54,529
about and it's the same thing we've

266
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:57,950
learned with agile right so in agile

267
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:59,720
methodologies we combine QA and

268
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:01,490
development to say hey let's think about

269
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,890
quality the whole way let's make sure

270
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:04,080
that when it when we say we're done and

271
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:10,250
me

272
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:13,800
it works okay who is familiar with this

273
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:17,550
couple all right so this is classic

274
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:20,069
chart talks about agile methodology so

275
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:21,930
in a nutshell we start over here on the

276
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:24,060
left with our backlog right

277
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:25,800
this is backlog is put together by

278
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:29,369
someone called a product owner so this

279
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:32,099
is a role on a scrum team in agile this

280
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:34,380
list a list of things is ordered

281
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:36,899
usually by importance usually by amount

282
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:38,670
of money we can make off the feature in

283
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:40,500
again if we look at the waterfall

284
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:41,910
projects we're looking out trying to

285
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,860
figure out what people will buy in a

286
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:45,149
year and we're usually wrong what we're

287
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,740
doing here is we're saying hey I know

288
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:49,170
the next couple of weeks or the next

289
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:51,959
quarter what things I need to prepare

290
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:55,500
and get out to the field so that list is

291
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:58,949
smaller more concise and easily seen and

292
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:01,680
viewed and understood so we take that

293
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:03,029
list and we go to our team and we have

294
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,410
what's called a grooming session where

295
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:06,630
we talk about these what are called

296
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:09,360
stories so everyone in this is a story

297
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:11,550
so as something I want to do something

298
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,320
with this product and it will do great

299
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:14,819
things for me right so this kind of way

300
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,110
those things are written we take those

301
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:18,000
stories we go into the team so if this

302
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:20,579
is my agile team over here we're sitting

303
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,380
talking about the story once everyone's

304
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:24,209
agreed that they understand it now we

305
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:25,640
test for understanding so we do

306
00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:27,599
something called planning poker in

307
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:29,130
planning poker you actually have a deck

308
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,200
of cards they have some virtual ones you

309
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:32,880
use on your phone but the team sits in

310
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,380
the room and they say all right based on

311
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,529
some standards so let's say that you

312
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:39,680
know this is a 1 again it's just a rant

313
00:12:37,529 --> 00:12:41,850
it's a it's a number that's meant to be

314
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,790
relative to something else so if this is

315
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:48,270
how big a one is right so this would be

316
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:51,060
a 2 we say all right on the count of 3

317
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:56,130
you tell me how big this story is and it

318
00:12:51,060 --> 00:13:02,760
goes 1 2 I can't remember now 5 7 its

319
00:12:56,130 --> 00:13:04,380
Fibonacci ish 1320 infinity and so we'll

320
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,880
pull out cards on three and everyone

321
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:08,370
will show them to everybody else and

322
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,649
I'll get a 1 here I'll get a 13 up there

323
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:12,540
I'll get a 5 over here of like well

324
00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:15,540
clearly we do not understand what we're

325
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:16,980
doing yet because the whole goal is we

326
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,550
need to really understand it because

327
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,680
we're real

328
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:21,149
going to commit to doing it so now we'll

329
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,709
go through some negotiation we'll ask

330
00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:24,420
the guy that said of one it's like why

331
00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:26,130
do you think it's so easy that guy said

332
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:28,260
it's a thirteen why do you think it's so

333
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:30,750
hard the guy in the middle what what are

334
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:33,540
you seeing until we come to some kind of

335
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:35,130
reasonable consensus where maybe we say

336
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,480
it's a five or seven s like ha I

337
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:38,130
understand your point I forgot about

338
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,959
that it's usually things that aren't

339
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:42,630
written down inside of that story what

340
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:45,300
we call acceptance criteria or story

341
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:46,800
descriptions so now once we've done that

342
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:49,319
we're going to say all right so for this

343
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,760
side team we usually do about this many

344
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,110
stories so we're going to pull those off

345
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,760
the backlog and we're and say this is

346
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:55,260
what we're committing to as a team this

347
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,390
is what's different than what you do

348
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:59,279
inside a waterfall in waterfall everyone

349
00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:01,110
get their own set of work and we move

350
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,120
along and we hope we get to the at the

351
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:05,490
end and we get something out of it in

352
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,959
agile what we do is we say alright we're

353
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:09,060
going to commit to this as a team and

354
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,739
once we do that we're going to stand up

355
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:13,589
every single day it's called a stand up

356
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:15,360
whole team gets together and we say well

357
00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:18,180
what did i do yesterday what am i doing

358
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,040
today what's blocking me it is run by

359
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:21,899
I'm going to call a scrum master again

360
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:24,060
another role inside of a scrum team now

361
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:26,310
this scrum master will say all right

362
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,750
well you said you're blocked and you

363
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:30,000
said you finished early so why don't we

364
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:31,560
have you come and help the whole point

365
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,720
is as a team we're going to succeed or

366
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:37,109
fail right we're going to track it

367
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,220
visually electronically usually and at

368
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,510
the end we're going to reflect on it

369
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,899
what do we do well what didn't we do

370
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:44,160
well

371
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:47,070
now usually Security's here right

372
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,380
they're looking from afar hoping the

373
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:51,180
things are going well and get to those

374
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,860
gates and you know bad stuff happens and

375
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:54,839
what ends up happening is we fight for

376
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,040
budget so when they come to us with

377
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:57,750
something that they want to release the

378
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:00,180
Haake ready to ship this water now it's

379
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:02,760
like well you know I found these 10

380
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:04,829
things it seems like well I want to

381
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:07,140
release tomorrow can we just fix the

382
00:15:04,829 --> 00:15:11,189
most important ones who's had that

383
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:13,730
conversation everybody well what if we

384
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:16,050
just fix the top - is that good enough

385
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:17,430
so you're fighting for budget with those

386
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:18,750
teams and that's not really the role

387
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:19,500
that you want to play that's not really

388
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:22,949
where you want to be

389
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:25,230
so let's look quickly at how DevOps

390
00:15:22,949 --> 00:15:27,420
evolved so here's the typical waterfall

391
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:30,540
where we've got these silos of people

392
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,959
right so I got my people that tell me

393
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,490
what I'm

394
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,810
to do the people that do it people have

395
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:36,600
tested and they're the people that run

396
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:38,699
it we have these handoffs so what

397
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,610
happens is from the left one we sit

398
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:43,980
right down what we want to do as soon as

399
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:46,470
it clears that wall to the next team we

400
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:48,300
start to lose the focus on what the hell

401
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:50,430
that was supposed to do so by the time

402
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:52,500
it gets into operations they don't know

403
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:53,670
why we built it they don't know what

404
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,339
it's really supposed to do they just

405
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:58,819
know how it works the same thing with

406
00:15:56,339 --> 00:16:00,839
the application it works as it's written

407
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:02,190
but not necessarily the way it was

408
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:04,230
intended so they don't have that

409
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:06,630
knowledge they don't understand that and

410
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:08,970
in the opposite sense from our

411
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:10,170
operations team they understand how it

412
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:12,149
works they're the ones fighting the

413
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:14,370
fires every day but that information

414
00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:17,339
never really makes it all the way to the

415
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:18,779
team so in an agile what we did was we

416
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:19,320
said let's start breaking down some

417
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:21,510
walls

418
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:23,130
let's put quality together with the

419
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:25,649
people that write what we're supposed to

420
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:27,570
do and the people that actually do it so

421
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:28,860
now my developers are starting to think

422
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,510
more about qualities where you know

423
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:32,820
test-driven development started to come

424
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:34,860
into play let's think about testing from

425
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:36,510
the time that we start to work so what

426
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:39,630
you see now is there's much better

427
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:41,640
continuity from a business idea approach

428
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:43,770
and from how the application works on

429
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:47,670
that team but we still have this reverse

430
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:49,709
problem in operations in DevOps and

431
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:52,500
we'll drop security in here somewhere

432
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:54,209
but this is the typical model right if

433
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,040
everyone's on the same team the

434
00:16:54,209 --> 00:16:57,839
operations of guys are there when the

435
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,219
p.m. or the product owner says hey

436
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,720
here's what we want to build here's the

437
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:02,910
audience that's meant for here's how

438
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,740
it's supposed to work they can report

439
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:06,240
back to the team and say hey it's not

440
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,829
working the way we intended you guys

441
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,079
need to do some changes around this

442
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:12,030
thing and we really have a very good

443
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:15,240
understanding across the board and we

444
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:18,089
end up writing better software all right

445
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:20,819
so we realize we need some more people

446
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:23,280
again moving it earlier is always better

447
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:24,389
we call a shifting left there's a lot of

448
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,399
companies out there talking about

449
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:27,900
shifting left which means going to the

450
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,880
place where the code starts to get

451
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:33,360
written that's the time or even before

452
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:35,220
that is when we need to get involved so

453
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,419
as we sell this program the intent of

454
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,970
this is we're going to have 1 or 2

455
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:41,700
people on every single team write at

456
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:43,480
least one we like some redundancy so

457
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,820
maybe two people if you can afford to

458
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:48,280
that when we talk to manager we need to

459
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:49,629
say hey look we're going to fit into

460
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,879
your existing process we're not going to

461
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:54,340
slow you down we want to make sure that

462
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,870
you think about security from day one

463
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,790
such that we don't end up with this

464
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:59,379
nightmare at the end these kyouno trucks

465
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:02,918
crashing into gates or driving around

466
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:04,179
the driving around the gate so we need

467
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:05,590
to think about this is there's an

468
00:18:04,179 --> 00:18:08,410
investment up front right this is not

469
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:10,720
free lunch but eventually what you want

470
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:12,630
is this preventative measure so if you

471
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,919
think about security right the best

472
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:16,870
defect is one that was never written I

473
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:18,130
want to train my developers in such a

474
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:20,110
way that it comes out of their fingers

475
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:21,610
secure so I'm not doing the application

476
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:23,668
security at the end and having to track

477
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:26,770
these defects and fight for budget on

478
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:28,600
the team there's less waiting so we want

479
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:29,139
everything on the team in agile and

480
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,730
DevOps

481
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:32,679
what you want is everyone that's

482
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:35,650
responsible and needed to do a project

483
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:37,210
to be there right to be part of this

484
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:39,480
team so we don't have these handoff like

485
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:41,919
we talked about with pen testing and

486
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:44,770
from an individual perspective if you

487
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,970
are one of the security champions you're

488
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:47,830
going to get additional training you

489
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:49,480
become more valuable not only to the

490
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:52,299
company of the ers but the next company

491
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:54,630
you go to right we I was talking to some

492
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:57,780
of my workmates before about that

493
00:18:54,630 --> 00:19:00,880
transition from security champion into

494
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:02,950
more of a security role it's kind of the

495
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,049
bridge between development and security

496
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:06,640
so this is a good place to start in a

497
00:19:05,049 --> 00:19:11,230
place where it might scratch an itch you

498
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:14,980
didn't even know you had so we got to

499
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:16,480
describe the job to them so the job is

500
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:19,600
really about grooming so remember we

501
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,330
talked in that agile slide about this

502
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,879
backlog in the grooming session so now

503
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:26,199
not only are we going to talk about

504
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,419
stories from the perspective of how is

505
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:31,660
it supposed to work but what are the

506
00:19:28,419 --> 00:19:33,669
threats how can this be attacked what

507
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:36,370
kind of security testing do I need to do

508
00:19:33,669 --> 00:19:38,140
on this and in some cases static

509
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:39,790
analysis is perfectly fine we'll take

510
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:41,410
that cheap route maybe we want to do

511
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:43,030
dynamic analysis maybe we need pen

512
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:45,370
testing on this maybe this is some kind

513
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:47,350
of critical control this is the place we

514
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:51,100
want to analyze and understand that

515
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:53,559
because in agile what you want is in

516
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:55,209
DevOps as well when you say done really

517
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:56,658
done like I put it down I don't have to

518
00:19:55,210 --> 00:20:00,080
pick it up again pencils down

519
00:19:56,659 --> 00:20:01,999
test is over kind of thing right so how

520
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,070
do we get them to understand all of the

521
00:20:01,999 --> 00:20:08,539
things that they need to do to make sure

522
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:11,899
that it's really done Billo materials so

523
00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:12,830
open source risk they need to understand

524
00:20:11,899 --> 00:20:15,590
the components that they're bringing

525
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:18,859
into their applications because when we

526
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:21,499
have something like strut shock or shell

527
00:20:18,859 --> 00:20:24,879
shock or heartbleed or you know the DC

528
00:20:21,499 --> 00:20:27,379
realization problem in Apache Commons

529
00:20:24,879 --> 00:20:29,629
you need someone to go to if I have

530
00:20:27,379 --> 00:20:33,369
thousands of applications and they

531
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:35,949
announce patchy Commons is now screwed

532
00:20:33,369 --> 00:20:38,959
where where is it in your enterprise

533
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:40,669
which teams do I need to go talk to how

534
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,440
are we going to fix it on what time

535
00:20:40,669 --> 00:20:44,690
frame do I need to put mitigations in

536
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,489
place until then that's the thing where

537
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:49,190
your security champions become part of

538
00:20:46,489 --> 00:20:50,840
your incident response and say guys help

539
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:52,429
me out here here's the problem here's

540
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:54,978
what it looks like here's how it can be

541
00:20:52,429 --> 00:20:56,840
affected go get me a report back on

542
00:20:54,979 --> 00:21:00,830
where you are what you're doing about it

543
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:02,720
and how soon you can have it fixed right

544
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:04,639
so this is right response team here

545
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,489
secure code review so we're going to

546
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:09,590
teach them some basics right they're not

547
00:21:07,489 --> 00:21:10,970
the be-all end-all they are not security

548
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:12,529
experts but we're going to build some

549
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:14,479
knowledge into them so they can do a lot

550
00:21:12,529 --> 00:21:17,899
of the basic stuff that we need to have

551
00:21:14,479 --> 00:21:19,429
done on a regular basis in the other

552
00:21:17,899 --> 00:21:20,508
conscience of security so they're the

553
00:21:19,429 --> 00:21:21,049
ones that sit in the room and think

554
00:21:20,509 --> 00:21:24,259
about it

555
00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:26,720
you can't be at every meeting you can't

556
00:21:24,259 --> 00:21:28,070
be in every discussion but these guys

557
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,419
again we're talking a team of six to

558
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:31,759
twelve people they usually sit near each

559
00:21:29,419 --> 00:21:33,859
other usually talking all the time when

560
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:36,859
things go by like up security over here

561
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:38,509
we need to think about this right you

562
00:21:36,859 --> 00:21:43,340
need someone to be that eyes and ears

563
00:21:38,509 --> 00:21:47,059
for you so recruiting so you recruit

564
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:50,209
these people again we're going to use

565
00:21:47,059 --> 00:21:54,349
one to two members volunteers our best

566
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:55,999
but voluntold is okay I don't love I

567
00:21:54,349 --> 00:21:57,649
don't love that model but we want to get

568
00:21:55,999 --> 00:21:59,299
them to the point where they're like wow

569
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:02,119
I really want to do this because you

570
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:06,200
want people that that are excited by

571
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:08,449
this challenge a problem that we had

572
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,480
initially when we when we did this was

573
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:12,400
we took the people that volunteered

574
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,660
but that's not necessarily the people

575
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,610
you want we need people that are

576
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:17,590
influential on that team so usually it's

577
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:19,178
your young go-getter that maybe join the

578
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:20,730
company a couple weeks ago or a couple

579
00:22:19,179 --> 00:22:23,200
months ago or maybe a couple years ago

580
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:25,179
but it's not really a senior member or

581
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,980
an influencer or on that team you need

582
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:28,360
to think about whether or not when they

583
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:29,980
say security everyone looks and says

584
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:32,500
what do you mean security instead of a

585
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:34,480
security and they look elsewhere right

586
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:37,000
so you need the right kind of people so

587
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,350
think about that model and again it

588
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,549
doesn't have to be a developer it could

589
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:47,020
be a QA person so let's talk about what

590
00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:48,460
you don't want on your team so I guess

591
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,690
before a new employee I don't want

592
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,070
someone just coming into the company

593
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:52,720
doesn't really understand the product

594
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:54,129
doesn't understand this getting up to

595
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,090
speed on so many other things and now

596
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:56,350
we're going to fill them with more

597
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:59,500
training it's going to the message is

598
00:22:56,350 --> 00:23:02,110
going to be diluted so we don't want

599
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:03,760
someone that's doing that we don't want

600
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:06,639
an existing scrum roll so the product

601
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,169
owner has a job already the scrum master

602
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,880
has a job already and they might

603
00:23:08,169 --> 00:23:12,010
actually be coding on the team as well

604
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:13,299
we can't burden them with this other

605
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:14,860
thing and in fact we'd like that

606
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:16,270
division of labor I mean security loves

607
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:18,250
that stuff right let's talk about

608
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:19,570
splitting this labor up I want my

609
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:21,280
product owner the person that's writing

610
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:22,990
the stories to be the one that's trying

611
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:26,100
to put security into it as well let's

612
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:29,890
look at it from a different angle

613
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:32,559
training got to train them at at very

614
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:36,429
code there's a two day or two and a half

615
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:37,899
day intensive in-person training what we

616
00:23:36,429 --> 00:23:40,179
talk to them about a whole bunch of

617
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:42,040
important stuff all right so we talked

618
00:23:40,179 --> 00:23:43,570
about security fundamentals things that

619
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:45,790
they don't think about they were never

620
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:47,620
trained on for the software developers

621
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:51,309
in the room who took a security course

622
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:54,820
security coding course in college two

623
00:23:51,309 --> 00:23:56,649
three okay yeah most of us are not

624
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:58,330
trained in this I did this I graduated

625
00:23:56,650 --> 00:24:00,730
twenty five years ago they didn't have

626
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:03,909
any application security or secure

627
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:06,220
coding type constructs it's starting to

628
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:07,960
come about now but it's still this is a

629
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:09,520
workforce that you have to invest in

630
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,590
right they don't have this stuff already

631
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,139
so we talked to him about CI a we've

632
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:16,928
talked about you know zero trust we

633
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:19,900
trust nothing you have to verify it deny

634
00:24:16,929 --> 00:24:23,710
by default defensive depth we do catch

635
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:24,250
the flag II exercises too so every once

636
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:26,740
a week on

637
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:28,300
I think Tuesdays at lunch our security

638
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:30,040
expert will go into the cafeteria with

639
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,330
his laptop they'll have something ready

640
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,950
for the team and they'll say hey let's

641
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:34,629
talk about this from the hacker point of

642
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:37,600
view get them to understand the other

643
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:39,040
side to make sure that they understand

644
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,230
what they're trying to protect against

645
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:43,889
and how easy it is sometimes to break

646
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,890
into these things

647
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:48,689
so a little bit about grooming

648
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:51,160
guidelines again when we talk about

649
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:52,570
grooming in the typical sense and agile

650
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:55,300
we're talking about understanding what

651
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:58,090
functionality is to be provided and this

652
00:24:55,300 --> 00:25:00,639
is non-functional requirements we want

653
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:04,600
to talk about how we're going to protect

654
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,950
this thing from malicious use so is this

655
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,500
and this is a checklist that you can

656
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:11,170
provide this is just a sample is this a

657
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:13,360
new feature that you're introducing does

658
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:15,460
it have new API endpoints that we want

659
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,199
to think about testing their new UI

660
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:18,610
elements that we need to think about how

661
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,550
they might be maliciously used new

662
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:23,260
architectures especially who's doing

663
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:25,960
like monolithic application development

664
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:29,320
like being clunking java things yeah

665
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:30,280
who's doing micro-services all right so

666
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:33,129
you need to understand how about

667
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:34,480
containerization there's a big one right

668
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:36,220
so you need to think about those

669
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,020
deployment models those architectural

670
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:41,110
models from the security standpoint to

671
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:42,639
say am I just shipping software faster

672
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:44,560
with more security vulnerabilities in it

673
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,180
how do I think about that architecture

674
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:48,129
and how it needs to be secured how do I

675
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:49,750
think about containerization and what

676
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:51,310
containers I start with and what goes

677
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:55,300
into them before they get into

678
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:58,179
production am i introducing new security

679
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:59,889
controls into the application you know

680
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:03,010
is it new permissions new roles new

681
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:04,750
rights new encoders that I want to take

682
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:06,760
a close look at because the last thing

683
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:08,110
you want is to just kind of do those

684
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,879
things like oh yeah we understand the

685
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:11,740
security stuff those are points where we

686
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,920
want to bring in a security expert to

687
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:17,590
validate that we did it the right way

688
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:20,200
new forms or actions is it a fix for a

689
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:21,699
pen test finding again it's a place

690
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:26,530
where you want to have an expert come in

691
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:27,760
and say yeah you did it right is it

692
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:30,070
happening in authentication or

693
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,810
authorization is it affecting my crypto

694
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:33,760
or my data validation you know all of

695
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:35,470
these things that we worry about it's

696
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,790
security professionals we need to

697
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:39,940
enforce and

698
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:42,280
helped those security champions

699
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:43,780
understand that all this stuff is

700
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:45,340
important you know what do you think

701
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:47,200
about cash management how does that get

702
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:49,270
flushed what you know what's the refresh

703
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,830
rate on that who gets access to that all

704
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:52,270
these things we have to give them a

705
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:54,699
checklist if it looks like any of this

706
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:58,210
stuff it's a duck I need to talk to you

707
00:26:54,700 --> 00:27:01,180
about it all right so before I said

708
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:01,600
where I'd train them to do security code

709
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,070
reviews

710
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,010
now this isn't like I said this isn't

711
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:07,330
deep deep deep analysis we're going to

712
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:08,650
give them some of the fundamentals and

713
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:09,939
by the way we're going to guide them

714
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:12,190
through this process we'll start small

715
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:14,560
will validate that they're doing the

716
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:15,790
right things and add more as they go we

717
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,889
have some people that have been doing

718
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:20,379
this for years that are excellent at it

719
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:21,610
and some people that are newer to it

720
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:23,080
that are struggling so you need to

721
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:27,790
understand that balance of who you

722
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:29,470
should be spending time with so we'll

723
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:32,110
teach them how to do basic data valid

724
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:34,000
look at data validation or encoding or

725
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:37,740
parameterization logging and error

726
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:41,050
handling we want to do a lot of

727
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:42,430
mentoring with them so some classroom

728
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:44,110
training we're going to give them like a

729
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:46,470
code review test here's something I want

730
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:48,909
you to go look at tell me what you find

731
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:51,640
then we're going to do some one-on-one

732
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:53,440
meetings with them talk to about the

733
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,540
process of a secure code review it's

734
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,310
different than a peer code review that

735
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:59,950
you're just looking at the code for you

736
00:27:57,310 --> 00:28:01,300
know four simple errors we want to make

737
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:02,860
sure that they understand how to go

738
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:04,270
about this and give them strategies for

739
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:06,030
doing this because they've never had to

740
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:08,740
think of it from this angle

741
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:11,649
usually we'll have them shoulder surf us

742
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:13,840
so we'll do the code review they'll see

743
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:15,250
what the methods that we use then we'll

744
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,870
ask we'll do the same thing so that's

745
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:19,000
why Yoda's on the back right he's now

746
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:22,050
he's shoulder surfing understanding what

747
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,370
Luke is doing in his secure code review

748
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:27,520
to make sure that he understands the

749
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:30,010
right way to do things so we're going to

750
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,570
give them a little bit of power we want

751
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:33,370
to make sure that they're not going

752
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:36,189
rogue on us and you know going to the

753
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:37,600
dark side they're not all-powerful we

754
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:40,030
need to make sure that they understand

755
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:42,310
you're there to do the basic stuff and

756
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:45,160
the more I trust you the more authority

757
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:46,360
I'm going to give to you but understand

758
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:49,270
that there are places where you're going

759
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:50,530
to have to say above my paygrade outside

760
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:52,030
of my knowledge base please

761
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:54,010
he's come help me that is not a bad

762
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:57,879
thing want to make sure we give them

763
00:28:54,010 --> 00:29:00,010
that opportunity to do that so a good

764
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,420
goal for year one is to take over that

765
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:02,830
security grooming we provide on that

766
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:04,390
checklist it's going to be different

767
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:05,500
based on every team there's some basic

768
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:08,800
stuff in that it's going to look the

769
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:10,930
same we're going to want to do slow

770
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,430
deliberate mentoring with them we're

771
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:14,650
going to kind of transfer it to them

772
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:16,270
gradually and if you're really starting

773
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:17,590
out a program for the first time this is

774
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:21,840
where it's going to be painful for you

775
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:25,030
is giving them that that one-on-one time

776
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,379
we need them to know that there's again

777
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:28,389
in the toyota way they call the engine

778
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:30,340
cord right something broke I don't

779
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:31,930
understand it I'm going to stop stop

780
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:33,610
what's going on and have someone come in

781
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:35,800
they need to know that they need to call

782
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:37,959
us when it gets past what they're used

783
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:40,480
to past their comfort zone because the

784
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:43,450
costs of not doing that are huge for the

785
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:46,090
company and we're giving lots of

786
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:48,070
training that classroom time is the

787
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:49,570
beginning of it we have e-learning that

788
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:51,399
we put them through and we want to make

789
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:54,490
sure that they're doing it so we're

790
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:55,990
going to monitor that over time we're

791
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:59,140
going to measure them we're going to

792
00:29:55,990 --> 00:30:01,900
measure individuals and teams so from

793
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:03,880
the security champions portion we're

794
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:05,830
going to look at their code review

795
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,630
skills we're going to try to certify

796
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:09,699
them so we've created some certification

797
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:11,560
programs to say hey you're good at these

798
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:14,590
particular areas here's the parts where

799
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:16,030
you want to improve if you don't measure

800
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:17,500
it you're not going to improve it so

801
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:19,060
let's make sure that we're looking at

802
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:21,240
how good they are at what they're doing

803
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:22,810
so you need to do spot checks with that

804
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,920
especially on the people that have been

805
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:28,810
doing it a while it might get a little

806
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:31,570
lazy about it so goals for the team so

807
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:33,550
we looked at open Sam and B sim as

808
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:36,340
possible models for doing maturity

809
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:38,020
models for our application teams it

810
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:39,639
didn't really suit our needs it didn't

811
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:41,260
drive the behaviors that we wanted so we

812
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:43,260
kind of created our own custom one and

813
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:45,400
I've created lots of different security

814
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:48,190
maturity models for different companies

815
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:50,200
to drive certain behaviors so we create

816
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:51,970
our own and we've asked the teams to go

817
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,860
off and grade yourself tell me where you

818
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:56,110
are and your maturity curve and let's

819
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:57,250
talk about goals for getting better so

820
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:58,899
we'd love everyone to be up at a

821
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:01,570
maturity level five but we know we don't

822
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:03,350
start there and that's okay one of the

823
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:04,970
things that you know I'm a

824
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:07,219
soccer coach for a very long time I

825
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:08,840
always tell my kids the first day when

826
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:11,330
they just meet me is like look you don't

827
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:12,709
have to be bad to get better when I'm

828
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:14,299
giving you instruction when I'm

829
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:15,440
correcting things it's not because I

830
00:31:14,299 --> 00:31:17,270
think you're terrible is because I think

831
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,309
you have you have skills and

832
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:21,350
possibilities and I want to help you get

833
00:31:19,309 --> 00:31:22,820
to those so we're going to baseline

834
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:24,949
we're going to update that I think that

835
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:26,780
like every quarter is probably a good

836
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:28,520
cadence for that to understand are your

837
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:30,470
team's getting better or not this is

838
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,539
kind of where you become responsible for

839
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:34,250
this so if you think about application

840
00:31:32,539 --> 00:31:36,650
security there's the preventive stuff

841
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:39,380
that we do which happens before check-in

842
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:40,850
right so am I using the right tools am i

843
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:44,059
following the right process do I have

844
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:46,699
the right controls in place do I

845
00:31:44,059 --> 00:31:49,250
understand the the things that I'm

846
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:50,929
supposed to have before I'm done so

847
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:52,700
again we want to try to secure before

848
00:31:50,929 --> 00:31:54,049
that that's my preventive and then

849
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,940
everything that happens after that so if

850
00:31:54,049 --> 00:31:57,408
I do static analysis and dynamic

851
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:59,480
analysis and pen testing those are all

852
00:31:57,409 --> 00:32:00,650
assurance those help me sleep at night

853
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:05,090
to know that my teams are doing the

854
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:06,380
right thing right make sure you

855
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,820
understand what you're expecting out of

856
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:11,570
your teams and you're getting that give

857
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:14,389
them solid measures clear goals and and

858
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:18,379
help them along that path we need to

859
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:19,970
reward them to training opportunities it

860
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:23,179
might be they come give a talkative

861
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:25,309
b-sides or they go attend to b-sides or

862
00:32:23,179 --> 00:32:28,190
some security InfoSec conference or what

863
00:32:25,309 --> 00:32:30,289
have you that's kind of their reward for

864
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:34,940
doing the security stuff as they get new

865
00:32:30,289 --> 00:32:36,350
training get exposed to new ideas teach

866
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:38,539
them the hack so we talked about doing

867
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:40,639
those capture-the-flag activities this

868
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:42,470
really were engineer stuck light up

869
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,030
right I'm a problem solver I love to

870
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:45,740
solve problems I love to understand

871
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:47,720
things when I see something happen that

872
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:50,059
I don't get I want to delve deeper into

873
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:52,280
it so by having these kind of activities

874
00:32:50,059 --> 00:32:57,260
for them to do we're kind of stimulating

875
00:32:52,280 --> 00:33:00,620
their brains swag is always good I was

876
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:03,799
at a healthcare customer this past week

877
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:05,959
that gave out water bottles with their

878
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:08,900
their logo their application security

879
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:10,490
logo on it again swag is engineers love

880
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:13,580
free stuff they love free pizza they

881
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:15,940
love free clothing hats water bottles we

882
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,939
you know whatever

883
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:23,350
so it's also back on you guys so as we

884
00:33:20,649 --> 00:33:24,939
think about building out these security

885
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:26,678
champion teams this can't we can't be

886
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:29,259
like deaf to the things that they're

887
00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:32,200
challenged with right these teams face

888
00:33:29,259 --> 00:33:34,330
real challenges that we are not helping

889
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:36,549
with today so we've got to learn about

890
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:39,850
their world so reading who's read the

891
00:33:36,549 --> 00:33:41,168
Phoenix project excellent good anyone

892
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:43,480
that hasn't it should be on your reading

893
00:33:41,169 --> 00:33:45,870
list it's really short read it's a you

894
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:49,000
know it's a kind of funny little story

895
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:51,428
it's a quick read for you it will help

896
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
you understand this DevOps problem this

897
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:54,940
DevOps

898
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,500
solution the DevOps handbook is the next

899
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:59,110
one and there's actually for real some

900
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:00,519
security stuff in there I don't agree

901
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:02,529
with it all I don't think it goes far

902
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:04,710
enough but you know it's in the right

903
00:34:02,529 --> 00:34:06,970
direction

904
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:08,980
go to your scrum teams attend some

905
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:11,129
ceremonies so there are things in scrum

906
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:13,418
called you're either a chicken or a pig

907
00:34:11,129 --> 00:34:14,529
all right so the chickens don't talk you

908
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:16,690
come into the ceremony you could just

909
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:18,550
watch what's going on I encourage you to

910
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:20,290
do that go into those ceremonies and

911
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:21,550
just stand there and watch what goes on

912
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:23,349
watch the things that they live with

913
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:24,730
every day they're different that the

914
00:34:23,349 --> 00:34:26,260
things that you live with and the more

915
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:28,418
that you're compassionate about the

916
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:31,560
problems that they face the more of an

917
00:34:28,418 --> 00:34:34,060
ally you're seen as learn their tools

918
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:36,790
maybe you should be in you know github

919
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:39,549
who does security and does coding at the

920
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:42,250
same time so understanding those tool

921
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:44,919
chains understanding CI type servers and

922
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:45,879
Jenkins and and bug tracking systems and

923
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:48,399
all those things and all those

924
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:53,469
integrations play out using their ID

925
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:55,779
ease rote unless all right so I found my

926
00:34:53,469 --> 00:34:58,720
first error on my own right security

927
00:34:55,780 --> 00:35:00,250
stories help your team by actually

928
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,290
living that life so a lot of the

929
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:05,560
security guys at our company actually

930
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:07,960
are certified product owners what makes

931
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:10,089
a good story for an agile team and by

932
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:12,339
the way I keep mixing going back and

933
00:35:10,089 --> 00:35:14,759
forth between agile and DevOps usually

934
00:35:12,339 --> 00:35:16,869
DevOps is run on an agile methodology

935
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:19,210
because we think differently about what

936
00:35:16,869 --> 00:35:21,280
the cadence of release is between those

937
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:24,460
two but the methodology is usually an

938
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:27,730
agile one so write some security stories

939
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:29,540
code try to do this stuff see how hard

940
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:31,130
it is because it's not easy

941
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:33,230
your job isn't easy for the developer

942
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:37,670
and if you try to do theirs you'll find

943
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:39,350
the same thing all right so you don't

944
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:41,330
have to customize this this isn't like a

945
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:42,740
one-size-fits-all program where you can

946
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:43,970
say hey this is the way we're going to

947
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:45,529
do it this is what I saw on the slide

948
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:47,480
deck you have to think about your own

949
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:50,780
culture a lot of times when I go in and

950
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:52,460
talk about AB SEC programs you know one

951
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:54,350
of the biggest gaps is usually mandate

952
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:56,270
right so the reason they get to drive

953
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:58,130
around the gate that we saw before is

954
00:35:56,270 --> 00:36:00,440
because there isn't a strong mandate

955
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:03,370
from the development side of Alex you

956
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:05,330
don't have backing from the VP's the CIO

957
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:06,799
it's one of the critical things to

958
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:08,060
giving a successful app SEC programs

959
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,830
that have the developers actually be

960
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:11,660
measured on this so getting these things

961
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:14,240
in their goals and have it affect their

962
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:15,730
salary is a key to getting them to do

963
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:19,669
the right make the right behavior

964
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:22,960
modifications again empathy their job is

965
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:25,670
hard to they face different challenges

966
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:27,140
you should be in those teams looking at

967
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:30,740
them trying to live that life trying to

968
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:33,470
understand it a little bit better over

969
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:35,029
communicate so this reporting that we

970
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:37,910
talked about of you know where we are

971
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:39,860
from maturity model standpoint how good

972
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:42,140
your teams are how good your security

973
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:43,700
champions are you want to make sure that

974
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:45,440
you're you're constantly communicating

975
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:47,810
about security in a way that is friendly

976
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:50,570
to those development teams and this is a

977
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:52,580
critical one be extremely responsive

978
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:54,650
it's going to a lot of your time to

979
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:56,240
build this program and they don't want

980
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:57,680
to feel like you let them on the islands

981
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,790
like okay are in charge of security see

982
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,620
you later I got other stuff to do

983
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:03,410
eventually you get to move from the

984
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:05,180
tactical of the strategic but you need

985
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:06,799
to start with the tactical you need to

986
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:09,890
train these people up you need to have

987
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,420
some level of trust in them such that

988
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:13,370
you can let them go and say all right

989
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:14,900
you are now responsible for this much

990
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:16,250
anything over this please call me and

991
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:22,070
when they call you got to pick up the

992
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:24,140
phone you have to be there for them stay

993
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:26,480
engaged with this program right those

994
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:28,009
capture the flag exercises it may seem

995
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,830
like Drudge work to you yes I've already

996
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:33,460
done this one or I built this one years

997
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:36,650
ago but it's new to these guys be

998
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:37,910
incredibly engaged with them go out to

999
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:42,720
lunch with them take them on little team

1000
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:44,520
trips sometimes that team-building so in

1001
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,529
in some companies they call them guilds

1002
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,730
so usually an agile team wants to have

1003
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,990
all the people that need to do

1004
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:51,060
everything so I'll get development and

1005
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:53,490
security and quality and operations and

1006
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:55,529
stuff but those teams then cross

1007
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:57,118
pollinate other teams so the the guy

1008
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:58,500
that loves security will get together

1009
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:00,540
with the other ones like birds of a

1010
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:03,000
feather type engagements it will build

1011
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:04,349
these guilds build that teamwork so

1012
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:09,060
they're working with each other

1013
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:13,140
maybe mentoring each other alright

1014
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:22,609
anybody have any questions I do for time

1015
00:38:13,140 --> 00:39:05,098
shorter than I thought yes more towards

1016
00:38:22,609 --> 00:39:07,259
okay right so most of the time it's

1017
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:10,680
above your pay grade as was pointed out

1018
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:13,380
right all of this stuff is is risk

1019
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:14,848
versus reward right so these end of the

1020
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:17,040
quarter things are into the year type

1021
00:39:14,849 --> 00:39:18,900
things yeah I've seen a lot of those you

1022
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:21,779
need to make that strong case if you

1023
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:24,990
have better information so if we know

1024
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:26,609
that Apache Commons is or let's take the

1025
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:28,560
struts vulnerability which was under

1026
00:39:26,609 --> 00:39:30,690
active attack the second it was launched

1027
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,460
if we start showing them the landscape

1028
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:33,780
and the in the surface area that's being

1029
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:35,700
attacked and helped them understand

1030
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:37,260
exactly what could happen put a little

1031
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,430
bit of the fear of God into them they're

1032
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:40,500
going to think differently about saying

1033
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:41,940
no no we got to have stability here like

1034
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,950
no we're kind of get breached if we

1035
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:45,300
don't fix this stuff you need to build

1036
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:47,160
that case and understand that you're not

1037
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:49,170
always going to win right so you need to

1038
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:50,848
come there with your security champions

1039
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:52,349
behind you that are more Pat that are

1040
00:39:50,849 --> 00:39:54,780
passionate about like you are so if you

1041
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:55,950
you build that army of people they're

1042
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:57,990
going to be in that room saying no

1043
00:39:55,950 --> 00:40:00,750
really I need to fix this and we need to

1044
00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:02,549
fix it now so it's about building up and

1045
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:04,349
having enough data it's like well I

1046
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:06,480
think we're vulnerable though I know

1047
00:40:04,349 --> 00:40:08,490
we're vulnerable in across our landscape

1048
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:14,089
50% of our applications are in risk of

1049
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:14,089
breach right now what else yes sir

1050
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:50,859
right so what so what I was pointing out

1051
00:40:49,329 --> 00:40:53,470
is is what I see in most organizations

1052
00:40:50,859 --> 00:40:55,328
there are organizations that do it well

1053
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:56,890
that understand how to bake that into

1054
00:40:55,329 --> 00:40:58,420
stories that might not be a place where

1055
00:40:56,890 --> 00:41:01,029
we need a security champions program

1056
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:03,249
it's the people it's like one InfoSec

1057
00:41:01,029 --> 00:41:04,329
guy that has a little tiny bit of stuff

1058
00:41:03,249 --> 00:41:05,379
that they're supposed to do around AB

1059
00:41:04,329 --> 00:41:07,089
SEC with everything else they're

1060
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:10,269
supposed to do that needs to go out and

1061
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:11,769
build this this this army to go help

1062
00:41:10,269 --> 00:41:14,258
them get this job done because they

1063
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:16,990
can't attend in the case of hundreds of

1064
00:41:14,259 --> 00:41:21,369
teams all of the grooming ceremonies and

1065
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:23,439
make sure that security is there it is

1066
00:41:21,369 --> 00:41:25,059
and that's where we want it we want it

1067
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,410
baked in there what I've shown you is

1068
00:41:25,059 --> 00:41:34,109
the reality of what I see at most

1069
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:34,109
companies anyway else all right
