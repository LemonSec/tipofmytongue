digital defense and we're going to I'm

4
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:16,529
going to share an info sec talk in the

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:20,070
form of a murder mystery okay

6
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:21,119

00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:33,440
Canada so not far from here I know that

11
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:36,030
Boston and Montreal are very you know

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,230
head-to-head in terms of hockey just by

13
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,550
the way I saw the Montreal Canadiens

14
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,739
beat the Rangers yesterday was

15
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:44,519
incredible game just want to brag about

16
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:47,218
that this is a great weekend and was on

17
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,800
the plane so I live in San Antonio I was

18
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:53,730
on the plane coming here I guess it was

19
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:55,500
Friday and so many runners were on and

20
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,940
I'm gonna runner lots of runners were

21
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,770
you know on the plane I'm like what is

22
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,190
going on is it really the Boston

23
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,379
Marathon

24
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,059
of course I googled and there was so

25
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:04,438
great weekend I'm not going to be

26
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:06,929
running in it because I'm going to be

27
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:09,360
drinking later on so come join me anyway

28
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,340
yes I'm from Montreal Canada I grew up

29
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,780
there I went to McGill University so

30
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:18,990
kind of friends with Harvard sort of and

31
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:21,500
I started working in sama I graduated in

32
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:24,060
Computer Engineering I started working

33
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:27,390
started my career at Bell north and

34
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:29,460
research Nortel doing software

35
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:33,000
engineering software development for

36
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:35,699
switching telephone and telephony and it

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,040
was great and I thought hey if I'm going

38
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,840
to do this where's all the action and

39
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,270
all the telecom action at the time was

40
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,000
happening in Dallas Texas in the telecom

41
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:48,530
corridor so I moved my family in myself

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,770
of course to to Texas to Dallas Texas in

43
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:54,090
very very late 1995 just after Christmas

44
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:56,579
started working I think it was like

45
00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:01,409
January second or third I can't quite

46
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:03,389
remember in 1996 and I you know did some

47
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:06,420
call processing call processing software

48
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:09,360
platform type software and stayed there

49
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,860
about seven years then telecom started

50
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,720
going downhill at the time sort of

51
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,810
gradually and I started looking for a

52
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,840
job I was being laid

53
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:18,550
I was given the heads-up and so anyway I

54
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,530
looked around and I found this

55
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:22,240
cybersecurity Internet company called

56
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:26,760
digital defense and that's where I still

57
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:29,590
work I started there in November of 2002

58
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,209
I didn't know much about Internet

59
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:33,220
security at the time I knew a little bit

60
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:36,010
but they brought me on board made me for

61
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:37,990
my software architecture skills and I

62
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:40,329
learned off through osmosis you know

63
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:42,610
security my work with a bunch of pen

64
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:44,650
testers who drink redbull and hack into

65
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,970
banks and stuff and get paid to do that

66
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:49,930
I don't know what they do on their off

67
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:51,660
time but anyway so they brought me on

68
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:54,370
board to help reaaargh attacked a

69
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:56,020
vulnerability management system so

70
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:58,540
digital defense we offer vulnerability

71
00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:01,120
management system much like you know

72
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:03,280
Jack was talking about you know some of

73
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:07,300
the three like tenable rapid7 you know

74
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:09,130
Qualis tripwire digital defense we offer

75
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:11,709
a vulnerability management system we

76
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:14,799
architected it ourselves we have three

77
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:16,510
patents on it already so we're one of

78
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,140
the best-kept secrets in that area and

79
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:22,060
so when I came on board way back in 2002

80
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,500
I remember I started working you know it

81
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,540
started really Viktor me right into it

82
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:29,320
right away and I started working on the

83
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:31,390
existing system which was very immature

84
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,850
if you will was not in tiered it was

85
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:35,708
like you know essentially you had you

86
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:37,180
had database code right in the web and

87
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:40,120
you know it's kind of like two-tiered I

88
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:42,280
guess and there was an issue that I

89
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:45,640
started learning about and that's the

90
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:48,760
basis of this talk and so we came up

91
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:51,130
with a solution for this when we

92
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:54,100
reaaargh affected it approximately 2004

93
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:55,720
was the second incarnation now we're in

94
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,370
our sixth incarnation of this

95
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,540
vulnerability management system and the

96
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,430
solution that I'm going to talk about

97
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:03,630
here or the problem that I'm going to

98
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:06,850
talk about is solved in that incarnation

99
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:09,549
so anyway let's move on and let's get to

100
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:11,320
this so as far as an overview I'm going

101
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:14,350
to go over a little bit about clue right

102
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:17,349
because this talk models clue right so

103
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:18,700
this problem that I'm referring to I'm

104
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:21,310
not going to tell you about it up front

105
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:23,110
I'm going to step-by-step walk you

106
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:25,510
through it and I'm going to encourage

107
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:27,070
you and invite you to you know if you

108
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,539
figure out what this issue

109
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:30,610
you is that I'm referring to you can

110
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,810
raise your hand and say hey mordenite I

111
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:34,390
think I know what it is you can shout it

112
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:38,020
out and I don't have a price to give you

113
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:40,960
if you win but you recognition right so

114
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:41,979
recognition is almost as good so meager

115
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,299
mission we're going to talk about clue a

116
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,770
little bit we're going to go over a

117
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:49,600
crime scene we're going to talk about

118
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:50,740
what I call detective tools moment we're

119
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,300
going to talk about vulnerability

120
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,730
management background because there's a

121
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:57,460
specific scanning methodology that this

122
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:59,050
problem is related to and we're going to

123
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:03,070
talk about circumstantial evidence I

124
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:04,950
will then reveal whodunit so so that's

125
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:07,750
maybe 3/4 way through the presentation

126
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:10,659
talk about the victims the consequences

127
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:14,470
and avoiding future crimes okay great

128
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:15,060
this is the clue board does this look

129
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:17,890
familiar

130
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:20,650
great so clue is a game where you have

131
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:25,090
nine rooms so the ballroom conservatory

132
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:26,859
etc study room you have a set of cards

133
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:29,919
actually you kind of see them in the

134
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:31,780
corner up there I guess that's what

135
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,060
these are right here that's kind of cool

136
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:38,469
these are rooms right so these are the

137
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:40,990
rooms you also have six weapons the

138
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:45,370
knife the lead pipe the candlestick etc

139
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:46,930
and you have six suspects which are

140
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:48,490
represented by the little playing toque

141
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,020
is the little colored player in tokens

142
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:54,580
that you see here that's mrs. peacock

143
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:57,340
here she is okay missus garnet one of my

144
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:59,950
favorite characters here she is right

145
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:02,770
and so what happens is each player rolls

146
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:05,620
a dice up to six players can play you

147
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:08,950
move around the squares and you enter a

148
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:11,890
room right let me take a step back first

149
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:14,670
prior to prior to all that the very

150
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:17,830
beginning of the game one of the players

151
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:19,990
turns turns this set of weapons around

152
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:23,950
shuffles them up right and then pulls

153
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:26,380
out one that's the weapon that the

154
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:28,300
suspect use it uses to commit the crime

155
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:30,310
right so there's a crime that happen in

156
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,960
clue and you had to deduce who had

157
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:34,840
committed it with what weapon and in

158
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:37,770
what room so with the suspects you know

159
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:39,390
the person shuffles them up takes one Oh

160
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:43,830
places the cards

161
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:46,620
there similarly with with the rooms take

162
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:48,570
one out and place the rest in there now

163
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,490
the person then shuffles up the

164
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:53,520
remainder of the cards and distributes

165
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:55,950
them to the players okay so now you have

166
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,500
a set of cards in your hand and you're

167
00:06:55,950 --> 00:07:00,990
rolling a dice and you're going around

168
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:03,020
you enter a room each player when they

169
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:05,730
enter a room can make a suggestion and

170
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:08,520
the suggestion is I suggest as an

171
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:11,280
example I suggest that mrs. peacock

172
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:13,289
committed the murder with the rope in

173
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,489
the billiard room so you have to suggest

174
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:19,590
the room that you enter in right now

175
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:22,380
what happens is the player to year I

176
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:25,409
believe it's left if they have one of

177
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:26,370
these cards in their hands the path if

178
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,930
they have one of these cards if they

179
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:30,030
have the billiard room or the rope or

180
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:33,030
mrs. peacock then they can choose to

181
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:34,770
show you whichever one that is okay so

182
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:37,919
it's mrs. peacock so mrs. peacock of

183
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:40,680
course didn't do it one of the things I

184
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,850
forgot to mention is at the very

185
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,720
beginning of the game when you shuffle

186
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:47,460
up the actual crime scene a player puts

187
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,970
it in the sort of envelope and that's

188
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:53,370
what that envelope is that you see there

189
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:55,920
top right here right so just blowing it

190
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:59,040
up a little bit there it is it's placed

191
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:01,020
in the middle okay so that's so your

192
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,370
goal is to guess what that is and that's

193
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,229
what we're going to do as we walk

194
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:06,380
through this presentation so we're going

195
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:08,820
to talk about information crime scene

196
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:13,020
what is this scene that we're going to

197
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:16,380
talk about okay well you know in the

198
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:18,030
olden days or quite some time ago when

199
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,469
security was a lot younger and I was a

200
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:23,280
little younger as well than you were as

201
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:24,960
well the different security technologies

202
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,419
mainly operated within their own

203
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,599
security silo maybe with the with the

204
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:32,789
exception of sin but essentially

205
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:35,760
vulnerability management you know had

206
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:37,289
technology and processes and it didn't

207
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,429
share that information with other

208
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:43,020
technologies

209
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:44,609
similarly DLP etc right and then we

210
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:48,090
started to get smarter and we started to

211
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:49,710
say hey if we want to solve sort of more

212
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:52,320
advanced and maybe not even that

213
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:52,990
advanced use cases we need to we need to

214
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,610
talk to each other

215
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:57,700
we need to take this information from

216
00:08:54,610 --> 00:09:00,040
the various systems from the various

217
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:03,899
systems or going to go back and share it

218
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:08,949
and so what I did is I map these various

219
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:10,510
technologies like I am is mr. green

220
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:15,420
miss Carter this vulnerability

221
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:17,649
management etc one of these one of these

222
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:19,719
technologies is actually sharing

223
00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:22,990
poisonous data this is the crime scene

224
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:25,870
is actually sharing poisonous data into

225
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:28,930
your security ecosystem and not only is

226
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:31,690
it polluting its own silo but it's

227
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:33,040
polluting you know these security

228
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:35,230
technologies that it shares information

229
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,000
with so that in the middle is your sis

230
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:38,740
Oh drinking poison as a result of it

231
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,370
that's sort of a side effect

232
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:47,260
unfortunately so let's take a step back

233
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:50,080
and talk about a security use case it's

234
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:52,810
a hypothetical use case but it actually

235
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:56,110
could be very real so sort of set the

236
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:57,910
stage so now please don't go over here

237
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:59,560
out of this room and say hey Gordon just

238
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:01,089
revealed a zero-day because that's not

239
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:06,219
the case it's a hypothetical use case

240
00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:08,380
right but imagine imagine that we had

241
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:10,750
just been you know just today has been

242
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:13,990
revealed the fact that the apache web

243
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:15,430
server for specific versions right so

244
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:19,149
for versions two point four point zero

245
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:22,989
to two point four point two four there

246
00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:25,149
is a serious vulnerability but it's not

247
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:27,190
impacting the most recent release of two

248
00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:29,950
point four point two five it's fixed in

249
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:32,950
that one magically okay what would you

250
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:35,950
do as a security professional to sort of

251
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:37,060
gauge your risk across your network well

252
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:39,070
you'd probably want to consult your

253
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,969
vulnerability assessments right

254
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,649
hopefully you have a vulnerability

255
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:43,990
assessment program vulnerability

256
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:48,010
management program you consult those or

257
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:50,050
even better you would launch a more

258
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:52,600
recent scan right maybe even today

259
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:56,770
across your entire network to determine

260
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:59,529
ok which of my which of my network

261
00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:02,380
elements actually is running Apache at

262
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:04,630
the vulnerable versions so I'm showing

263
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:06,820
this network diagram here right a very

264
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:09,550
small one where the red dot represents

265
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:12,310
a vulnerable instance of Apache so

266
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:14,170
there's only one here today and you'd be

267
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:16,479
you know a lot of security professionals

268
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:19,060
would say that's enough to know that

269
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,980
I'll now just you know prioritize this

270
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:22,089
amongst all my other vulnerabilities and

271
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,830
throw it into my vulnerability

272
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:29,800
management program and off to the races

273
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:31,680
I go and I'm happy but if you know if

274
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:34,870
you think about it a little bit more

275
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,400
it's very possible that although today

276
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:40,510
we know about this zero day

277
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:41,230
hypothetically the bad guys and bad

278
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:44,319
girls

279
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:46,810
for example the hackers might have known

280
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,970
about this for quite some time and they

281
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:50,410
perhaps might have even compromised this

282
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:52,300
without even knowing it maybe they got

283
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:54,969
past their incident response program if

284
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:56,740
that makes sense so what you do in

285
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:58,780
addition to you know looking at the

286
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:02,800
present is you'd look in the past you'd

287
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:05,380
say hey where perhaps was I vulnerable

288
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,810
in the past where today I'm not how

289
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:09,460
could that happen well maybe maybe you

290
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,349
know maybe you used to have an Apache

291
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:14,050
that system that was vulnerable it was

292
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:15,340
installed here in the past but you'd be

293
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,839
installed that you didn't need it on

294
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:19,090
that server anymore or perhaps you

295
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:21,220
upgraded to the two point four point two

296
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:22,630
five and you're not vulnerable so it's

297
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:25,720
possible that you were vulnerable in the

298
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:27,370
past but not necessary today so this

299
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,170
diagram is showing one instance of

300
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:30,940
vulnerable which is there in the past

301
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:33,540
but two that were in the past that is

302
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:35,740
not in the present if that makes sense

303
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:38,410
you can take that what I call

304
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:40,090
vulnerability intelligence feed an into

305
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:43,000
your incident response program as

306
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:44,800
candidates for nodes that are perhaps

307
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,930
already compromised not to say that they

308
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:50,040
are but they might be okay it's just

309
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:52,079
extra information so that's pretty cool

310
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:54,550
so here's where I'm showing

311
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,130
vulnerability management and this is at

312
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:58,569
the stage now you're playing clue and

313
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:59,980
you discovered through the process of

314
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,450
elimination going through the board and

315
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:05,970
you look at your cards Wow

316
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:08,800
I know that Miss Scarlet is the actual

317
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:10,420
the actual murderer if that makes sense

318
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,979
you may not know what room it's in you

319
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,550
don't know what weapon but you know it's

320
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,440
Miss Scarlet

321
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:16,240
so you're proceeding on so this is the

322
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:20,140
situation where vulnerability management

323
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:22,720
is feeding poisonous information

324
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:26,470
to incident response something's gone

325
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,910
wrong okay so in other words in the

326
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:29,440
previous diagram where I showed three

327
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,980
candidates three candidates are being

328
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,630
shared

329
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:33,940
perhaps there's actually more than the

330
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:35,500
three candidates but but we didn't feed

331
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:37,090
the right information pins in response

332
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,820
so there's some challenge within

333
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:42,340
vulnerability management where the data

334
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:45,630
that we're sharing isn't perfect if that

335
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:48,070
makes sense okay so let's explore more

336
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:50,470
so this is where we take a step back I

337
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:52,900
put this on the board because on my next

338
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:54,340
diagram I talked about time and every

339
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:56,709
time I think about that I think about

340
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:58,570
you know pretty Marty right so we're

341
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:00,160
Doc's on the board and in Back to the

342
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:02,950
Future - this is back to the future - by

343
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:05,890
the way if you've seen it so I used

344
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:07,870
these sort of I guess diagrams I you

345
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:11,650
know kind of fantasized about myself on

346
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:14,260
the board just like Doc and so to share

347
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:15,970
a little bit more about this issue this

348
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:18,910
challenge that vulnerability management

349
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:20,350
vulnerability scanning has is the bottom

350
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:22,600
part of the diagram that I'm showing

351
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:24,460
here represents the real-world assets

352
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,470
right the computers that you can touch

353
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:29,650
even if they're virtual you know they're

354
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:33,520
there right whereas the top part of the

355
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:37,420
diagram illustrates two different point

356
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:39,040
in time scans these are right so within

357
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,240
vulnerability management you're not just

358
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,770
doing one scan at one point in time and

359
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,750
finding the vulnerabilities and saying

360
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:46,329
I'm done let me go patch never again

361
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:49,390
look at it it's a process where you're

362
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:51,490
doing this at regular intervals to

363
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:53,500
understand all new vulnerabilities came

364
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:55,540
out or what did I fix did I really fix

365
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,910
it let me verify that so you're actually

366
00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:00,250
doing vulnerability scans at multiple

367
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:03,490
points in time well one of the

368
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:05,170
challenges is how does the vulnerability

369
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:07,150
management system not necessarily the

370
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:09,599
scanners but the vulnerability

371
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:13,420
management system how does it know that

372
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:16,540
a given asset that's been scanned at one

373
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:18,339
point in time is the same as its correct

374
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:20,680
counterpart as scanned at a different

375
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:22,330
point in time so that's important in

376
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,939
order to satisfy our use case in many

377
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:27,450
other use cases it needs to be able to

378
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:31,090
do this okay if that makes sense

379
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:31,620
question is how does it do this right so

380
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:33,210
to

381
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:34,770
understand that let's look a little more

382
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:38,420
into vulnerability management

383
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:41,610
vulnerability scanning technologies I

384
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:43,079
mapped the different weapons of clue to

385
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:45,330
these and I'll explain that in a second

386
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:48,390
but first let me explain these different

387
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:50,010
technologies so there are different

388
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:52,250
scanning technologies and vulnerability

389
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:55,110
scanning land that we all use

390
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:57,060
there's agent-based which is up here

391
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:59,490
there's passive scanning not all vendors

392
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:00,890
do that but some do it's not up here but

393
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:03,180
it falls into one of these categories

394
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:04,980
there's what I call remote

395
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:07,109
unauthenticated based scanning or

396
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:09,900
network scanning and then credential

397
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:10,910
base or privilege based so when

398
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,930
asian-based

399
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:15,890
represented by the Rope because it's

400
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:19,949
tied to it so there's sort of a relation

401
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:21,630
this is where essentially you'll have

402
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:25,320
your your vulnerability management

403
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:27,390
system which perhaps is not necessarily

404
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,490
on you know on your computer and you'll

405
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:31,560
have agents that are on the computers

406
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:33,779
they're actually programs that are on

407
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:35,099
the computers that you want to scan so

408
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:36,930
you have to deploy them somehow

409
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:39,390
sometimes that's not hard but sometimes

410
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:42,060
it's not that easy right and so when you

411
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:44,189
run a scan the centralized vulnerability

412
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:46,560
management system interfaces with that

413
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:48,900
program and says go launch your scan and

414
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,819
the scan is actually running on the

415
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:52,800
computer if that makes sense it's right

416
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:54,720
on it so it's very accurate because it's

417
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:58,170
present on it you can get all the files

418
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:00,630
all the registry Keys lots more so

419
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:04,199
that's the engine based remote

420
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:06,990
unauthenticated in this case the scanner

421
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:10,170
has no presence at all on the host that

422
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:12,449
it's scanning its remote and it will

423
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:14,400
send internet messages to those nodes

424
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:17,730
that it's scanning and based upon the

425
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,800
responses it'll determine well first of

426
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:21,540
all is there even a computer there at

427
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:24,419
the IP address space that I may be

428
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:26,639
scanning what ports are open what

429
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:30,270
services are there what applications are

430
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,470
present for example Apache what what

431
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:33,300
vulnerabilities exist

432
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:34,920
finally right so that's remote

433
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:37,200
unauthenticated based scanning or

434
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:39,960
network based credential based scanning

435
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:43,820
is sort of a mixture of the two the

436
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:45,480
scanning intelligence is remote but

437
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:48,149
essentially what you do is you

438
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,490
go into your your IT system you set up a

439
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:52,440
set of credentials for your various

440
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:54,450
nodes that you want to use privilege

441
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,190
scanning with you enter the

442
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:58,980
vulnerability management system and you

443
00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:02,340
provision those credentials and then the

444
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:04,620
vulnerability scanner will authenticate

445
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:06,750
to the various nodes and then it can get

446
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:09,780
information such as registry keys files

447
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:11,790
etc and draw conclusions it may even be

448
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:14,549
able to or can depending upon the

449
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:16,980
credentials drop what we call a

450
00:18:14,549 --> 00:18:18,900
dissolvable agent or which is a program

451
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:20,340
on the computer so in that sense it's

452
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:24,690
very very similar to agent based

453
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:28,500
scanning okay so it's very you know very

454
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:30,270
deep but there are challenges or

455
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,130
overhead challenges IP overhead

456
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:33,090
challenges to actually perform it in

457
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:35,370
other words you have to create

458
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:36,899
credentials you have to maintain those

459
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:38,939
credentials you don't want them to have

460
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,679
too much power you may not want them to

461
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:42,540
live forever maybe you just want to

462
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:44,190
manage it and you know sort of in such a

463
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:46,530
way that okay I'm just about to launch a

464
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:48,030
scan let's let's enable it so there's

465
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:50,668
some overhead involved if you want to do

466
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:54,090
it right okay so let's take a step back

467
00:18:50,669 --> 00:18:55,710
now most organizations enders first of

468
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:58,409
all most vulnerability management

469
00:18:55,710 --> 00:19:00,270
vendors will offer their certainly

470
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:03,799
offers the remote an authenticated one

471
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:06,750
they may or may not offer agent-based

472
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:08,309
and they typically will offer credential

473
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:10,100
based so they're going to offer two two

474
00:19:08,309 --> 00:19:12,780
things maybe three maybe even four

475
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:15,178
passive is in there as well and

476
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:18,330
essentially the way that clients will

477
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:20,130
use use the technology is because

478
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:22,939
unauthenticated or network based

479
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:26,520
scanning is so it has such low overhead

480
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:28,679
and it's quite accurate even though it's

481
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:31,799
not necessarily on the node they'll set

482
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:35,100
up recurring scans may be monthly may be

483
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:37,379
weekly maybe even continuously to scan

484
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:40,379
these the entire network they'll cast

485
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:41,940
the wide net to get you know to kind of

486
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:44,070
get the risk and the information across

487
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:46,169
the entire network and then they'll use

488
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:49,110
agent based or credential base for

489
00:19:46,169 --> 00:19:51,750
certain situations we can talk a little

490
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:53,100
bit about more for example laptops where

491
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:55,590
you know you know you're actually doing

492
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:57,600
browsing and you have Adobe and you know

493
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,470
flash and those types of things there

494
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,159
are certain vulnerabilities that

495
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,750
authentic

496
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:03,000
it cannot detect because they actually

497
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:04,860
don't open ports to do so but yet

498
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,450
they're still remotely exploitable so if

499
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:08,879
I send you for example a word doc that

500
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:10,980
has a you know malicious payload

501
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,230
even though word isn't an application

502
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:14,970
that listens on the Internet you you may

503
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:16,790
still be compromised right so you'll use

504
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:18,900
credential based scanning to detect that

505
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:20,340
or for example if you know where your

506
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,710
credit card information is you have

507
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:24,959
nodes that or parts of the network which

508
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:27,120
have more risk you'll want to perhaps

509
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,790
get more information so you'll be

510
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,260
willing to spend more money to set up

511
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:34,260
credential based scanning or agent based

512
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:36,780
gaming if that makes sense now I tied

513
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:38,370
the candlestick to remote

514
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:40,649
unauthenticated based scanning because

515
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:42,780
the candlestick if you look at the

516
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:44,070
various weapons include the candlestick

517
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:46,560
is the only one that actually sheds

518
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:48,780
light or can shed light I didn't have a

519
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:51,960
flashlight so if I did I would have used

520
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:53,730
it but so the candlestick sheds light

521
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:56,160
right so it's kind of like the scanner

522
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:58,230
sheds light on the nose that it's

523
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:00,600
scanning and based upon what it sees

524
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:04,740
remotely with that light it draws

525
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:10,980
conclusions okay so that makes sense so

526
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:13,980
great no it's at this point in time I

527
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:15,630
didn't tell you but the candlestick is

528
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,280
actually the weapon if you haven't

529
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:19,260
guessed it yet since I spend so much

530
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,450
time on it the candlestick is actually

531
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:23,010
the weapon that's being used here in

532
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:25,920
other words it's because of remote

533
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:28,470
network based unauthenticated scanning

534
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:30,720
that vulnerability management vendors

535
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:31,860
experienced this challenge that I'm

536
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,130
sharing with you today

537
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:38,760
which is the subject of our murder and

538
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:41,310
you may wonder a great specifically how

539
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:43,620
do Valle 'nor ability management vendors

540
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:47,040
the solution providers how do they

541
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:48,419
actually track the various endpoints

542
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,220
that remember that diagram that I shared

543
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:52,230
where you had two different scans how do

544
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:54,870
they track the assets I've seen at one

545
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:56,630
point to the correct counterparts as

546
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:59,580
seen as the other at the other point

547
00:21:56,630 --> 00:22:02,190
especially when we're talking about

548
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:03,659
remote unauthenticated scanning agent

549
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:05,220
base scanning credentialed a scanning

550
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:07,830
don't have that challenge and we can

551
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:08,460
talk about why but let's leave that to

552
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:11,340
the side for now

553
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,690
remote unauthenticated does have that

554
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:15,020
channel

555
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:16,820
and the reason is because if you look at

556
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,950
network characteristics for the various

557
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:20,419
elements that are on the internet

558
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:21,740
there's really nothing I mean there's

559
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:24,380
certain characteristics that you would

560
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:29,390
think are quite static but in reality

561
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:31,100
they may all change okay a lot of people

562
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:32,960
talk when when I present this or talk

563
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,550
about it they will say well what about

564
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,980
MAC address and I'm like yeah it's

565
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:39,110
pretty stable but the problem is unless

566
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:41,240
you're deploying scanners on every

567
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:43,939
single network segment or unless you're

568
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:47,120
talking about Windows you're not always

569
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:49,490
going to get the MAC address and so in

570
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,379
fact one of the largest vendors out

571
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:54,380
there doesn't use MAC address at all to

572
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:54,830
track and so you may wonder how do they

573
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,810
do it

574
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:58,520
what do they use well they use various

575
00:22:56,810 --> 00:23:00,889
characteristics such as IP address

576
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:05,120
various host names MAC address they do

577
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:09,320
use host types other things to actually

578
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:11,360
correctly match those things but most of

579
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:14,060
the vendors out there used only one or

580
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,520
two perhaps three so they're very

581
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:21,590
limited in those algorithms if that

582
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:22,940
makes sense actually this is this is one

583
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:24,050
of the very you know one of the top

584
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:26,750
mentors out there I'm not going to name

585
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:28,399
who this is what they they actually I'm

586
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:29,870
so I'm sharing with you one one of the

587
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,670
prevalent algorithms out there that

588
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:34,909
actually is used to solve this problem

589
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:36,380
and I call the algorithm and they call

590
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:38,420
it for example they call this this

591
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:40,490
problem host tracking so if you googled

592
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:42,020
host tracking you know what I really

593
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:43,490
meant event host tracking you'll figure

594
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:46,190
out who it is because I'm not banging on

595
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:47,990
anybody here I'm just saying this this

596
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:50,960
is you know this is real this is a real

597
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:53,030
problem and so they use what I call

598
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,630
single host tracking key admin user

599
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:57,950
specifies one of it's a very long name

600
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:59,660
I'm a software developer and I use very

601
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:01,820
long names in my variables as well and

602
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:06,140
everyone tells me what are you doing but

603
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:09,080
anyway I digress so they use one of I P

604
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:12,650
address DNS host name or NetBIOS hosting

605
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:14,389
in other words they will allow you to go

606
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:17,050
into the vulnerability management system

607
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:20,240
as you as the administrator and

608
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:24,100
provision this system in such a way that

609
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,100
you indicate how do you want

610
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:28,289
how do you want the vulnerability

611
00:24:25,529 --> 00:24:32,960
management system to track hosts across

612
00:24:28,289 --> 00:24:36,090
time from you know different scans and

613
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:38,279
you can specify well you know I know

614
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:40,019
that I had this this ranger this IP

615
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:42,389
address range in this range I know I

616
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:44,009
have laptops and it's using the HCP so

617
00:24:42,389 --> 00:24:46,320
I'm not going to use IP address that

618
00:24:44,009 --> 00:24:49,049
would be done I need something else let

619
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,879
me use NetBIOS oh but this this is a set

620
00:24:49,049 --> 00:24:52,440
of servers and this different IP address

621
00:24:50,879 --> 00:24:54,330
so you can do it by different ranges and

622
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:56,070
you can go in and say oh I want this

623
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:58,799
technique for this range this technique

624
00:24:56,070 --> 00:25:03,139
for that range etc and so that's how

625
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:07,168
they do it now is that good enough and

626
00:25:03,139 --> 00:25:08,939
the question and that's the question and

627
00:25:07,169 --> 00:25:11,700
to answer whether or not that's good

628
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:14,899
enough we really have to ask another

629
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:17,909
question and the other question is how

630
00:25:14,899 --> 00:25:21,539
often do these characteristics change in

631
00:25:17,909 --> 00:25:24,629
different IT environments so my team and

632
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:26,490
I actually did this study about a year

633
00:25:24,629 --> 00:25:29,699
and a half ago that's why we entered the

634
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:31,289
study room did this study to find out

635
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,240
and understand well how often do these

636
00:25:31,289 --> 00:25:35,429
things change and the reason we were

637
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,860
wondering about this is because we know

638
00:25:35,429 --> 00:25:39,600
that we spent you know we have we have

639
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:41,908
an algorithm which I'll share you know

640
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:45,178
in a little while to solve this problem

641
00:25:41,909 --> 00:25:46,409
and you know it uses pattern recognition

642
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:49,919
and things like that I kind of studied

643
00:25:46,409 --> 00:25:52,499
that you know my final Europe Gill and

644
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,570
so we're spending a lot of money a lot

645
00:25:52,499 --> 00:25:56,909
of money meaning it's special software

646
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:57,869
it's not like simple okay I'll just use

647
00:25:56,909 --> 00:25:59,669
this characteristic or that

648
00:25:57,869 --> 00:26:01,168
characteristic it's it's a lot more

649
00:25:59,669 --> 00:26:03,570
complex than that and when you have

650
00:26:01,169 --> 00:26:05,730
software that's semi complex you're

651
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:08,369
going to have maintenance as time goes

652
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:09,509
on more maintenance that if it's simple

653
00:26:08,369 --> 00:26:11,039
meaning you're going to have some bugs

654
00:26:09,509 --> 00:26:12,419
so you're going to have updates you're

655
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,259
going to have to make babysit it you're

656
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:15,840
going to have to you know you're going

657
00:26:13,259 --> 00:26:17,549
to have to it's not it's it be great if

658
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,889
you have an algorithm let's just perhaps

659
00:26:17,549 --> 00:26:22,139
possible it's hands off and it's very

660
00:26:19,889 --> 00:26:23,850
intelligent and uses analytics etc but

661
00:26:22,139 --> 00:26:24,779
that's that's not necessarily you know

662
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:26,908
how this works

663
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:28,320
and so we want to understand well

664
00:26:26,909 --> 00:26:31,470
whatever what are our competitors doing

665
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:33,990
and is it worth it is it worth it for us

666
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:36,720
to actually spend this extra time if in

667
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:37,850
fact IT environments are very static

668
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,289
because if they're very sad

669
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:42,439
we don't have to spend all that money if

670
00:26:39,289 --> 00:26:44,809
that makes sense so we did a study and

671
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:49,010
what we did is we looked across time and

672
00:26:44,809 --> 00:26:53,559
we subdivided this study into different

673
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:57,200
types of devices firewalls servers

674
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:58,730
laptops and desktops you know because

675
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,230
they're going to have different rates of

676
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:02,179
change if that makes sense based upon

677
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:04,669
different characteristics okay

678
00:27:02,179 --> 00:27:05,960
and so I'm showing you just a

679
00:27:04,669 --> 00:27:08,600
cross-section I'm showing you server

680
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:10,970
types host these are findings and client

681
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:13,250
type post clients meeting laptops and

682
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:14,840
desktops by the way here is a reference

683
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:16,309
I'm sure you could all read that I'll

684
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,480
make the slides available so that it's

685
00:27:16,309 --> 00:27:19,760
more easier we can go to my website

686
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:23,990
digital defense comm and just search on

687
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:26,390
resources and you'll find it anyway so

688
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:28,760
for server type host database servers

689
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:30,830
web servers etc application servers

690
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:32,600
where you would think that you know

691
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:35,149
there's they're not going to change that

692
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:37,459
much and it's true there's very low rate

693
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:39,409
of change but you know IP address which

694
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:40,610
is default actually on the previous

695
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:43,610
algorithm that I showed you for that

696
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:47,030
large vendor IP address actually changes

697
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:48,260
at four percent across three months so

698
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:52,280
if you look at a three month time period

699
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:53,750
if you have one server or let's say you

700
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,980
have a hundred thousand servers four

701
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:58,100
thousand of them are going to actually

702
00:27:54,980 --> 00:28:00,650
experience at least one change so we

703
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:03,918
counted one if we saw a change across

704
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:05,809
that three month and it compounds itself

705
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:08,870
so after another three months you're

706
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:10,639
going to see more more churn right so if

707
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:12,979
your algorithms are simplistic you're

708
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,490
going to get things wrong if that makes

709
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:15,890
sense

710
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:18,799
so you're probably getting a little

711
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:20,600
understanding of the crime here so

712
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:22,850
here's where I have a diagram actually

713
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:25,158
showing and a map so what I did is I map

714
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:29,299
the rooms to the different IP addresses

715
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:31,520
and so in this vulnerability management

716
00:28:29,299 --> 00:28:32,658
game that we're playing which is more

717
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,559
than just vulnerability management

718
00:28:32,659 --> 00:28:35,260
because we're taking the information

719
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:37,700
we're feeding it into our security

720
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:40,879
ecosystems in the form of integrations

721
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:43,340
right to solve different use cases this

722
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:46,280
game is actually more complex than clue

723
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:48,139
because include the murders the murder

724
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,970
happens or what's committed in one room

725
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:51,120
but in this game

726
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:52,590
the rooms change

727
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:56,639
right so it's actually multiple rooms

728
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:58,830
that make sense so that's that one

729
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,610
so whodunit reveal this is the point in

730
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:06,060
time where I reveal the whole story

731
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:09,030
probably guessed it by now but a it's

732
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:14,190
the candlestick which is the weapon Miss

733
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:15,899
Scarlet is the culprit and any room you

734
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:17,700
would have picked is cool because it

735
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:19,710
happens in many different rooms so the

736
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:22,860
reason is most widely used scanning

737
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:24,690
technology in environments not to say

738
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:26,070
that the other ones are not used but I

739
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:27,060
mean if you're using if you're doing

740
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:28,950
scanning and you're doing all

741
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:31,560
agent-based than the Bravo to you that's

742
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:33,510
great similarly with credential based

743
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:36,540
but most most if not all of our clients

744
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:39,390
actually are having troubles doing that

745
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:42,750
because it costs money and so they they

746
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:44,550
often use remote network unauthenticated

747
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:48,420
scanning but that comes with the

748
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:49,919
challenge and that challenge is solved

749
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:52,110
in different ways by different vendors

750
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:54,360
in fact that challenge isn't is it's not

751
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:55,979
at the forefront of your minds often

752
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,510
when I give this talk by the end of it

753
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:59,400
people people come up to me and they say

754
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:01,680
wow I didn't even realize that that was

755
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:03,330
a problem and you know it's kind of like

756
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:05,220
you just don't think about it you just

757
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:07,590
assume that it's there just matching

758
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:10,650
perfectly but that's not the case and in

759
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:12,629
fact most vendors use very simplistic

760
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:16,140
algorithms and I was a little surprised

761
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:18,600
at this and so that's the second point

762
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:21,630
and thirdly all remotely discoverable

763
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:23,459
characteristics derp subject to change

764
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:25,110
so IP address is subject to change

765
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:26,790
you know IT personnel they're not just

766
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:29,070
sitting around doing nothing they're you

767
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:30,360
know things things draw up printers drop

768
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:32,879
it I said I'll just change the IP

769
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:34,320
address and I'll inform the people you

770
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,330
know so they kind of get around that

771
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,040
problem but they're not thinking oh I

772
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:39,149
better I better not change these things

773
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:41,070
because the vulnerability management

774
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:42,810
system is using this tracking mechanism

775
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:43,889
to track it and all things are going to

776
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:45,600
break so that's not good

777
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:47,730
no they don't think that right you have

778
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,780
these different teams and so anyway

779
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:50,220
that's that's a big problem

780
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,780
so the real crime here is that

781
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:53,940
vulnerability management systems lacks

782
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:56,970
efficient what I call scan to scan

783
00:30:53,940 --> 00:31:00,930
endpoint correlation and the result is

784
00:30:56,970 --> 00:31:03,120
often they mistake a scanned asset at

785
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:04,740
one in one point in time to a different

786
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,178
one or they assume a

787
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:10,740
it must be a new asset I've never seen

788
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:13,230
this before so this is the sort of crime

789
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:15,690
revealed so I open up the envelope well

790
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:18,630
I almost forgot I have it here open it

791
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:21,300
up and I've got the candlestick

792
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:23,100
I got Miss Scarlet here obviously you

793
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:25,050
know that I shuffled them up sort of non

794
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:27,030
randomly so right and you got the roof

795
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:29,960
anyway for the purpose of the

796
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:32,870
presentation very good let's move on

797
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:36,390
consequences time check

798
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:38,280
we're doing good okay consequences

799
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:40,530
there's actually two different I mean

800
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:43,550
there's a lot of sub consequences wasted

801
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:47,010
money etc but the root cause or

802
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:48,570
consequences of this issue are that the

803
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:52,230
vulnerability management system that

804
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:55,139
you're using will often declare an asset

805
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:56,940
duplication in other words and we'll

806
00:31:55,140 --> 00:32:01,500
talk within the second or an asset

807
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:05,220
mismatch let's talk about asset mismatch

808
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:06,929
okay so here's an example there's this

809
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:10,530
diagram again this back to the future

810
00:32:06,929 --> 00:32:14,250
diagram okay here's your assets and over

811
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:16,440
here I scan in week one and I you know I

812
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:18,780
see three different hosts with various

813
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:20,730
different network characteristics this

814
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:25,678
is what the scanner is seeing at that

815
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:28,470
point in time time progresses now let's

816
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:30,540
assume that your IT operations team is

817
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:32,850
doing some work and something happened

818
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:34,710
and they made a change to these two

819
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:37,949
assets and for whatever reason they flip

820
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:39,929
the IP addresses okay this is sort of a

821
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:42,000
very simplified example but in this

822
00:32:39,929 --> 00:32:43,740
situation what happens is the

823
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,500
vulnerability management system if it's

824
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:48,240
using IP address for example that larger

825
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,559
vendor that I was talking about if if

826
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,300
you didn't know about this problem you

827
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:52,649
can go into the system it specify

828
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:55,290
anything it's going to be using the

829
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:57,300
default which is IP address and even if

830
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:59,879
it were servers maybe you'd want it to

831
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:01,200
be that way so anyway the system the

832
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:04,290
vulnerability management system will

833
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:06,450
believe that this asset is the same as

834
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:09,980
this one because they have the same IP

835
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:12,809
address well what's going to happen is

836
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:17,309
let's so for example take a step back

837
00:33:12,809 --> 00:33:18,539
let's assume that this red asset has you

838
00:33:17,309 --> 00:33:20,879
know a set of vulnerabilities

839
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:22,109
and the yellow asset has a completely

840
00:33:20,879 --> 00:33:25,109
different you know it's orthogonal

841
00:33:22,109 --> 00:33:26,099
nothing in common yeah sure they may

842
00:33:25,109 --> 00:33:27,689
that may both have high-level

843
00:33:26,099 --> 00:33:29,189
vulnerabilities etc but they have

844
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:33,059
nothing in common for the sake of

845
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:35,309
argument right so what happens is after

846
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:38,879
this scan the vulnerability management

847
00:33:35,309 --> 00:33:41,070
system will declare wow you fix all the

848
00:33:38,879 --> 00:33:43,738
vulnerabilities that were there before

849
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:46,468
for that red asset oh you got new ones

850
00:33:43,739 --> 00:33:47,879
now but that's okay you're always going

851
00:33:46,469 --> 00:33:50,279
to have new ones here and there but that

852
00:33:47,879 --> 00:33:52,498
good job you fix those but that's not

853
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:54,269
true the only reason it's declaring that

854
00:33:52,499 --> 00:33:56,159
is because it it encountered a mismatch

855
00:33:54,269 --> 00:33:58,139
I don't know if you've experienced this

856
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:00,209
but we've talked to you know lots of

857
00:33:58,139 --> 00:34:02,189
people not not necessarily our clients

858
00:34:00,209 --> 00:34:03,959
but prospects that have come to us and

859
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:06,089
you know or people come up to me after a

860
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:08,759
presentation early oh that's exactly the

861
00:34:06,089 --> 00:34:10,949
issue I'm experiencing thank you for

862
00:34:08,759 --> 00:34:14,460
highlighting that so that's that's

863
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:16,138
mismatch duplication which I don't have

864
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:19,259
a diagram for you but sort of

865
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:22,769
simplistically is a case where imagine

866
00:34:19,259 --> 00:34:27,119
that at this point in time or later you

867
00:34:22,768 --> 00:34:29,549
know so for example let's say here you

868
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,779
you you actually detected this issue you

869
00:34:29,549 --> 00:34:32,129
like wow wait a sec why is the

870
00:34:30,779 --> 00:34:33,899
vulnerability management system telling

871
00:34:32,129 --> 00:34:35,399
me that these things are fixed I know

872
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:37,589
they're still there and then you and

873
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:39,538
then you discover oh it's because okay

874
00:34:37,589 --> 00:34:41,159
let me go into the system and actually

875
00:34:39,539 --> 00:34:43,379
change this so that it no longer matches

876
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:47,309
an IP address but instead matches on

877
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:48,359
let's say oh I don't know well I guess

878
00:34:47,309 --> 00:34:50,220
it's kind of hard because there isn't

879
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:51,828
anything in this situation but let's use

880
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:56,009
this one so the red one

881
00:34:51,829 --> 00:34:57,900
DNS hostname I think that's correct it

882
00:34:56,009 --> 00:34:59,789
looks right yeah we're going to use that

883
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:02,309
and if it's not let's assume that it is

884
00:34:59,789 --> 00:35:06,269
right so I'll use that right but then

885
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:07,680
later let's say that's changed and so

886
00:35:06,269 --> 00:35:09,750
now you're in a situation where you have

887
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,069
nothing that's common and the

888
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:13,109
vulnerability management system will

889
00:35:11,069 --> 00:35:15,058
detect it at a certain IP address and it

890
00:35:13,109 --> 00:35:16,828
would declare well I've never seen this

891
00:35:15,059 --> 00:35:19,859
host before because it doesn't match

892
00:35:16,829 --> 00:35:21,900
anything so it must be a new one let me

893
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:24,089
add it to the asset list so that's

894
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:25,619
duplication now you have two hosts which

895
00:35:24,089 --> 00:35:27,450
actually had the same information and

896
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:29,640
you may actually take this and take this

897
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:32,129
host prioritize the vulnerabilities and

898
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:34,379
send it out for remediation well

899
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,850
need to discover you know after work you

900
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:37,290
know in research Wow

901
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:40,200
I don't I don't even know where that

902
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:42,000
host is or oh hey wait a sec this house

903
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,649
belongs to this other team it's not mine

904
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,580
and so there's actually what I call a

905
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:49,050
lot of chasing ghosts right so victims

906
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:54,240
and impacts I talked a little bit about

907
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:57,510
this one of the largest well there's a

908
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:59,370
lot of different issues here but one of

909
00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:01,860
them one of the sort of high level ends

910
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:03,930
is you have in your you know in most

911
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:05,880
organizations security generals right

912
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:07,859
and they're looking at this information

913
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:11,220
and they're making decisions based upon

914
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:12,960
the risk you know so if you look at what

915
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:14,970
what vulnerability management brings us

916
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,100
brings us a lot of things but it also

917
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:18,689
brings us sort of a gauge of what our

918
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:20,700
risk is across our entire network

919
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:23,760
talking about our actual you know

920
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:26,640
network security risk that's opposed to

921
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:28,980
other types of risk right well that

922
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:31,350
information they want they're making us

923
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:33,930
making decisions based upon it and often

924
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:35,850
that decision-making although perhaps is

925
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:38,520
correct based you know it's correct from

926
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:40,350
an algorithm perspective it's incorrect

927
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:43,380
because the actual data is not correct

928
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:45,330
right so if so in other words the the

929
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:47,670
vulnerability management system is is a

930
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:49,710
gauge for risk and that gauge is off

931
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:55,140
because of this issue right so that's

932
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:57,810
that mismatch scanned endpoints right so

933
00:36:55,140 --> 00:37:00,509
I had a prospect that comes to us and

934
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:02,670
told us told me a story where they were

935
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:04,500
actually like just as the example before

936
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:06,210
they were assigning out vulnerabilities

937
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:09,660
so so essentially this is a large

938
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:11,670
organization they have they were using a

939
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:13,649
different solution at the time they have

940
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:15,630
a centralized vulnerability management

941
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:17,070
team or centralized security team that

942
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:19,350
is responsible for vulnerability

943
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:23,400
management and they had different IT

944
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:26,700
teams that owned these assets right and

945
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:28,740
so they had a lot of duplication in

946
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:30,149
their asset because of this problem and

947
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:32,069
they were signing up Valle 'nor

948
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:33,690
abilities to teams that didn't even know

949
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:35,460
where the assets were because they

950
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:37,350
weren't owned by them they were owned by

951
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:41,370
a different team so that's wasting time

952
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:43,880
right so lots of other issues there so

953
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:46,740
how do you solve it

954
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:50,340
well this is what we did at digital

955
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:52,799
defense we unlike other vendors where

956
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:56,940
they're just taking a few different

957
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:58,140
characteristics simultaneously in the

958
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:00,060
case of that large vendor that I

959
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:02,580
referred to they were actually using one

960
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:05,220
simultaneously you had a choice of which

961
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:08,009
one out of three but really you're

962
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:09,000
looking at you could imagine like or

963
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:11,460
sort of you know

964
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,340
yeah the analogy I use is imagine your

965
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:17,220
fingerprint where you have all these

966
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:19,110
different ridges etc well wouldn't it be

967
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:22,140
great if you could fingerprint match

968
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:23,520
based upon everything you see but what a

969
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:25,230
lot of vendors are doing is they're

970
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,690
actually just taking one one little

971
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:29,280
Ridge one that you could one a three

972
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:31,350
that you can choose or maybe they have

973
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,060
two maybe you don't have a choice maybe

974
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:35,970
there's two or three so it's very

975
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:37,799
limiting why not use everything that you

976
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:39,180
can see and that's what we do right so

977
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,860
it's not simple because you have

978
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:42,899
different characteristics that have

979
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:46,020
different weights and there's a lot of

980
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:47,790
sort of dependencies etc but if you

981
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:50,040
could use everything that's a philosophy

982
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:52,170
if you could use everything you see then

983
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:54,180
even though you know one thing or two

984
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:56,760
things may change across time at certain

985
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:58,169
rates by and large if you're looking at

986
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:01,500
everything you kind of have a semi

987
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:03,990
static thing that you can use to match

988
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:08,940
these hosts right so that's what we do

989
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:13,229
so the ideal solution so going back to

990
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:16,710
our mismatch even though this red host

991
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:19,530
had perhaps changed its IP address the

992
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:21,300
system should actually of course realize

993
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:24,110
that and this is a simplistic case but

994
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:27,990
it should match it together so simple

995
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:30,690
diagram murder mystery solved thank you

996
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:34,350
very much for helping me with this so

997
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:35,970
security ecosystems the use case for

998
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:37,589
example at the very beginning which is

999
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:40,799
kind of you know it's a cool use case

1000
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:43,230
inner others in order to satisfy that

1001
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,330
you have to understand or the the

1002
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:48,570
vulnerability management system has to

1003
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:50,970
correctly map the given assets as it

1004
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:55,560
sees them at different points in time

1005
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:56,529
and those things change right that's the

1006
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:59,410
second point Network

1007
00:39:56,530 --> 00:40:01,870
and points change problem is most

1008
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:05,170
vulnerability management solutions use

1009
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:07,569
one or two characteristics or three but

1010
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:10,480
they don't use all of them unfortunately

1011
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:14,680
so they're very limiting how do you

1012
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:16,560
solve this well ask your vendor hey well

1013
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:19,899
how do you how do you solve this problem

1014
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:24,790
now that you're sort of more enlightened

1015
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:26,590
on it or hey use their API pull out so

1016
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:29,170
for every scan you pull out all the data

1017
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:31,690
put it in you know some place not

1018
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:34,090
necessarily a sim although perhaps you

1019
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:37,990
could and you correlate this on your own

1020
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:39,760
now not easy but it's doable and that's

1021
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:42,279
what we do but we do it within the

1022
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:45,100
context of the actual bowels of our

1023
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:48,010
vulnerability management system so

1024
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:52,560
wonderful it might be a little bit early

1025
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:52,560
but hey thank you and any questions
