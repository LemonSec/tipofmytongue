1
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:15,300
all right hello my name is Andrew hey

2
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:18,240
I'm the sea so a date of gravity we're

3
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:22,800
nashua new hampshire never hear from new

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:25,799
hampshire five people is it like right

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:30,630
now you wish your Indian action just in

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:32,250
jog got it so this talk this is the

7
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,489
second iteration of the talk that I

8
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:38,880
created I think about three years ago

9
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:40,530
now and the reason I had to do a two

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,050
point O is because I don't think many

11
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,730
people listen to my one point and

12
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,660
implemented some of the suggestions are

13
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,108
some of the glare and things that I

14
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:51,480
pointed out so i'm going to this talk is

15
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:53,460
really to highlight what has changed

16
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:57,059
what hasn't changed what can be better

17
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:59,730
and hopefully people listen to me this

18
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:02,190
time so just to give you a little bit of

19
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,378
background on me i am the sea so data

20
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:09,090
gravity I've been doing the job since

21
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:11,240
January fourth I stole their because I

22
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:16,460
had to remember what month it was now

23
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:20,669
I've been on the road since last Friday

24
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:22,559
so this is my fifth conference sorry

25
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:27,410
fifth talk at my fourth conference in

26
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,410
three states over the last seven days

27
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:36,419
some kind of burned out remember that

28
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,770
when we're buying drinks tonight so I

29
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,170
used to be the director of research at

30
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:43,949
opendns I built the research team there

31
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:47,550
up from he was around for people to the

32
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:50,190
12 when we got acquired by Cisco I was

33
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:53,880
with Cisco for three months you can

34
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:54,960
refer what you want from that I was also

35
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,610
the chief evangelist and director of

36
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,259
research at cloud passage and that's

37
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,150
really where I started doing this talk

38
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:02,130
was when i was there because i was i

39
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:04,170
found myself doing a lot of cloud

40
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:06,300
education especially around security

41
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:09,119
because there were so many people that

42
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:12,030
would say oh my CFO into this conference

43
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:14,010
and they heard about cloud have you

44
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:16,620
heard about this thing yet and we can

45
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:18,540
save all of these money all of these

46
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:24,360
bags of monies because people are only

47
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:26,130
paying pennies per hour Benny's of

48
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,050
course that was as much research as they

49
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:30,720
had done so I did a little bit more I

50
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:33,330
was also an analyst at an industry

51
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,580
analyst at 451 research where I helped a

52
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:39,120
lot of companies raise money of which

53
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:40,950
I've never seen and get them acquired

54
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,200
which didn't I got a thank-you email

55
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:45,238
every once in a while I've also worked

56
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,880
in higher education at a university in

57
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:50,959
Western Canada yes I'm Canadian but do

58
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:54,690
remember how big and tall I am before

59
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,519
casting aspersions and I also worked at

60
00:02:54,690 --> 00:03:01,079
a bank in Bermuda which sounds a lot

61
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:04,380
cooler that it actually was I was

62
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:07,860
employed 34 q1 labs massachusetts

63
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:09,750
company i am not a millionaire like the

64
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,750
people that stayed with p1 lives after

65
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:14,700
the acquisition I've written a bunch of

66
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:18,480
books that judging by my income

67
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:20,250
statements none of you have read I blog

68
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,959
occasionally and I spend an awful lot of

69
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,090
time on planes so that's just a little

70
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:25,799
bit about me you can learn more

71
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:30,290
especially the Bermuda style stuff

72
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:33,330
tonight in the-- well after drinks

73
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:36,440
so what I want to talk about today is a

74
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:39,780
lot of the challenges around cloud and

75
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:43,320
you know all jokes aside cloud security

76
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:45,300
is pretty cloudy or fuzzy at best I want

77
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:48,390
to talk about some of the existing tools

78
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:52,260
how they can help what they can do

79
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:54,779
better if anyone's looking for start-up

80
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:58,980
ideas there's a whole bunch at the end

81
00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:00,690
of this session and if how you can use

82
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,820
cloud to really do forensic

83
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:04,650
investigation and sorry is it response

84
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:07,109
activities in cloud environments and how

85
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:09,000
it could be made so much better if we

86
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:12,750
just had the right tools to do the job

87
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,510
it's not always the case so some of the

88
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:17,579
problems with cloud just calling it

89
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:19,440
cloud is that there are so many

90
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:21,899
different definitions of cloud there's

91
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,760
private cloud hybrid cloud there's

92
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:25,409
different nomenclature across the

93
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,810
different cloud platforms is it an

94
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:30,150
instance is it a guest are we talking

95
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:32,490
about SAS pass infrastructure as a

96
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:36,989
service security is a service which is a

97
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:39,030
stupid term because it's still SAS is it

98
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:41,040
on premise at off site is it posted

99
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:43,109
somewhere is it multi-tenant

100
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:47,610
single-tenant you know all of these

101
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:51,000
things are cloud of some way shape or

102
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:52,320
form so it becomes very complicated so

103
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,610
I'm sure you've seen slides like this

104
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,260
before the delineation of

105
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:57,870
responsibilities between the different

106
00:04:55,260 --> 00:05:00,320
types of cloud platforms this becomes

107
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:02,220
kind of a problem not from a deployment

108
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,570
perspective but definitely from a

109
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:06,390
forensics and incident response

110
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:09,240
capability so if you look at SAS you're

111
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:12,539
responsible for the data it's very hard

112
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,130
to do anything at the system level in a

113
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,900
SAS environment because it's not your

114
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:18,840
environment you're provided with what is

115
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:21,179
essentially a web app and a method to

116
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,849
put information in and get information

117
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:27,090
it and present it to the end user

118
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:29,760
there's not a lot you can do if that the

119
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:31,979
guest or instance becomes compromised or

120
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,690
the virtual the hypervisor comes

121
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:35,970
virtualized you just don't have that

122
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:38,610
visibility you have a little bit more in

123
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:41,600
platforms a source environment but

124
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:43,970
really it's going down to

125
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,580
configuration options in code you're not

126
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:47,960
going to have you know most times you're

127
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,520
not going to have kernel level root

128
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,650
level access you're not going to be able

129
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,469
to look down into the frameworks used

130
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:57,650
because you're provided with you know

131
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:59,330
apache and postgres you're provided with

132
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:01,060
the interface to it but you're not

133
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:05,390
really provided with much other than

134
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:07,220
some of the configuration options now if

135
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:09,169
we look at infrastructure as a service

136
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:11,360
here's where we're starting to get a

137
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:17,210
little bit more comfortable or more

138
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:19,010
familiar but with all of this access so

139
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:21,320
you're really you're responsible for the

140
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:23,240
virtual machine container all the way up

141
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,860
to the presentation layer the cloud

142
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,510
provider is going to take the hypervisor

143
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,970
all the way down to the plugs in the

144
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:30,920
data center that's their responsibility

145
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:33,370
but if you start looking at the terms of

146
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:36,680
service for the various cloud providers

147
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:39,200
you will see very quickly that security

148
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,570
is not their main business so this is

149
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:44,960
from the AWS shared responsibility model

150
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:46,280
so what I have highlighted is the parts

151
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,640
where it says the customer should assume

152
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:53,030
responsibility and management of the

153
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:55,880
guest operating system you can enhance

154
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:58,130
security if you so choose which they

155
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,719
recommend with the addition of

156
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:01,909
host-based firewalls host-based

157
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,340
intrusion detection prevention Krypton

158
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:08,360
key management center etc things that

159
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:10,820
back on prem sorry i will not say on

160
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:14,030
yeah i'll say on prem when i say on prem

161
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:17,890
I mean on-premises not on-premise just

162
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:21,200
in case anyone is like a grammar nazi

163
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:23,780
friend these are things that we would

164
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,670
have done on prem before migrating to

165
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:27,289
cloud environments right or at least we

166
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:30,320
should have done this is not something

167
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:32,870
that the CFO was told when it's pennies

168
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:35,810
on the dollar to move infrastructure in

169
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:39,320
the cloud environments now let's take a

170
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:41,510
look at Microsoft so they tell you data

171
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,500
classification and accountability client

172
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:44,180
and endpoint protection are the

173
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:47,120
responsibilities that are solely in the

174
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:49,520
domain of the customers so you're

175
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,040
probably understanding very quickly that

176
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,419
these infrastructures of service

177
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:56,490
providers or these cloud providers

178
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:59,300
are not in the business of providing you

179
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:01,920
with a safe and secure infrastructure

180
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:04,320
within which to operate they are

181
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,700
providing you just like vmware provides

182
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:08,940
you with virtualization infrastructure

183
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:10,740
they're providing you with a method to

184
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:14,480
run machines in a virtualized

185
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:18,120
environment that in some cases is off

186
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:21,840
Prem in public cloud multi-tenant

187
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:25,170
environment or its sorry off print on

188
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:27,690
Prem where it's a private cloud

189
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:29,100
infrastructure over you know a big ESX

190
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:33,270
deployment these fear deployment

191
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:35,729
whatever so does anyone here have

192
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:38,460
experience with running virtualization

193
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:40,229
infrastructure yeah what about

194
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,700
conducting forensics and instant

195
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:49,320
response activities in those

196
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:54,020
environments it's not fun so the

197
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:56,880
delineation is fairly straightforward

198
00:08:54,020 --> 00:09:01,110
but again when we're talking about cloud

199
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:03,570
forensics and it's in a response it can

200
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:06,810
be many different things some of these

201
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:08,490
vendors span multiple types of delivery

202
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:10,589
systems whether its infrastructure as a

203
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:13,470
service platforms of service software as

204
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:16,590
a service and so if you look at

205
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:18,750
microsoft office 365 the SAS offering

206
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:20,460
for platform as a service i always

207
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:23,670
forget what it's called so they would

208
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:26,880
know now say it's not just me that's

209
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:28,650
poor marketing then they have as your

210
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:32,700
cloud which is the infrastructure as a

211
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:35,910
service model AWS same thing you can run

212
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:39,000
all of these things very very easily

213
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:41,069
with a click of a few buttons doesn't

214
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,840
necessarily mean you should but means

215
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:48,180
you can so there are all sorts of

216
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:50,670
devices that are interfacing on

217
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:55,280
interacting with these various levels in

218
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:59,010
this pyramid such as mobile devices

219
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:00,959
physical media attached storage whether

220
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:03,960
it's virtualized or a physical client

221
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:06,070
ship to a data center laptops but

222
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:08,380
because we don't have eight

223
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:09,610
hours to talk about this we're just

224
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:12,000
gonna focus on infrastructure as a

225
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:15,510
service because it's really the most

226
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,610
comparable to having a physical machine

227
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:21,010
in your data center with which to

228
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:23,560
perform forensic analysis and incident

229
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:25,540
response activities on the other ones

230
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:29,859
you're going to be calling the provider

231
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:31,420
and asking for help so the five major

232
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:34,420
challenges and the things that we're

233
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:37,060
going to highlight data residents which

234
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:38,979
is a big issue especially if you perform

235
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:42,430
a lot of international business

236
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:44,680
especially with Europe physical

237
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:49,859
acquisition of these infrastructures of

238
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:55,000
service devices and instances / guests

239
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:56,380
how to isolate an instance properly I'll

240
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,240
talk a little bit of a hypervisor

241
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:59,920
introspection and data integrity I

242
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,720
should say that you're probably never

243
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,459
going to get hypervisor introspection it

244
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,880
would be awesome but you're not going to

245
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:08,470
get and then cloud service provider

246
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:12,960
collaboration and support and then I'll

247
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:15,790
talk a little bit of some future tech so

248
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:18,450
if you're conducting is anyone here ever

249
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:22,589
served in an expert witness capacity or

250
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:25,990
testifying to the validity of data i

251
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:28,180
have not for a great case it was for a

252
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:31,090
child exploitation case luckily the guy

253
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:36,099
was insane you probably got that from

254
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:38,470
the earlier statement but knowing where

255
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:43,570
the data is kept along the way adds

256
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:46,240
validity and confidence in your analysis

257
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:49,990
and your presentation of the findings to

258
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:54,670
a court via a report to someone just

259
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:56,680
your findings so where is cloud or

260
00:11:54,670 --> 00:12:00,069
where's your data stored in the various

261
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:02,410
cloud providers that's really the big

262
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:07,380
question you can't just say yes it's in

263
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:07,380
the club where cloud

264
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:16,760
so there's been an evolution in how the

265
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:20,300
various cloud providers have stated that

266
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:22,069
they support earth where tell you where

267
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:26,540
your data is stored so back in two

268
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:28,520
thousand eight amazon was saying you can

269
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:31,760
specify where you want to store your

270
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:33,890
data when you create your s3 bucket okay

271
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:37,100
well that just tells me that at that

272
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:40,670
point that's where I want I want to

273
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:43,850
specify it should be there fast forward

274
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:45,920
to 2013 within that region your objects

275
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:49,430
are redundantly stored on multiple

276
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:53,870
devices across multiple facilities okay

277
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:56,420
so if my job is incident response in

278
00:12:53,870 --> 00:13:00,589
forensics that's not a good thing to see

279
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:02,689
if my job is operational I t this is

280
00:13:00,589 --> 00:13:04,130
great you know redundancy resiliency

281
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:05,959
these are things that I want to see with

282
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:07,430
my data I want my customers or my

283
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:09,339
constituents be able to access this

284
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:13,069
information when they need it as

285
00:13:09,339 --> 00:13:15,050
incident responder I see this and I get

286
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:18,470
like I actually did get goosebumps right

287
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:20,689
there that's kind of weird that now it's

288
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:23,209
somewhere and this is where your psyche

289
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:26,149
yet cloud to the cloud somewhere in this

290
00:13:23,209 --> 00:13:28,250
region in the cloud where's the region

291
00:13:26,149 --> 00:13:30,560
well based on the map it's showing the

292
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:33,529
northeast of the United States so we'll

293
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:38,989
focus our investigation on the Northeast

294
00:13:33,529 --> 00:13:41,540
I guess most recently it's been changed

295
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:46,730
to say within that region and when they

296
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:48,620
say region they mean like AWS us East is

297
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:51,950
anyone know a big provider runs stuff in

298
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:56,450
u.s. East one or actually anyone know

299
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:59,810
where US East is located Virginia they

300
00:13:56,450 --> 00:14:03,490
know what big provider of video content

301
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:07,930
uses AWS

302
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:09,970
Netflix you know when Netflix goes down

303
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:12,459
there's a whole bunch of other vendors

304
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:16,050
that seem to go down at the same time I

305
00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:20,170
advise you to not run in u.s. East one

306
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:22,569
just because if people can't get the

307
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:24,040
Amazon the odds are that they're

308
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,420
probably not going to get to you because

309
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,520
they're a very resilient and

310
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:29,880
fault-tolerant organization it's usually

311
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:34,750
a data center problem if they go down

312
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:36,430
keep that mud so within that region your

313
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:38,290
objects are redundantly stored on

314
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:41,229
multiple devices across multiple

315
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:43,449
facilities but please refer to the

316
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:45,339
regional products and services for

317
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:47,620
details on amazon s3 service

318
00:14:45,339 --> 00:14:53,649
availability by region does anyone know

319
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:55,779
why this last little bit was added no

320
00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:58,110
nothing happened recently like safe

321
00:14:55,779 --> 00:14:58,110
harbor

322
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:07,150
yeah and you'll see a theme here in a

323
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:09,790
moment so as your 2012 I actually like

324
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:13,150
this quite a bit so they will replicate

325
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:15,339
between two sub regions within the same

326
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:18,939
major region for enhanced deeded

327
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:22,810
durability that sounds awesome I want my

328
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:28,420
data to be super durable unless I'm

329
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:31,150
doing in cell phones 2013 hey you know

330
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:33,430
what customers can choose to disable

331
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:37,390
that feature for the replication it's

332
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:40,660
not in the documentation anymore hmm so

333
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:42,670
in 2016 each Microsoft cloud service has

334
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:48,520
its own location policies for customer

335
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:51,189
data say if ever Google so back in 2013

336
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:53,770
at this time selection of data center

337
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:56,130
will make no guarantee that project data

338
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:58,180
at rest is kept only in that region I

339
00:15:56,130 --> 00:16:01,360
got a hand to them at least they're

340
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:03,189
honest it's not saying you know well it

341
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,960
might be moved around here they're

342
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:06,280
saying look you know we're trying to

343
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,530
replicate this we're trying to get

344
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:11,170
stable we're still relatively new it

345
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:16,030
could be anywhere deal with it we're not

346
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:19,540
doing evil we have a slogan acesso 2014

347
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:24,010
hey that data at rest it's not in the

348
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:28,860
region anymore 2016 specific regional

349
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:32,880
information again safe harbor so now

350
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:35,230
finding data within a particular region

351
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,300
within a particular provider is

352
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:39,460
difficult and being able to point your

353
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:41,949
finger and say I know for example my

354
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:44,440
data is there with a physical server you

355
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:46,120
can walk to the data center and say you

356
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,520
know i'm ninety-nine percent sure it is

357
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:51,010
on this dell server right here or on

358
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:54,090
this storage array you can't really do

359
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:56,050
that with cloud with any great certainty

360
00:16:54,090 --> 00:17:00,850
and what happens if you're using

361
00:16:56,050 --> 00:17:05,919
multiple clouds again data resiliency

362
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:09,870
and data durability back four years ago

363
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:12,660
50 G's five years ago

364
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:16,319
there was this idea that people someday

365
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:19,140
would start moving their cloud or sort

366
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:21,540
of moving their on-prem workloads to

367
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:23,370
multiple clouds for resiliency so you

368
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:26,790
would have data shared between Rackspace

369
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:28,590
AWS Google whole bunch of companies spun

370
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:30,420
up and said that we will help you manage

371
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:32,669
this migration and keep track of the

372
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:35,400
data and you know one goes down will

373
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:41,430
spin it up over here and DevOps DevOps

374
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:43,050
daaa so that is horrible from it's a

375
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:45,750
response perspective cuz now you're

376
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:47,428
relying on other tools to figure out

377
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:49,590
where the data may have been moved and

378
00:17:47,429 --> 00:17:52,530
then within that region it could have

379
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:55,590
been replicated somewhere else based on

380
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:59,280
the type of instance that was used so

381
00:17:55,590 --> 00:18:02,959
it's just snowballs out of control so

382
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:07,490
catching a cloud instance is very hard

383
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:10,679
but you know a specific cloud is

384
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:13,650
extremely hard finding your data on a

385
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:19,950
specific cloud instance I'll leave it

386
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:25,320
here dancy Waldo Wow not bad yeah eagle

387
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:28,200
eyes you know I've used that slide for

388
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:30,980
about six years and no one's ever found

389
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:34,080
it or they're not paying attention so

390
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:37,530
thanks on both fronts so physical

391
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:40,820
acquisition of data in cloud

392
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:43,590
infrastructures or of a physical image

393
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:45,870
extremely difficult unless you own the

394
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:49,439
data center or unless you are running a

395
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:52,050
private cloud infrastructure if your

396
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,780
name rhymes with Netflix you may be able

397
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:56,700
to work something out but you're

398
00:18:54,780 --> 00:19:00,210
probably going to be stuck with logical

399
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:02,370
snapshots so if you call up to Amazon

400
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:05,700
say hey do you know what I pay ten

401
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:07,379
dollars a month I demand support you

402
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,620
know I'm one of your biggest customers I

403
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:12,070
spent a hundred twenty dollars a year

404
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:14,560
they're gonna say okay

405
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:16,240
yeah sure we don't help you if you're

406
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:19,179
spending like hundreds of millions of

407
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:23,320
dollars a year they may help you a

408
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:26,920
little bit so the three ways that i know

409
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:29,919
of of getting data from AWS and some of

410
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:31,270
this actually does transition or does

411
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:34,600
intersect with some of the other cloud

412
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:41,139
providers is creating a snapshot of the

413
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:43,389
volume mount it copy it you can have aw

414
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:45,760
a ship you the data you'll see why that

415
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:47,920
seems a lot better or sounds better than

416
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:51,490
it actually is and then you can use

417
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:54,880
software tools to actually compress

418
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:56,800
encrypt sign and download which sounds

419
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:01,540
pretty awesome but again we're talking

420
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:02,950
logical here so I'll go through this

421
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:09,180
very quickly you can reference the

422
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:12,790
slides so this is just like performing

423
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:14,740
acquisition on a live system with the

424
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:16,180
exception of you know you're not moving

425
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:18,940
physical hard drives around plugging

426
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:22,540
cables in getting right blockers etc etc

427
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:25,510
so launch an ami stop the instance of

428
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:27,340
your target detach the volume create a

429
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:30,400
snapshot of that volume attach the

430
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:32,310
volume to the new am I create the EBS

431
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:37,870
volume that is going to be the same size

432
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:40,990
attach the volume execute your standard

433
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:43,870
file system commands used ed to make an

434
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:46,450
image seems pretty in pretty similar to

435
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:48,820
anyone had to do this in the past ever

436
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:51,720
these commands of sort of this process

437
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:54,970
has kind of been around for the last 15

438
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:58,690
I'd say even 20 years that might be

439
00:20:54,970 --> 00:21:03,190
pushing it a bit but this these steps

440
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:04,930
actually came from Lance at AWS in the

441
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:07,300
user forums someone asked the question

442
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:09,310
like hey how can I get this and he's

443
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:11,500
like oh well here are all the steps that

444
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:13,120
I've done this is an official policy but

445
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:17,700
this is what I suggest that you try and

446
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:21,549
do very helpful good work amazon

447
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:24,910
so s three if you are storing your data

448
00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:29,470
in an s3 bucket you can physically ship

449
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:32,980
a USB Drive to Amazon for a eighty

450
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:36,070
dollar per device handling fee and 249

451
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:39,010
per day to loading our so I advise not

452
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:41,409
using a USB one hard drive because it

453
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:43,419
could take a while they will ship it

454
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:45,880
they'll copy the information and they

455
00:21:43,419 --> 00:21:51,210
will physically ship it to you so at

456
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:51,210
what point does a chain of custody

457
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:59,790
become a problem when so in my apartment

458
00:21:55,419 --> 00:22:02,500
complex we have this you always have the

459
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:05,320
shipping people that will say okay well

460
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:06,970
you know it requires a signature we

461
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:10,178
won't deliver it unless it requires a

462
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:12,520
signature but then it just kind of ends

463
00:22:10,179 --> 00:22:14,470
up like thrown on the floor so no one's

464
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:16,179
signing for it it's really hard to do

465
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:19,660
chain of custody when you're handing it

466
00:22:16,179 --> 00:22:23,620
to a shipper unless they are physically

467
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:24,790
delivering it to you by hand so I guess

468
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:26,860
the moral the stories don't ship

469
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:31,230
evidence hard drives to your apartment

470
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:31,229
complex or my apartment complex at least

471
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:38,430
and what will actually get back to this

472
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:41,210
slide in a minute dear so the am I tools

473
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:43,800
this is where you can compress encrypt

474
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:45,900
sign download this is probably your best

475
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:48,690
bet it could take a very long time

476
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:51,540
depending on the size of the data but at

477
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:53,550
least you have compression encryption

478
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:57,030
and signing of the data you can pull it

479
00:22:53,550 --> 00:23:01,409
down locally analyze the snapshot as if

480
00:22:57,030 --> 00:23:03,090
you would any other system so has anyone

481
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:07,980
heard of the Dijkstra Sherman experiment

482
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:09,270
so Josiah Josiah dextra and I can't I

483
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:15,480
can't remember what Sherman's first name

484
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:21,389
is or what the tea is they went as part

485
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:23,490
of i think was part of Josiah PhD thesis

486
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:25,440
they wanted to go and test all of the

487
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:27,150
tools that are used for forensics and

488
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,960
incident response in cloud environments

489
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:34,770
to see how they'd fare so if you take a

490
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:38,310
look you can see that you know the

491
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:41,700
standard tools in case ftk fast up

492
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:47,700
memorize ftk imager so these remembering

493
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:51,060
things agent injection which is in an

494
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:54,630
AWS export so this bottom one is the

495
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:59,190
shipping of the physical drive as you

496
00:23:54,630 --> 00:24:00,560
can see the bottom one took 120 hours so

497
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:02,970
if you are in the midst of an

498
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:05,040
investigation and it's a sensitive

499
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:07,380
investigation you have nothing but time

500
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:09,690
on your hands so you can just sit there

501
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:11,760
total your thumbs and wait for 120 hours

502
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:14,840
for the data to get to you it should

503
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:19,440
also be noted that they didn't use a

504
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:21,659
substantial file or collection of files

505
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,220
of a substantial or significant size in

506
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,720
order to conduct this experiment we're

507
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:27,870
not talking about like terabytes or

508
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:30,570
petabytes of data 520 hours I could go

509
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:33,659
through the roof very easily and when

510
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:38,070
people want answers 120 hours waiting is

511
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:41,310
still way too long so I encourage you to

512
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:42,260
read the the analysis it's very very

513
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:48,750
interesting

514
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:52,799
now hypervisor introspection yes ah just

515
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:58,770
live so you have to do a live capture so

516
00:24:52,799 --> 00:25:02,940
you can use memorize or recall or no no

517
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:05,429
there I could all be there because those

518
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:07,080
are huge memory pools that would because

519
00:25:05,429 --> 00:25:09,270
it's a multi-tenant environment they

520
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:14,370
couldn't explicitly carve it just your

521
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:16,440
data so hypervisor introspection this

522
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:20,908
has been around since the days of ids

523
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:23,760
where you can passively watch all the

524
00:25:20,909 --> 00:25:29,580
traffic without anyone really knowing so

525
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:31,740
in terms of a hypervisor this is cool

526
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:33,720
because you could look at files you

527
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:37,230
could run all of your tools and the end

528
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:41,880
user would not be aware on the negative

529
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:43,860
side you can access these files run all

530
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:47,610
these tools and the end user would never

531
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:49,649
be aware so it's very covert it's very

532
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:53,340
low level you can access pretty much

533
00:25:49,649 --> 00:25:56,520
anything but on the plus side it has to

534
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:59,309
be enabled and you're not going to get

535
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:02,010
this enabled by default I think for even

536
00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:03,299
for ESX you have to dig really really

537
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:07,620
deep to find out how to turn on

538
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:10,168
hypervisor introspection if this was

539
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:12,360
implemented by the major cloud providers

540
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:16,350
which from an incident response

541
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:19,289
perspective would be amazing you would

542
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:22,230
probably have a ridiculous series of

543
00:26:19,289 --> 00:26:26,399
legal battles and class action lawsuits

544
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:29,700
coming as a result one of the challenges

545
00:26:26,399 --> 00:26:32,760
of introspection is proving data

546
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:34,529
integrity so if you find out if you're

547
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:37,799
an end user you find out that hypervisor

548
00:26:34,529 --> 00:26:40,970
introspection is enabled that means that

549
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:43,590
someone could have altered your data and

550
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:45,600
you can just claim Mike oh well I've

551
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:47,789
been told that introspection was enabled

552
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,770
you can't really prove it's me it could

553
00:26:47,789 --> 00:26:51,899
have been the person who has direct

554
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:55,330
access to the introspection

555
00:26:51,899 --> 00:26:58,299
engine or visibility they could have

556
00:26:55,330 --> 00:27:02,559
modified they they put all that elicit

557
00:26:58,299 --> 00:27:04,059
content on my share wasn't me so very

558
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:05,289
hard to prove integrity in that respect

559
00:27:04,059 --> 00:27:09,850
but you're probably not going to run

560
00:27:05,289 --> 00:27:16,929
into that because it's hard to get so in

561
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:18,969
terms of forensic image capture we have

562
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:21,940
always been told that a physical machine

563
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:26,110
that you're investigating the first

564
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:28,570
thing you do not do is pull the plug or

565
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:30,418
sort of pull the ethernet cable the

566
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:33,759
second thing is you don't power it off

567
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:38,350
in cloud we have to throw that

568
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:40,929
completely out the window so because you

569
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:44,559
if you power something off then you lose

570
00:27:40,929 --> 00:27:46,119
all the volatile memory and execution

571
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:49,470
points and anything that's been touched

572
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:53,559
on the system that is deemed volatile if

573
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:56,110
you do not isolate the instance then you

574
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:58,539
can't guarantee that it isn't going to

575
00:27:56,110 --> 00:28:01,330
continue to be monkeyed with as you're

576
00:27:58,539 --> 00:28:04,330
performing your investigation so what I

577
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:10,949
usually recommend in this case is moving

578
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:15,960
it to a secure so in AWS they're called

579
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:19,690
like all not server groups someone said

580
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:21,759
for me yes security er their security

581
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:24,610
yours yeah so if you move it to a

582
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:28,860
security group that only allows your

583
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:32,168
analyst station access then you can

584
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:33,549
testify if call to that you were the

585
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:36,220
only one that had the ability to access

586
00:28:33,549 --> 00:28:37,929
that machine at that time I have to be

587
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:42,460
careful though if you're moving these

588
00:28:37,929 --> 00:28:44,799
into into security groups or behind

589
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:47,950
security groups that other systems are

590
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:50,730
running in it's very hard to prove that

591
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:54,789
there wasn't some sort of contamination

592
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:56,580
so if you isolate it you can say at the

593
00:28:54,789 --> 00:29:00,509
time that I conducted my investigation

594
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:05,519
the instance was located in this region

595
00:29:00,509 --> 00:29:07,829
the data was stored in this region and

596
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:13,109
possibly sub-regions depending on how

597
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:17,809
the wording of the documentation is you

598
00:29:13,109 --> 00:29:20,759
can conclude that incoming and outgoing

599
00:29:17,809 --> 00:29:22,859
communications you should be the only

600
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:25,009
one initiating new communications into

601
00:29:22,859 --> 00:29:28,079
the machine because it's firewalled off

602
00:29:25,009 --> 00:29:29,489
outgoing blocking you're preventing so

603
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:32,279
if it's part of the command control

604
00:29:29,489 --> 00:29:35,639
session or data is trying to be ex

605
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:41,269
filled then you've essentially blocked

606
00:29:35,639 --> 00:29:45,178
that so by isolating it you can make it

607
00:29:41,269 --> 00:29:47,069
easier to collect not contaminate it you

608
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:49,549
separate it from your production

609
00:29:47,069 --> 00:29:52,349
workloads you're not going to taint it

610
00:29:49,549 --> 00:29:55,679
it's great you know this this is an

611
00:29:52,349 --> 00:29:59,908
ideal situation it's not hard I actually

612
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:02,129
wrote a tool that will do this in AWS

613
00:29:59,909 --> 00:30:06,229
but nobody uses is because it's written

614
00:30:02,129 --> 00:30:10,319
in Ruby so most forensics people are

615
00:30:06,229 --> 00:30:12,719
hardcore Python zealots and they make

616
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:15,299
fun of me when I right Ruby so I'm

617
00:30:12,719 --> 00:30:17,159
slowly transitioning the tool over to

618
00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:21,299
Ruby Mae Pierce right over to python

619
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:22,949
create a UI so that's kind of point and

620
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:25,739
click move things around isolated

621
00:30:22,949 --> 00:30:29,219
instances it's kind of like a poor man's

622
00:30:25,739 --> 00:30:32,039
club passage or there's a bunch of other

623
00:30:29,219 --> 00:30:36,389
tools that do it now too but stay tuned

624
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:39,449
for that so getting support from your

625
00:30:36,389 --> 00:30:42,389
cloud provider it's not always that easy

626
00:30:39,449 --> 00:30:47,609
again unless your company name rhymes

627
00:30:42,389 --> 00:30:50,039
with Netflix a lot of a lot of these

628
00:30:47,609 --> 00:30:52,678
cloud providers have very very smart

629
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:55,739
people that are willing to help but if

630
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:58,139
you are looking to undertake a new cloud

631
00:30:55,739 --> 00:31:01,619
project or trying to figure out where

632
00:30:58,139 --> 00:31:04,948
you should throw your money from a cloud

633
00:31:01,619 --> 00:31:07,168
infrastructure perspective you need to

634
00:31:04,949 --> 00:31:09,340
find out from them what level they are

635
00:31:07,169 --> 00:31:13,540
going to exert how far you have to

636
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:15,220
Oh after they help you and at what point

637
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:16,629
are they just going to throw their hands

638
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:19,960
up and say look we can't help you

639
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:22,960
anymore this is beyond our knowledge the

640
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:25,120
last thing you want to is to be told to

641
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,220
email into support and get some first

642
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:30,399
level person who I'm sure is very good

643
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:33,330
at helping with certain things forensic

644
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:36,520
image capture and incident response is

645
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:39,970
likely not one of their specialties so

646
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:41,950
if you can if you have the clout you can

647
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:44,410
ask for samples of past investigations

648
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:45,730
could be obfuscated of reports it's kind

649
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:47,200
of like when you're doing a pen test or

650
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:49,090
you're shopping around for a pen test

651
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,440
you don't want to take the firm at face

652
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:53,189
value you want to see what they've done

653
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:55,420
in the past to see if they're any good

654
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:57,280
you want to see if they're employing

655
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:59,560
methodologies if they have a documented

656
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,940
procedure or if it's just hey we're

657
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:05,290
going to we're going to see what happens

658
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:09,220
here you laugh but a side note i was on

659
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:10,659
a puddle-jumper plane once twin prop and

660
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:13,510
we're flying around the airport for

661
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:15,700
about an hour and the captain came on

662
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:19,030
and said well we've been trying to

663
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:22,120
figure out how to fix this but the flaps

664
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:23,860
aren't working we don't think we need

665
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:27,429
them to land so we're going to give it a

666
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:29,080
shot pretty sure that wasn't a

667
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:30,910
documented procedure that was kind of

668
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,899
yeah let's see let's see what happens

669
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:33,540
that's what you want to hear from your

670
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:37,650
pilot now we're gonna give it a shot

671
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:37,649
what's the worst that could happen yeah

672
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:44,130
asking for the credentials of staff I

673
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:47,860
don't think that's too much to ask for

674
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:49,630
if and this is a huge if this is likely

675
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:51,760
never going to happen but if you can

676
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:54,400
have an interview with some of the cloud

677
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,600
service provider team members that would

678
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:58,300
be great because then you can get

679
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:00,370
confidence as to see if they actually

680
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:03,790
know that there are methodologies that

681
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:05,350
they should be following if they have

682
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:07,060
been involved in any of past

683
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:08,860
investigations that they can talk about

684
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:11,129
so you can get a feel for them it's an

685
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:11,129
interview

686
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:20,370
so it's not all doom and gloom there are

687
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:23,100
a lot of existing tools that can help

688
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:26,179
with cloud incident response and

689
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:29,399
forensic activities they're evolving

690
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:32,640
more and more but one of the big

691
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:35,550
challenges it's not just technical it's

692
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:38,820
wanting an understanding the need to

693
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:40,290
conduct investigations in cloud

694
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:45,030
environments outside of our comfort zone

695
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:46,860
so we have been told that you know we

696
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:53,389
need physical systems to perform

697
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:57,090
forensic activities on or a properly

698
00:33:53,390 --> 00:34:00,810
sequestered image whether it be memory

699
00:33:57,090 --> 00:34:04,889
or drive and then only then can we

700
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:06,030
perform our activities you're probably

701
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:08,130
not going to get that you're not going

702
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:11,790
to get physical drives in cloud

703
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:15,570
environments it's just not possible you

704
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:19,830
may have to get very comfortable going

705
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:21,570
forward with storing your investigative

706
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:27,239
images in cloud environments there's a

707
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:29,490
lot of a lot of very good ways to sign

708
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:31,709
something encrypt it compress it and

709
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:34,620
then send it up to long-term storage in

710
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:37,920
Amazon glacier or Azure blob storage

711
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:40,409
that you can certify has been untouched

712
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:44,520
because you put it up there following

713
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:47,480
this methodology processing things off

714
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:50,400
site we are going to see more and more

715
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:53,460
forensics and I are vendors providing

716
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:55,889
SAS portals to perform the tasks that

717
00:34:53,460 --> 00:35:00,120
they only ever did with packaged

718
00:34:55,889 --> 00:35:04,410
software before and launching off site

719
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:06,600
analysis consoles as much as the big

720
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:10,710
vendors would hate this because they

721
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:13,650
want to sell per seat licensing for you

722
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:17,850
know in perpetuity eventually they're

723
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:20,160
going to be forced to have certain like

724
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:22,569
elastic time regions in order to conduct

725
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:26,670
activities because let's be honest

726
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:26,670
these tools are expensive most times and

727
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,850
they they become shelf where after a

728
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,930
while if you don't have a lot of

729
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:34,950
incidents or if you don't have the

730
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:38,290
expertise to conduct the investigations

731
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:41,830
so I'll give you some free stuff NBD

732
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:46,360
server does anyone use this before it is

733
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:51,520
a fantastic way to remotely interface

734
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:53,560
with a Windows device and mount mount

735
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,780
the partition is a block device you can

736
00:35:53,560 --> 00:36:01,720
also use volatility and recall to image

737
00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:04,300
the memory hey so it's very very easy

738
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:06,480
you know you run the server on the cot

739
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:10,900
on the host that you want to investigate

740
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:15,820
on your client and there are various

741
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:17,860
clients for linux and windows just

742
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:20,290
connect to it and then you can run

743
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:26,790
commands like fls to start generating a

744
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:29,470
timeline simple so there have been

745
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:32,140
there's active development on these

746
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:36,520
projects so I actually updated this

747
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:42,580
about 10 minutes ago well sorry 50

748
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:44,590
minutes ago and so the top one you know

749
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:48,240
that's the one that I was referencing

750
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:52,320
over here 16 days ago his last commit

751
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:56,200
this one here if you are using OpenStack

752
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:58,540
hey there's an OpenStack object NBD

753
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:01,270
version cool for swift or whatever

754
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:04,350
they're calling it this week then

755
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:07,540
there's this one here pure python to

756
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:09,279
latest emit 29 days ago I will warm you

757
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:12,279
that the latest commit was actually just

758
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:15,540
fixing the case of a letter but hey at

759
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,540
least someone cares enough to do

760
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:23,570
f response anyone use F response so this

761
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:27,359
is an old version 404 this is the first

762
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:29,850
inclusion of any sort of cloud

763
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:32,160
capability so they did amazon s3 buckets

764
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:34,620
HP Rackspace cloud containers as your

765
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:40,680
blog storage let you mount remote

766
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:45,359
systems our remote file objects in the

767
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:48,540
latest version as of March and emerge

768
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:53,730
you can do amazon s3 blob storage again

769
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:57,120
box Dropbox Gmail Google Apps HP Helion

770
00:37:53,730 --> 00:38:00,570
Rackspace cloud office 365 so at least

771
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:02,819
these guys are making progress there's

772
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:06,120
not a lot of money to entice them to do

773
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:10,650
this right now cloud isn't as lucrative

774
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:13,710
as people would tell you because there's

775
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:16,890
so many so many data centers still

776
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:18,960
around so they're they're kind of

777
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:20,870
playing they're betting on the long game

778
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,220
where this is going to be relevant it

779
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:26,190
granted it's relevant now but it's not

780
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:27,959
as relevant as data center based

781
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:32,010
investigations or workstation

782
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:34,920
investigations and you can even spin up

783
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:36,750
an F response instance in the cloud to

784
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:39,420
do this collection so you don't have to

785
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:42,300
do it on your system which is pretty

786
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:46,170
cool is anyone here know Chad tilbury

787
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:49,320
does a lot of saying stuff he was a big

788
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:53,490
fan of F response and he kept talking

789
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:56,180
about how it's a genius idea it's really

790
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:58,950
just using the I scuzzy protocol and

791
00:38:56,180 --> 00:39:01,140
mounting things why why can't we all do

792
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:03,000
this so I had this idea I stood in front

793
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:05,460
of the room and I'm like you know what I

794
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,770
will give you a link to open I scuzzy

795
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:11,010
the code base I'll give you the link to

796
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:13,380
the ice guzzi org site go out and build

797
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:16,290
me a tool so I don't have to pay for F

798
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:21,720
response and then it was just crickets

799
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:24,250
no one really cared to help you screw

800
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:29,680
those guys but

801
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:31,450
windows 2008 r2 plus plus I scuzzy

802
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:34,270
target you can now create on a windows

803
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:37,720
server which is pretty cool because now

804
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:40,150
with any client and you there's actually

805
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:41,589
this is great this walkthrough gives you

806
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:43,870
all the PowerShell scripts to set it up

807
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:46,530
on a remote host so there's really no

808
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:49,420
manual clicking around to do this either

809
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:51,340
so what you can do is download one of

810
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:53,860
the various Isaac as the initiator

811
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:56,110
clients connect to this remote Windows

812
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:58,870
system and do pretty much everything f

813
00:39:56,110 --> 00:40:04,390
response did but with free and open

814
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:06,250
source tools yay I had no part in any of

815
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:07,839
this by the way I facism this is the

816
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:12,400
result of me just waiting long enough

817
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:20,530
for something cool to happen anyone used

818
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:25,390
ger yeah it's great now in 2011 not so

819
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:28,630
great by developers for developers it

820
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:32,440
was I was told that it was deployed

821
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:37,300
within Google on hundreds of thousands

822
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:40,150
of machines I i would think told

823
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:43,390
hundreds of thousands i think i was told

824
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:47,020
by some artificial number or something

825
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:49,359
but it allows you to run commands for

826
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:53,020
image capture and grab information

827
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:56,710
across all these systems by running a an

828
00:40:53,020 --> 00:41:00,400
activity the latest version is a lot

829
00:40:56,710 --> 00:41:03,580
more friendly for the non developer it's

830
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:06,700
still you know very python-based it has

831
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:08,560
plugins that allow letting users recall

832
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:12,189
from memory analysis there's nothing

833
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:13,900
saying you can't run these these gurren

834
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:15,520
points on your cloud infrastructure

835
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:17,590
might just take a little bit longer to

836
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:21,550
pull the information down but this isn't

837
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:23,770
too bad so I encourage that you take a

838
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:26,050
look by the way this is developed by the

839
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:29,730
guys at Google but the G does not stand

840
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:29,730
for Google for legal reasons

841
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:35,450
a couple other tools so people just

842
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,790
pointed these out to me used to be

843
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:41,419
called wire speed it's now called evam

844
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:43,130
entry you can tell by the way analyzes

845
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:50,170
spell that this is not an American

846
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:54,140
company there's also turb idia made by

847
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:56,270
well Corey and in yo hand they presented

848
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:58,759
on it i asked corey four slides he's

849
00:41:56,270 --> 00:42:00,200
like we don't have any slides we do you

850
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:02,390
have any code no we don't mean code

851
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:06,350
that's public okay so i'll just mention

852
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:08,509
this and you can watch that space bry

853
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:11,240
more labs a lot of really cool live

854
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:13,640
forensic capture and instant response

855
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:17,689
tools you should definitely check those

856
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:20,000
out so i did say you know there's

857
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:22,610
challenges i gave you some tools now

858
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,890
this is the future tech if anyone has

859
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:27,620
played civilization you know what that

860
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:29,330
means if anyone is wasted years of their

861
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:35,569
lives playing civilization you know that

862
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:38,390
means so the advantages so here's where

863
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:41,180
the startup ideas come in so you can do

864
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:42,680
automated instruments isolation you knew

865
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:45,350
that was a lot of DevOps tools now

866
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:47,149
there's just a little back-end work that

867
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:49,670
you have to do to actually make that

868
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:50,840
works well happen so that's probably if

869
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:53,570
you're gonna build a start-up don't do

870
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:56,870
that one on demand forensic work benches

871
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:59,240
those are starting to evolve where you

872
00:42:56,870 --> 00:43:00,980
click a button and say i need an instant

873
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:02,720
response dashboard to do something and

874
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:05,120
then i want it to go away and i don't

875
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:07,910
want to pay i want to pay on an hourly

876
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:09,620
basis and not on a yearly basis we're

877
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:12,700
getting there don't do that start up

878
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:16,160
either automated timeline generation

879
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:18,259
this is great so i'm a big fan of

880
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:20,060
timelines when it comes to forensics it

881
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:23,090
is a response because you can narrow the

882
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:24,890
scope of your research to order your

883
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:27,500
investigation to a certain time period

884
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:29,900
based on when an incident first happened

885
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:32,140
and when it stopped happening and then

886
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:38,540
you can just focus on that little area

887
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:41,299
if you take some of the tools that the

888
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:42,529
grr you select plas 0 which used to be

889
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:47,120
logged a timeline

890
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:50,060
and create some rapper that you can

891
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:52,580
deploy this to all of your running

892
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:55,430
instances that would be cool i'd use

893
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:58,279
that dynamic analysis workers one of the

894
00:43:55,430 --> 00:44:02,690
biggest challenges that i was told from

895
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:05,560
a forensic forensic analysis perspective

896
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:08,540
was given to me by former NYPD detective

897
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:10,310
he said that he would go home and he

898
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:13,070
would have a stack of hard drives on his

899
00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:15,590
desk this high and he get through three

900
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:17,480
of them he'd go home he'd come back and

901
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:19,250
there were like six more it was just a

902
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:21,560
never-ending battle and he couldn't

903
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:22,910
retire he set this in his head like I'm

904
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:24,710
not retiring until I get through these

905
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:27,290
drives but he gotta stop giving me new

906
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:31,730
drives otherwise i can never retire he's

907
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:34,970
since retired but a lot of this analysis

908
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:37,280
happens in serial so it's not a parallel

909
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:40,520
activity so wouldn't it be cool if you

910
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:43,070
could take multiple drive images push

911
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:45,740
them up to an engine that would start

912
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:48,710
analyzing things in parallel and then

913
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:50,419
telling you when they were done so that

914
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:54,530
you can start farming that work out to

915
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:57,110
maybe junior people or spending time as

916
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:59,270
you need to based on how important that

917
00:44:57,110 --> 00:45:01,340
particular investigation is same thing

918
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:03,020
with distributed file carving a lot of

919
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:04,730
times you'll look at a forensic image

920
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:06,980
you'll say give me all Microsoft

921
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:09,830
documents okay I got those now give me

922
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:12,680
all image files now give me this this

923
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:15,470
this and it's it becomes very

924
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:17,330
computationally intensive to get that

925
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:20,540
information because you're just trying

926
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:22,640
to extract bits and bytes and turn them

927
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:25,220
into files and dump them somewhere so

928
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:27,200
why not create this orchestration layer

929
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:30,080
that pushes everything up to cloud and

930
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:32,120
say okay this cloud instance does word

931
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:34,790
docs this one does excel this one does

932
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:36,230
pictures etc etc etc and it's going to

933
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:38,810
cost you a lot less than having a whole

934
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:40,670
bunch of physical systems and a

935
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:43,310
multi-cloud analysis this kind of goes

936
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:47,180
with the on-demand work benches so if

937
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:48,740
you end the workers where if you want to

938
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:50,919
push things to multiple clouds for

939
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:55,118
resiliency

940
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:57,490
more power to you I have a couple slides

941
00:45:55,119 --> 00:46:01,030
left so just ignore if they look like

942
00:45:57,490 --> 00:46:05,558
they're having fun they're really not so

943
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:07,780
this is the basis for a lot of forensics

944
00:46:05,559 --> 00:46:12,579
and incident response training and

945
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:16,119
knowledge very good document a little

946
00:46:12,579 --> 00:46:18,280
bit dated but you know there's only so

947
00:46:16,119 --> 00:46:20,470
much you can do the cloud computing

948
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:23,559
forensic science working group I was on

949
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:27,660
there for a while but with most working

950
00:46:23,559 --> 00:46:31,119
groups they move at the speed of NIST so

951
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:34,359
I'm hoping that the stuff we worked on

952
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:35,589
when that first started probably be

953
00:46:34,359 --> 00:46:40,720
published in the next two or three years

954
00:46:35,589 --> 00:46:43,259
I think already irrelevant that's how

955
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:47,649
working groups work

956
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:50,680
here's some links this is a fantastic

957
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:53,830
resource it's not updated as much as it

958
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:56,140
should be but there's a lot of papers

959
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:57,910
like scientific research papers from

960
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:59,620
that link that you can learn more about

961
00:46:57,910 --> 00:47:03,160
the challenges and opportunities in

962
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:04,900
cloud security also watch this space

963
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:10,089
because this is where i'm going to be

964
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:13,180
posting the the tool suite for isolating

965
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:16,030
your incidents at some point bottom line

966
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:17,560
is that it has to be done before dfr WS

967
00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:19,420
because i submitted a talk there and if

968
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:22,240
it gets accepted I'm screwed if the

969
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:25,780
codes not complete so that I've got a

970
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:28,560
forcing function there so just to

971
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:30,670
summarize cloud forensics and I are you

972
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:33,700
have to have an open mind when you're

973
00:47:30,670 --> 00:47:36,340
talking about cloud can't think of the

974
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:38,560
brick and mortar data centers and work

975
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:40,450
the physical servers and having the

976
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:44,980
device in your hand that's just not the

977
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:46,960
case anymore you can use cloud use the

978
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:50,860
advantages offered by plug to conduct

979
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:54,340
investigations and the tools though they

980
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:55,900
are evolving slowly need to continue to

981
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:58,330
evolve and again there's not a lot of

982
00:47:55,900 --> 00:48:00,370
money in cloud from a forensics point of

983
00:47:58,330 --> 00:48:06,400
view that does anyone know the

984
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:09,580
proportion of of revenue for like a

985
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:12,520
guidance software or access data how

986
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:16,020
much of that goes to ediscovery versus

987
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:19,330
forensics it's like a 9010 split

988
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:21,250
ediscovery pays the bills ten percent of

989
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:23,860
the forensics is the cool stuff that I

990
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:26,280
care about they don't make a lot of

991
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:26,280
money on that

992
00:48:26,599 --> 00:48:33,349
so with that if you want to email me

993
00:48:30,589 --> 00:48:35,538
follow me on Twitter I tweet a lot of

994
00:48:33,349 --> 00:48:37,579
inane stuff I'm going to be around for

995
00:48:35,539 --> 00:48:39,849
the rest of the day all right thank you

996
00:48:37,579 --> 00:48:39,849
very much
