1
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:12,190
as I said I'm a Western pecker

2
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:13,839
just literally on boarded with a wrap

3
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:16,448
about a week ago so it's doing pretty

4
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:18,789
good and yeah I'm going to do a little

5
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:21,250
bit of a introduction here so thus

6
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:23,410
senior security engineer a senior pen

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:25,480
tester researcher like I said I've been

8
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:27,099
doing pen testing about 11 years spoken

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,890
several just got accepted to be doing a

10
00:00:27,099 --> 00:00:32,619
similar talk to this at hope so takedown

11
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:35,020
con also just got my black hat accepted

12
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:37,510
also an ATM hacking so that'll be pretty

13
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:39,070
awesome and yeah there's a couple other

14
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:40,899
speaking engagements like you said 12

15
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,910
years programming security engineering

16
00:00:40,899 --> 00:00:43,780
so it's something that I definitely got

17
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:46,209
a little bit of background and then I

18
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:48,370
was doing a actual for DARPA and

19
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:50,159
department homeland security actually

20
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:52,629
doing 911 attack mitigation so they're

21
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:54,248
basically paying me and some people from

22
00:00:52,629 --> 00:00:57,068
the University of Houston to develop

23
00:00:54,249 --> 00:00:58,600
mitigation strategies for 911 and call

24
00:00:57,069 --> 00:01:00,670
center environments against telephone

25
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,079
denial service so that's a pretty

26
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:03,069
awesome project that's like I said this

27
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,400
year I've been hacking point-of-sale

28
00:01:03,069 --> 00:01:09,159
systems hotel keys pretty much cars

29
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,560
everything so that's been a very busy

30
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:13,510
year so and yeah I'm gonna go over

31
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,430
ransomware how to make your system

32
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:17,230
immune to modern ransomware and it's

33
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:18,790
something where while I was pulling some

34
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:20,500
out were apart I actually came across

35
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:21,820
t'kul things that I just thought it'd

36
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,980
give out as concept and it's something

37
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:26,559
that I've actually worked in production

38
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:27,730
for it so yeah here's some day I'm gonna

39
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,260
go over to actual tools used a brief

40
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:30,370
history of malware and ransom or at a

41
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:32,410
security conference so I won't go too

42
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,700
deeply into that but it's a how i came

43
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:36,759
across the malware it's actually a

44
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:38,560
pretty funny story so how i pulled apart

45
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,660
malware to look to the payloads the

46
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,070
actual droppers how to defend your

47
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,929
systems from the droppers and the main

48
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:45,399
payloads on the past people just a

49
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:48,670
little bit heuristic data or they've

50
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:51,070
relied on very expensive IDS's and IPS

51
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:52,750
system so it's something that basically

52
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:55,869
makes your system immune to the current

53
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:57,460
versions of the malware so yeah so

54
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:59,590
here's a basic guide a special windows 7

55
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:00,910
environment it's a tackled vm so it

56
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:02,470
doesn't know that it's a virtual machine

57
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:03,580
it thinks it's a physical machine and

58
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:05,350
anything that's installed on it also

59
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:07,330
believes that so it also included I a

60
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:08,769
pro some unpacking software and

61
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:10,840
injectors and if you guys want any more

62
00:02:08,769 --> 00:02:12,940
of the technical details I can go into

63
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,319
that a little bit later and yeah to stop

64
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:17,829
by our booth and I'll definitely talk to

65
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,299
about it so tested on which ransomware

66
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:20,950
did I test out so there was the new

67
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,830
custom variants of Sam Sam that was in

68
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:25,549
2016 I went back did about seven

69
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:27,380
variants of cryptolocker

70
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:29,990
aight aight variants of crypto wall i

71
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:32,269
did two variants of allah ki then i did

72
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:35,330
a couple of the older versions of crypto

73
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:36,890
wall so yeah data what basically I'm

74
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:38,600
gonna go over what caused the malware to

75
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:40,279
start evolving because this is the

76
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,040
actual weakness in the malware that

77
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,390
we're actually taking advantage of so so

78
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,670
the sum of the next generation security

79
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:47,799
wall features I can't there's tons of

80
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,579
them out there but they actually have

81
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,750
advanced feature sets where they will

82
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,780
actually spin up a virtual machine and

83
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:55,190
actually install the software see what

84
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,720
it's calling upon things like that so

85
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,740
it's actually in a security environment

86
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,359
it's looking to see if it's something

87
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,710
delicious and that's something that the

88
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,810
actual malware designers have started

89
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:04,970
putting features in there for detecting

90
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:06,640
virtual machines things the things of

91
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:09,020
that nature some of them have very

92
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,459
distinct signatures so it's something

93
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,920
where the actual now and where

94
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:15,170
manufacturers are actually putting that

95
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,510
into their actual droppers so and that's

96
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:18,500
one of the ways that for example all

97
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,340
three that creators on the left or

98
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,500
infected because there are physical

99
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:24,890
machines they had some of the things

100
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:28,400
true that weren't true so and basically

101
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:30,589
I got the malware last year on new years

102
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,200
or so actually Christmas I got the email

103
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:34,760
I checked it on New Year's but uh yeah

104
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,310
one of my buddies actually he runs a

105
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,989
triple disposable mail service I met him

106
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:41,209
at defcon 18 he's a very interesting

107
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:42,230
fellow so but yeah I get excited every

108
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:45,560
time he sends me an email because it's

109
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:47,030
usually malware so be friends like I

110
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,709
saying he runs at a self-destructing

111
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,650
service on tour so he comes across a lot

112
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:53,239
of custom malware a lot of the Packers

113
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:55,340
things like that and I actually sold a

114
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:57,500
he sold me this one for a billion disk

115
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:59,000
so does anybody play eve online or has

116
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,980
played EVE Online it's a yeah the

117
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,010
currency of the game so i got it for a

118
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:05,959
pretty good deal so and there's some

119
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:07,519
what called industrial control software

120
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:08,870
that he also sent me and i'm going to be

121
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,640
doing white paper and some research on

122
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:12,470
in october here so but it's actually

123
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,238
looking at a well site information and

124
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:17,358
it looks like it yeah it's gonna be

125
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:19,040
pretty interesting research so and yeah

126
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,450
so softwares the service everybody that

127
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,310
was a buzzword two years three years ago

128
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:23,539
so and it's now something that the

129
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:25,280
malware manufacturers are doing for

130
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:28,550
about around fifty dollars you can

131
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,140
launch your own campaigns using their

132
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:32,030
actual tool kits and some of their

133
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:33,710
actual web portals so it's something you

134
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:36,650
actually have technical support so if

135
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:38,510
anybody has problems procuring bitcoins

136
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:40,190
or things like that they actually are

137
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:42,409
pretty decent I never thought there'd be

138
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:44,750
a day where we actually have a technical

139
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:46,220
support for malware so that's pretty

140
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:48,140
interesting but I'm going a little bit

141
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,520
of the toolkits like there's the angler

142
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:51,409
toolkit there's some other ones that are

143
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,690
actually off for sale on the black on

144
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:55,880
the dark web in the actual black market

145
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:58,250
and that's a pretty booming industry

146
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,659
they are the estimations at a bed of

147
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,250
mine are somewhere around I think it was

148
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,960
like 40 million dollars a year the other

149
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:05,300
up to like three and a half million a

150
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,039
month based off of the actual reversing

151
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,870
of the actual bitcoins in the crypto

152
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,130
ransoms so or that actual ransoms that

153
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:13,040
I've been paid on the cryptolocker and

154
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:15,020
some of the other ones so yeah and

155
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,580
basically what is the dropper pretty

156
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,450
much everybody here should should have a

157
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,770
little bit of knowledge of it it's

158
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,270
basically the snow plow that comes

159
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:22,400
before the bus it's something that is a

160
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:24,409
quick and actually pulls down the rest

161
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,940
of the malware these signatures on these

162
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:28,280
literally change our early I've seen I

163
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:29,480
literally wasted the time pulling it

164
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,830
apart the second time I wanted to see it

165
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,540
was the same program it just was packed

166
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:34,159
differently or it had a different

167
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,720
obfuscation applied to it so it didn't

168
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,270
have the same signature in the antivirus

169
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:41,270
see ristic engines which are usually 66

170
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:42,440
hours at the very best behind so that's

171
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:44,180
something where the battler droppers are

172
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,770
actually they're staying ahead of the

173
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:49,580
actual curve on this kind of stuff so

174
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:50,900
and yeah here's a look at payloads this

175
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,640
was a malware that I came across a

176
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,620
couple months ago it actually ruins a

177
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:57,740
perfectly good windows 7 installation so

178
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:59,090
I know this actual on the Malheur what

179
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,730
the actual payload is is what the actual

180
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:03,049
malware does so it's something that a

181
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:04,430
yeah that's the payload then the dropper

182
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:07,640
is actually the one that pulls the

183
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:09,410
entire malware onto the system so and

184
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,820
yet here's a what the payload for the

185
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,410
actual cryptolocker is it looks for a

186
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,990
lot of these kind of file extensions

187
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:16,820
some of them actually prioritized by

188
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:18,500
size things like that like Sam Sam does

189
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,700
a very good job of actually creating a

190
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,600
list of what it's going to encrypt first

191
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,610
because it knows it's going to get

192
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,590
caught you know forty fifty percent

193
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:27,440
through its assuming it will buy some

194
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:28,549
kind of ids or actual certain portions

195
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,670
when it starts spinning up some of the

196
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:33,980
program so but the actual droppers they

197
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:35,390
yeah here's some of the advanced here I

198
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:37,090
stuck math or the methods that they're

199
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:39,650
doing for as far as obfuscating the code

200
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:41,330
this one's kind of a joke but it's yeah

201
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:43,669
they're using the exact same features

202
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:46,070
that people are using on the wild so

203
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:47,540
it's something where yeah like actual

204
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,770
software companies there isn't pretty

205
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,920
much the exact same professionally

206
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:53,549
tailored

207
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:57,060
anti anti piracy and anti install

208
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:58,830
solutions so well yes so this basically

209
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,720
my first concept i'm gonna go over is

210
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:02,460
actually attacking the dropper and this

211
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,960
one was a one that was built into a file

212
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:07,710
extension that is usually emailed people

213
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:09,870
and as you can see it passed this virus

214
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:11,250
signature it did pass on virustotal i

215
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:13,470
think there was one one flag on

216
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:16,860
virustotal but that was about two years

217
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:18,120
or but not two years 22 hours old so the

218
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,790
actual hair stick engine did not

219
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,560
actually detect that so so I'm going to

220
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:23,190
go into the first concept on this so is

221
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,510
everybody have a pretty good

222
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,770
understanding of what the actual malware

223
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,860
does how its pulled onto the system

224
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:30,539
everybody here has heard of cryptolocker

225
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:32,480
ransomware in general so the first

226
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:35,370
actual one is called Old Yeller and

227
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,600
basically why this works is the dropper

228
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:38,250
every single one of the droppers i was

229
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:41,310
looking at they actually kill watchdog

230
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:43,200
programs so that's something where ya

231
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:45,000
and Weavin seed Old Yeller it's

232
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,370
basically a good story of a boy and his

233
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,080
dog and all the antivirus watch dogs are

234
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:51,180
actually the process that restarts the

235
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,609
antivirus if the antivirus is killed so

236
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,930
when the actual watchdog is killed most

237
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:56,910
of the time it's something that it can't

238
00:07:54,930 --> 00:08:00,060
restart itself so I've actually created

239
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:01,980
a process that is basically a fake

240
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,900
antivirus watchdog I attacked it to an

241
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:06,720
intentional intentional kernel panic you

242
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:09,179
can do in the registry and basically

243
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,830
when the watchdog is kill or when the

244
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,510
actual watchdog process is killed it'll

245
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:14,609
actually intentionally blue-screen the

246
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:15,840
computer so you've effectively stopped

247
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:17,520
malware from being pulled down on your

248
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,070
network and this is actually attacking

249
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,210
the pet are the actual dropper it's not

250
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,469
actually looking for any signature

251
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:24,270
information this is if it's already

252
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:26,250
gotten past your antivirus and some of

253
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,330
your other data so this will

254
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,460
intentionally blue screen if you have

255
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:30,659
that user that will go back through with

256
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:33,240
their computer backup you can actually

257
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:35,360
have the actual crash log copy over the

258
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,560
hibernation file and it'll actually a

259
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,940
soft brick the computer so you have to

260
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:41,760
actually pull into IT because I've seen

261
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:43,080
where people will literally after they

262
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,039
got infected once they'll go back into

263
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,820
the email because it didn't work

264
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:50,310
correctly so what you have the software

265
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:52,290
method to is keats Keats's my cat when I

266
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:53,819
was growing up so that's why I named it

267
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:56,189
after him in honor of him and it's a

268
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,600
basically a program like i was saying a

269
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:59,280
lot of those systems are looking for

270
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,680
Santa of sandbox environments and

271
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,180
they'll actually stop themselves so what

272
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,189
I did was take took about the malware

273
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:06,780
came across several of the methods that

274
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:08,370
it was looking for I was looking for

275
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:10,050
like machines that had over two gigs of

276
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:12,810
ram it would automatically go into

277
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:14,640
hibernation mode if it wasn't over 2

278
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:16,680
gigs of ram so there's a registries a

279
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,360
parts of there's actually a hex you can

280
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,430
change inside your operating system to

281
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,690
make like even like a 32 gigabyte system

282
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:23,849
like this look like it has two gigs of

283
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:25,380
ram so that was one of the very very

284
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:27,210
simple first methods that I came up with

285
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,560
and I did get it working I worked on

286
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:30,990
about seventy percent of the malware out

287
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,969
there that I was testing so there are

288
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:34,830
certain registries and flags and there

289
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:36,510
was also i added a false debugger

290
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:38,640
presence so i made it look like there

291
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:40,220
was a debugger installed so and that was

292
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,150
one of things where i was able to stop

293
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:44,940
literally seventy percent of the malware

294
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:46,920
that i was looking at earlier so and

295
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,750
here's software method to it's called

296
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:51,660
emo and it basically gets malware to

297
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:53,820
kill itself so it's a pretty decent not

298
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,170
only the full version of the malware it

299
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,750
makes it basically makes it kill itself

300
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:59,040
it's lowers your ram down 1.5 gigabytes

301
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,660
and that's how you can actually

302
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,540
physically use your entirety of your ram

303
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:05,520
it installs fake vmware tools it also

304
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,349
installs fake debuggers then there are

305
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,270
five sandbox environments that it adds

306
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:11,120
registry keys stuff like that to make it

307
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:13,560
look like it's a fully virtualized

308
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,810
environment that the malware does not

309
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:17,400
want to unpack itself into so that's

310
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:18,869
something we're making these changes to

311
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,699
the registry it literally killed one

312
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:21,750
hundred percent i wish i could say 99.9

313
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,280
i wish they would have been one that

314
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:25,470
would a you know gave me a little bit of

315
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,339
a fight on it and it literally every

316
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:28,260
single one of them about there being

317
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:30,810
dissected and it actually protected the

318
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:32,370
computer and this too had no impact for

319
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:35,420
as far as the testing that I did for in

320
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:38,010
as far as in a production environment so

321
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:39,990
and yeah I will be releasing these tools

322
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:42,420
in August and some of these are very

323
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:43,890
very simple as far as a anybody's access

324
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:45,630
to a hex editor you can do one of the

325
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:48,560
first methods that I was speaking about

326
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:51,120
so as far as changing your actual ram so

327
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,619
and here's the hardware method who's

328
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,620
ever seen those really good deals on

329
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:57,750
ebay like for a 256 gigabyte SD card for

330
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,100
like eight dollars yeah they're not

331
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,380
really that it's actually an eight

332
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,970
gigabyte with yeah with a copyright

333
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:05,040
infringement too low going and all that

334
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:06,660
jazz but basically what it does is has a

335
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,120
hack table of content on it so you can

336
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,890
actually it looks like you can load 256

337
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,140
gigabytes of information on it but it

338
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:15,510
actually starts copying over itself and

339
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,710
it just holds the toc contents of the

340
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,819
actual card so

341
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:20,160
this is one of the methods when I

342
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:22,950
actually started generating fake mp3s

343
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,449
fakin befores JPEGs things like that I

344
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:27,360
started out with very very small files

345
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:29,580
and once you fill the 200 feet 60

346
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,040
gigabyte draw disk with actual fake

347
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:33,900
files you can just ghost it over you can

348
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,750
just clone it over and make other ones

349
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:39,780
to run in other computers so basically i

350
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:41,040
procured it on ebay was 14 it was too

351
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:43,170
good to be true so that was something

352
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,670
that uh yeah then over on the left here

353
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:47,640
is verifying the data it does not verify

354
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:49,110
it basically copies on to the actual SD

355
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,670
card then it checks the integrity of the

356
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:52,170
files so that's something this is

357
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:54,300
definitely a hacked card and since it's

358
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:56,550
an actual half to USB card you can load

359
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,810
your own files on it and you can

360
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,310
randomly generate them in those file

361
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:02,099
extensions that I was looking at earlier

362
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:03,449
so if you fill it with random JPEGs mp4s

363
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:07,650
things like that it's actually going to

364
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:09,780
be a pretty cool process here so this

365
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:11,250
takes advance the parse order of the

366
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:12,720
actual ransomware so once you put this

367
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:15,030
SD card in your machine you give it the

368
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,460
a letter drive for the most part with

369
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:18,360
the exception of Sam Sam there was a

370
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:21,120
every single one of them went through

371
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,980
your a drive first be dr c drive d drive

372
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,750
then it went on to your online drives or

373
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,580
your shared drives and stuff like that

374
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:29,640
so that's something where if you throw

375
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:32,460
this SD card inside your system and you

376
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:34,860
mount it just give it your a a drive

377
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:36,570
it'll actually uh yeah you can actually

378
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:38,640
go above and beyond that with a some of

379
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:40,620
the 16 gigabyte ones so if you literally

380
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,840
fill this card with random data it's

381
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:44,640
going to tie the malware up I tied one

382
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,260
of the malware's up for 18 hours one

383
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,750
time it was on a pretty powerful machine

384
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:50,040
but I care abot workstation when it's

385
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,360
searching out some of these that'll

386
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,099
actually find the smallest ones first

387
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,680
we'll start encrypting them so that

388
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,510
gives you a lot of time for your actual

389
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:59,969
antivirus engine to get updated and also

390
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:01,980
it ties the malware up pretty heftily

391
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:02,910
and then also it also blue screens your

392
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,250
computer when it's about thirty percent

393
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:07,140
done because it literally takes

394
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:09,690
one-point-three percent of your CPU

395
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:11,460
utilization each cycle that it does so

396
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:12,600
that's something we're about like I said

397
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,940
about thirty-three percent through that

398
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,710
card and that's I'm selling with Sam Sam

399
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:18,510
even the more some of the more advanced

400
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:19,710
custom tailored ones it'll actually lock

401
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,819
the operating system up so you just

402
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:23,520
stopped your user from getting infected

403
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:24,900
just by having a happy USB plugged into

404
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:27,920
their system so there's no software you

405
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,920
need to run or anything so

406
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:32,700
and yeah hiding your files so basically

407
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,440
there's also backup systems the new

408
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:37,890
version of walkie actually deletes some

409
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:39,899
of your backup files so that's something

410
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:41,490
where or even your shadow folder system

411
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:43,800
folder stuff like that so you can

412
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:46,500
actually delete you can use a ship disk

413
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:48,420
utility so you can basically shift some

414
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,709
of your backups positions and stuff like

415
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:52,890
that and it'll actually put them in

416
00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:54,300
systems folders three out of the five

417
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:55,529
members we're looking at earlier don't

418
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,490
check into systems folders they don't

419
00:13:55,529 --> 00:13:58,290
want to lock up your operating system

420
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:59,760
which is basically what I was doing so

421
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:01,290
it's something where they try to stay

422
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,640
away from the actual systems files and

423
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:03,990
they stick to those file extensions they

424
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:06,870
know they don't want to start actually

425
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:08,339
interacting with systems files so that's

426
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:09,839
something we're that's a very very

427
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:11,160
simple one you can move some of the

428
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,920
shadow copies or you can actually delete

429
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,240
your shadow copies and not like I said

430
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,310
none of the ransomware I came across as

431
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,510
like a DoD wipe or a low-level format if

432
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:20,729
it's a solid state drive it would erase

433
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:25,290
it so and the DoD format is just the

434
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:27,029
three level pet or three passes so and

435
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:29,449
yeah here's the cryptolocker simulator

436
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:31,830
this is something I came up with after I

437
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:33,600
pulled the first version of it apart it

438
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,800
basically is a you can running for your

439
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,270
environment you can see where you open

440
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,149
reading rights are you can see what the

441
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:40,680
actual payloads were you can see see if

442
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:42,720
your antivirus would have caught some of

443
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,250
the more advanced features and this is

444
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,740
the original version of it you still

445
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:48,750
give this out as a like a value add on

446
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,680
pen tests so something where you know a

447
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,940
lot of especially in smaller

448
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,140
environments they didn't realize how

449
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:54,029
susceptible they were with some of their

450
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:56,189
open read rights or some of their

451
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:58,829
usernames passwords it there were some

452
00:14:56,190 --> 00:15:00,540
simple so this basically is a zoo form

453
00:14:58,829 --> 00:15:02,149
of the original version or it was

454
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:04,800
actually the second version of crypto

455
00:15:02,149 --> 00:15:06,510
cryptolocker so and this one was just

456
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,099
for simulation purposes so you can

457
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:09,480
actually test some of the call home

458
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,730
functionality which I'll go into here

459
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,740
and this is the actual 2 point 0 or the

460
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:15,480
framework that I have and this will also

461
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,829
be released in August and it's all open

462
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,300
source it's free you can feel free to

463
00:15:16,829 --> 00:15:20,130
play with our around with it as much as

464
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:22,260
you want and this testing framework

465
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:24,930
basically here's the list of the

466
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:27,029
functions it calls the post so it sends

467
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:29,459
posts sort of tries to call home it'll

468
00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:30,990
test some well-known bad servers see if

469
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:33,239
your actual firewalls going to catch it

470
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:35,910
you can search for open reading rights

471
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,740
you can test your backups against

472
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:39,420
encryption you can calculate your ransom

473
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:41,459
amounts of what they would have cost you

474
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:43,019
you can do a bait file

475
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:44,609
which is basically some of the

476
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:46,079
information from the malware's that I

477
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,519
pulled apart there are certain things

478
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,069
they'll grab off of your system

479
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,499
information to generate the key so at a

480
00:15:50,069 --> 00:15:54,420
later time or even at the current time

481
00:15:52,499 --> 00:15:56,790
you can actually pop some of that

482
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:58,709
information into a backup even if it's a

483
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:00,509
I've got it successfully working in up

484
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:02,309
to a three week old backup so if you

485
00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:04,829
generate that same functionality into

486
00:16:02,309 --> 00:16:06,300
those some of the changes do lock the

487
00:16:04,829 --> 00:16:07,679
operating system up so that like I said

488
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,209
it is a low likelihood and I'm still

489
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:12,059
going to be working on that but if you

490
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:13,800
actually roll those a key or those those

491
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:15,300
features into the actual backup you're

492
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,170
able to re-encrypt and then you like

493
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,599
most of the people that have actually

494
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:21,089
helped pay ransoms it was stuff where

495
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,050
they only need one file or two files so

496
00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:24,029
this is something where you can do your

497
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:26,128
free file then you can re-encrypt

498
00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:27,509
yourself and then actually have it go

499
00:16:26,129 --> 00:16:30,269
for the second file so that's something

500
00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:31,679
we're yeah and as far as keats and some

501
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:34,649
of the old yeller functionality in the

502
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:35,670
emo you can actually lock down some of

503
00:16:34,649 --> 00:16:36,959
that functionality so you can actually

504
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:39,990
control some of that stuff you can

505
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:42,149
modify it and it could pull down the

506
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:44,189
actual file systems the time of

507
00:16:42,149 --> 00:16:45,959
infection stuff like that so and you can

508
00:16:44,189 --> 00:16:47,429
download the downgrade the clock time

509
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:49,469
like I was saying and you can text your

510
00:16:47,429 --> 00:16:52,589
payload avoidance so that's something

511
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:54,029
where you can actually test the to see

512
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:55,679
if your virtual machine will be detected

513
00:16:54,029 --> 00:16:57,389
by different variants so that adds

514
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:59,129
functionality that malware researchers

515
00:16:57,389 --> 00:17:01,079
can actually put this one looks for this

516
00:16:59,129 --> 00:17:02,549
now or this now or this snow so that's

517
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:03,899
something we're above and beyond what

518
00:17:02,549 --> 00:17:06,689
I'm doing because I'm not a full time

519
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:08,520
mallar engineer something where I I do

520
00:17:06,689 --> 00:17:09,600
this a lot of my free time like I saying

521
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,579
the original thing it took me probably

522
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:13,168
two and a half two and a half weeks on

523
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:14,938
my free time so it's something where I

524
00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:16,289
think some of the professionals had it

525
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:18,329
tearing apart the day and a half later

526
00:17:16,289 --> 00:17:20,099
but they have an entire team so this is

527
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:21,809
something where you're basically adding

528
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:23,668
a kind of a signature but it's something

529
00:17:21,809 --> 00:17:25,309
that is attacking natural payloads and

530
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:27,000
the droppers instead of the actual

531
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:29,158
signature and stopping yourself from

532
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,960
getting infected so and that's something

533
00:17:29,159 --> 00:17:32,820
where I'm excited to see some of the

534
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,289
feedback first off from some of people

535
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:36,000
in the community and then also from the

536
00:17:34,289 --> 00:17:38,820
actual malware people because I did a

537
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,950
talk at Def Con last year and I did us

538
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:42,539
it actually injected fake credit card

539
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:44,789
numbers in the memory and then I've seen

540
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:46,289
actual some of the more recent versions

541
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:48,270
of the memory scrapers actually

542
00:17:46,289 --> 00:17:50,580
combating some of that type of features

543
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:52,770
so so it's pretty awesome to see you

544
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:54,240
know the actual industry taken effect

545
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:55,080
from it so I'm excited to see how the

546
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,519
actual malware

547
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,080
factors because this literally like i

548
00:17:56,519 --> 00:18:00,960
was saying stops a majority of the

549
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:03,059
actual malware that's out there and yeah

550
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,890
and here's the actual look at it and

551
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:06,750
with that resolution i always do a

552
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:08,850
blown-up version so like I was saying

553
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:10,500
you can test your post call home you can

554
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:12,149
actually test your backups so there's a

555
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,710
file extension if you want to you know

556
00:18:12,149 --> 00:18:15,120
see if your actual backup process is

557
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:18,600
working things like that calculate the

558
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,039
ransom you can check your domain on that

559
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,899
to see the likelihood there's no

560
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:23,879
feedback on the domain check to see if

561
00:18:21,899 --> 00:18:25,139
it's actually one that pays or actually

562
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,880
gives you the encryption keys when you

563
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,590
actually check it so this is pretty much

564
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,179
an entire framework to simulate or

565
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:31,740
emulate in your environment or your

566
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:33,330
customers environments where they can

567
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:35,730
actually see how they would be affected

568
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:37,019
by some of the more recent ransomware

569
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:39,240
and then they can also test some of

570
00:18:37,019 --> 00:18:40,860
their AV manufacturers to see if they

571
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,240
catch a lot of that stuff so because

572
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:45,120
these do have a lot of the features of

573
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:48,630
some of the antivirus so or of the

574
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,678
actual malware it's so so and yeah

575
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:51,510
here's one of the other ways i made a

576
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,340
it's a basically a file there's a couple

577
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:56,129
things i did an outlook plugin that is

578
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:57,570
halfway done that basically when a file

579
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:59,519
comes in if there's a way to do it in

580
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:01,559
outlook i was not able to find it where

581
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:03,559
you can basically save it in the older

582
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:05,789
version before macros are enabled for

583
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,809
certain users so it's something if you

584
00:19:05,789 --> 00:19:08,100
have that person that keeps clicking the

585
00:19:06,809 --> 00:19:09,990
spear phishing campaigns or if that's

586
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,639
the twice the second time it's kind of

587
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:13,529
maybe take that privilege away from them

588
00:19:11,639 --> 00:19:14,879
it's something where it sends a copy to

589
00:19:13,529 --> 00:19:16,080
their spam folder so they do the

590
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,850
original one if they needed to look at

591
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,168
it and you can actually roll internal

592
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:21,059
file extensions because when you install

593
00:19:19,169 --> 00:19:24,059
the the actual program that i have it's

594
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:25,440
a this ones with keys so once you

595
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:27,210
install keats it'll actually grab all

596
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,610
the file extensions that cryptolocker

597
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:32,039
goes for and it will actually obfuscate

598
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:34,139
them so it actually and as you can see

599
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:36,179
it's still associate some reassociate re

600
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:38,129
associates them with the actual programs

601
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:40,200
so and this does actually go into the

602
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:42,029
actual padding on the xml data of the

603
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,010
actual files so that was the next step

604
00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:45,720
if i was a malware manufacturer i would

605
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:48,899
actually start looking deeper into some

606
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,250
of the files so but yeah so you can

607
00:19:48,899 --> 00:19:52,080
basically roll your own internal

608
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,909
extensions like these used to be JPEGs

609
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,620
and you know that other one is the

610
00:19:53,909 --> 00:19:56,880
powerpoint presentation so it's

611
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:58,320
something where you can actually have

612
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,789
your own custom file extension so if

613
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,529
something comes from the outside it'll

614
00:19:59,789 --> 00:20:04,139
immediately grabbed by one of the swamp

615
00:20:01,529 --> 00:20:05,549
files so and then it'll actually if you

616
00:20:04,139 --> 00:20:07,199
want to have an internal file structure

617
00:20:05,549 --> 00:20:08,940
you could actually roll this internally

618
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,560
inside of a we're actually talking

619
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,420
earlier how hard it would be to actually

620
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:14,460
do this in a larger environment 75 users

621
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:16,110
yes all day long but what about 20

622
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,520
thousand users stuff like that and this

623
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:19,530
is where it might be tailored for

624
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,090
certain certain parts or certain

625
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:22,320
divisions of the company and you can

626
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:25,020
actually have an internal file structure

627
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,970
which can change daily that's what mine

628
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:28,650
actually does not on this computer but

629
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:30,240
it actually evolves daily so it'd be

630
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:34,040
hard to stay on top of what the actual

631
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:40,760
randomly generated file extensions be so

632
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:40,760
and yeah is there any questions so yes

633
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:53,380
things like that kind of emulate virtual

634
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:55,059
environment or a regular now are you

635
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:56,200
worried about self-destruct to tell

636
00:20:55,059 --> 00:21:02,530
where the ones that when they detect

637
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:03,850
that rather than just stop yeah and

638
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,750
that's one of the things that I started

639
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:05,980
looking at right at the end there

640
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,510
because like some of them are the self

641
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:09,760
destructing malware and that's why I

642
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:10,990
attack at the dropper level because that

643
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,429
was one of the things one some hours

644
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:14,770
like you're saying some of them they

645
00:21:12,429 --> 00:21:16,690
will you know try being didn't seen ones

646
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:17,830
I go after your Ida pro key so like it's

647
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:20,620
something where you're getting attacked

648
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:22,570
on that basis so something we're yeah

649
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:23,889
totally this is that's why I'm trying to

650
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:26,889
stop it at that level of the actual

651
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:28,809
dropper and that's where as far as the

652
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:30,130
other that'd be awesome to check into

653
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:31,270
some of the actual experience for some

654
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:33,190
of them but yeah some of the actual

655
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:34,480
payload for some of that stuff I haven't

656
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:36,490
looked too much do you know which

657
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:44,760
variant did some of the more destructive

658
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:44,760
stuff okay

659
00:21:47,929 --> 00:21:53,809
yep awesome yeah it's kind of the same

660
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,860
thing because the original version the

661
00:21:53,809 --> 00:21:57,590
first two versions equipped a locker

662
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:58,820
somebody handed me the TOEFL pulled

663
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:00,289
apart versions and the rest of them I

664
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,759
did myself but yeah I didn't look that

665
00:22:00,289 --> 00:22:03,619
deeply into some of the destructive

666
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:06,049
payloads of it so and some of those are

667
00:22:03,619 --> 00:22:07,249
really really easy to flag but if

668
00:22:06,049 --> 00:22:09,470
they've already taken down the watchdog

669
00:22:07,249 --> 00:22:11,570
nav that's something we're yeah there's

670
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:13,340
nothing left to stop it so what yeah i

671
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:14,509
think is as far as being put in a series

672
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:16,549
with this that would definitely stop

673
00:22:14,509 --> 00:22:18,230
some of this and yeah there's no there's

674
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:20,389
no way better to block this other than

675
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:21,769
to have proper backups to and that's a

676
00:22:20,389 --> 00:22:24,830
huge problem up in the Midwest where I

677
00:22:21,769 --> 00:22:26,860
live up in North Dakota so so any other

678
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,860
questions

679
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:40,690
sweet um well most of its compiled and

680
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:41,860
see but you have to any time you reverse

681
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:44,740
engineer anything you usually have to do

682
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:46,510
it in an assembly so x86 assembly then

683
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:49,210
some of the phone stuff would be based

684
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:50,890
in an arm assembly so and yeah it's it's

685
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:52,450
a yeah you guys have a little bit of a

686
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:53,770
background in programming it's

687
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:56,260
definitely something once you get into

688
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:58,180
but we're familiar with see it's pretty

689
00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:00,070
simple to are not simple but and

690
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:01,810
nothing's ever simple about assembly but

691
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:03,340
it's something we're dia you can

692
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:06,580
definitely go back into some of the more

693
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:07,810
lower level languages so yeah but yeah

694
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:10,330
that's as far as that goes it's all

695
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:11,740
mostly if you didn't see or in the there

696
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:13,540
are some comments and stuff liking pull

697
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:16,420
out of some of the higher level stuff so

698
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:21,940
his answer your question okay awesome

699
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:26,170
yes I have seen a couple of them there's

700
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:28,240
a couple sees oh the question was is a

701
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:30,490
scene mobile ransomware and I have seen

702
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,780
a couple for that were this is like a

703
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:33,700
year or two ago I didn't actually get

704
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:36,490
copies of them but they were going after

705
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:38,470
unlocked android i forgot the actual

706
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:40,570
distro or the version of android but

707
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:42,880
there has been a couple of them that do

708
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:44,620
premium toll services they have some of

709
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,870
them that run botnets for as far as

710
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:48,850
stuff like that so but yeah as far as

711
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:50,080
the actual i have i have caught caught

712
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:52,389
wind of some of the actual ones that are

713
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,620
actual ransom based ones so first of our

714
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,880
strong systems i haven't actually looked

715
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:56,889
into the validity of those or got

716
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:01,470
samples of them so they be definitely

717
00:23:56,890 --> 00:24:01,470
something to check into though so yes o

718
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:07,840
0 for android i believe their their

719
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:09,820
specific exploit that they took

720
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,139
advantage of was with rooted devices or

721
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,669
unattached devices and i don't remember

722
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:15,370
the manufacturers or the actual distro

723
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:16,600
but so but yeah that was one that was

724
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:18,100
one of the biggest things at DEFCON it

725
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,080
used to be so awesome you know it mean

726
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:21,490
that everybody wrote your phone like

727
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,080
don't tell us what to put on our phones

728
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:25,600
and then i'll send it's like we need to

729
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:28,300
use security updates like please patch

730
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,620
them quick verizon you know so there's

731
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,480
been a total shift in that kind of stuff

732
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:33,760
and yeah yeah but as far as some of that

733
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:36,220
actual malware for sores i've been

734
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,840
looking at a lot of ATM malware recently

735
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:40,480
that's been going pretty crazy i know

736
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,770
some gentleman down at a security

737
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,100
conference did a really good talk on

738
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,270
that

739
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:45,668
recently some excited for those videos

740
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:46,929
to come out but yeah like I said I don't

741
00:24:45,669 --> 00:24:48,669
pull it apart full time but this is

742
00:24:46,929 --> 00:24:50,049
something we're in a couple of iron

743
00:24:48,669 --> 00:24:51,100
ments it worked really really good and

744
00:24:50,049 --> 00:24:52,299
I'm excited to see how the community

745
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:59,699
plays off of it and some of the feedback

746
00:24:52,299 --> 00:24:59,700
so yeah any other questions yes

747
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:18,900
yep like I said about tackled I don't

748
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,070
know whatever there's some other if you

749
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:22,710
actually read some of that like there's

750
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:24,720
very very good like their Sam's courses

751
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:26,460
on pulling apart malware so there's like

752
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,260
very very good research on actually

753
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,700
setting up those sandbox environments

754
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,800
and like that's not saying some of these

755
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,000
triggers like a look for specific you

756
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,169
know parts and registry and things like

757
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,970
that so it's something we're from that

758
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:38,550
point on if you want to actually set it

759
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:40,050
up like like my one that I roll is like

760
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:41,730
I take other some other people's

761
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:43,770
concepts and other people's parts but as

762
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:45,810
far as that goes it's yes setting up

763
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:47,760
from scratch and then I just snapshot

764
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:48,780
reverted so as far as that goes and then

765
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,980
you have to set off you have to

766
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,840
segregate also some of the network

767
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:54,540
functionality you don't want it going

768
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,070
into production network so I would touch

769
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:57,690
it with a very fine grain of salt

770
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:58,620
because it's something we're soon as I

771
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:00,120
start playing with malware it's

772
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:03,389
amazingly fun and it's fun seeing it

773
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:05,159
react to such simple processes too so

774
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:07,500
it's something where if you want to get

775
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,610
into the reversing malware perfect ones

776
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:11,010
to start out on or some of the old

777
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:14,340
big-name ones like my first one ever

778
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:16,110
there was a chair noble or CA h or c CH

779
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:17,820
the chernobyl virus it's the one that

780
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:19,560
actually rewrote your bios on your

781
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:21,389
computer so and some of those really

782
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:23,429
really old ones are very simple to pull

783
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:26,280
apart with modern debuggers and actual

784
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:27,570
reversing tools so so i would highly

785
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,040
recommend that and it's really really

786
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:31,169
fun if you're looking for a cheap hobby

787
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:33,899
you know it's like this it's very cheap

788
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:35,820
so just literally got to click a couple

789
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:41,960
ads and you're getting your own free

790
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:41,960
malware so yeah yeah so quick just

791
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:54,160
um for over as far as a as far as

792
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:56,230
malware goes uh I did have a fringe

793
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:59,350
there's a kind of a fringe idea where in

794
00:26:56,230 --> 00:27:01,720
it's actually having basically

795
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:05,230
installing a hypervisor then using Class

796
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:08,470
D in class II IP addresses which every

797
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:09,970
single operating system and tool known

798
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:13,110
to man will drop that kind of traffic

799
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:15,760
like I had even a hard time getting

800
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:16,719
Wireshark to even listen to IP addresses

801
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,010
that were coming from that range so

802
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,050
that's something where there I've done

803
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:22,360
that over GRE tunnels on DMV are dynamic

804
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:23,649
multi-point VPNs so like the actual

805
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,419
traffic if anybody tried to sniff it out

806
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:29,380
like literally as soon as we get out of

807
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:30,460
its a sandbox we'd 0 WR RT router so it

808
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:32,260
would actually pass because it literally

809
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:34,420
everything is taught with the exception

810
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:36,010
of some very fringe equipment and some

811
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:38,350
broadcast equipment everything else will

812
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:39,850
plant drop the class D and E space so

813
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:41,800
that's something we're on a network

814
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:44,080
level that is something we did look at

815
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:45,610
and that was a field pipeline

816
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,810
implementation that we were looking at

817
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:48,250
some of that I don't know what ever

818
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:50,950
happened with the actual process of that

819
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:52,510
so but that's on a network level you can

820
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:53,650
trick it into there are certain things

821
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:56,620
where you can call it into black holes

822
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:58,720
and there are some actual tools out

823
00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:00,040
there and firewalls and some of the next

824
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,110
generation functionality that can

825
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:04,360
actually stop some of the actual

826
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:06,010
processes like I was saying but some of

827
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,030
them will actually let it through so and

828
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:09,129
that those are some of the sandbox

829
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:10,960
there's 05 sandbox environments that I

830
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:12,490
looked for what the actual Malraux is

831
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,350
looking for and actually simulated those

832
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:16,330
on a physical to machine and it's

833
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:17,590
literally uh some of them aren't

834
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:18,909
supposed to even exist on a window

835
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:21,189
system like some of them are calling for

836
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:23,020
Windows or Linux functionality so it's

837
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:24,850
something we're yeah this is totally on

838
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:26,860
the actual pc basis of it or on the

839
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:30,520
actual computer end of it so is that

840
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:35,409
answer your question ok awesome and any

841
