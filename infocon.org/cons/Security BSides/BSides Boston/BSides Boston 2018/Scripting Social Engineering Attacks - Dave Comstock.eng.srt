1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,299
all right we got Dave Comstock here with

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:08,340
us Dave currently is with tripwire and

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:09,900
if when you if you want I think it's

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,629
very very entertaining

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:15,750
go read Dave's file and put down

6
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,190
particular what I like is he actually he

7
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,400
actually mentions the fact he's going to

8
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:22,140
admit to it that he had an IBM XT that's

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,759
kind of what going back there

10
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,400
but what I really liked about it was he

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,439
actually he actually talked about

12
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,820
abusing his equipment now this is the

13
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,759
same guy who's going to talk to us right

14
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,559
now about social engineering right okay

15
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:38,370
so I think I think he's speaking from

16
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:49,019
experience that right all right here

17
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:50,940
Dave all yours okay all right so so

18
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,620
thanks for coming um today we're going

19
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,210
to talk about social engineering let's

20
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,160
just take a real quick mint thanks at

21
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,780
that or this great event so far but that

22
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,010
a lot of good talks up block leaking

23
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,780
villages cool I'm not gonna you guys

24
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,670
went to that you can find me on the

25
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,119
steno deco-style and that's leet speak

26
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:08,939
so to zero I also on Twitter and

27
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:11,640
Mastodon the same exact thing so this

28
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:13,470
presentation is going to be I did a lot

29
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,820
of studying of recent interesting

30
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,590
attacks that I'd seen in social

31
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,029
engineering going from the DEF CON you

32
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,549
know social engineering capture the

33
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,830
flags and general clothes from popular

34
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:25,500
media Twitter post stuff like that and I

35
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:27,420
wanted to find a framework for social

36
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,009
engineering because I'm gonna I liked

37
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,380
framework Smith it's just one of those

38
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:34,560
things that they're nice you know they

39
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,970
help you streamline things and social

40
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,890
anomie --rings very relative it's very

41
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,689
it's very hard to plan it it's not you

42
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:43,140
can't just have like a set in stone way

43
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:44,429
of doing things so you know another good

44
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,590
thing about it is I don't like going

45
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,240
microwavable food instruction guides you

46
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,890
know there's not like a oh dude this

47
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,500
abuse this bias and all of a sudden

48
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,890
you'll be under the most bad guy on the

49
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:58,619
planet

50
00:01:52,890 --> 00:02:00,390
not really so script all the things

51
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:02,640
right and I tried coming up with this

52
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,860
little acronym for it and everyone will

53
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,530
action in acronyms so we're going to

54
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:10,080
streamline fishing fishing and physical

55
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:12,459
gave me physical access personal PvP and

56
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,000
then we're going to do it by tech I see

57
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:19,480
now the clowns no clown hate here okay

58
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,849
so set up pvp by tagging ivy what the

59
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:24,010
heck is I see that's bottom plate and

60
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:26,260
these are the three general areas that

61
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:28,780
I've found that most social engineers

62
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:30,340
attacks that seem to be effective take

63
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:33,010
advantage of so it's personally like

64
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:34,510
sanity and the identity come down to you

65
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:36,040
want to assume their role as much as

66
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:38,319
possible so if you're going to pretend

67
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,328
to be you know a construction worker

68
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,439
you're going to have one clothes

69
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:43,299
you're not going to have the new clothes

70
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:44,290
obviously you're going to have no tools

71
00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:45,849
you're gonna have certain tool you're

72
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,138
gonna have calloused hands maybe there's

73
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:48,369
gonna be all kinds of weird little

74
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:50,379
details you need to pay attention to

75
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,609
you're going to have certain logos and

76
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:52,870
insignia so if you work for a circle

77
00:02:51,609 --> 00:02:54,220
company you're going to have a certain

78
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:57,099
logo on your back on your jacket

79
00:02:54,220 --> 00:03:00,730
stuff like that method acting this is a

80
00:02:57,099 --> 00:03:02,619
famous klasky he was a he was an active

81
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,909
back in the day and he made this was

82
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,900
custom thing and he said you know one of

83
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:07,388
the best things to do is just people

84
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:10,269
watch so you just go out watch people

85
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:12,069
patron some details of the situation and

86
00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:15,400
you can kind of use that to build your

87
00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:16,720
character so culture jargon standard

88
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,370
operating procedure if you're going to

89
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,260
be trying to fish someone you're going

90
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,849
to want to focus on call Hamiltons if

91
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,510
you're going to be trying to trick a

92
00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:24,310
tech-support

93
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:26,530
baiting they're going to have Reedus

94
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:28,209
batteries so Dell for instance I I work

95
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:29,739
with though a lot and one of the ways

96
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:31,209
I've gotten their customer service reps

97
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:33,579
to stop giving me crap and I want

98
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:35,079
something done as I say I've done all of

99
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:37,479
this I give them all the information

100
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:39,250
they asked I said all the revisions or

101
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:41,259
you know the newest all the firmwares

102
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,699
are great blah blah blah because one of

103
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:45,369
the new things they have isn't already

104
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:47,290
are read this stature eight and if they

105
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:49,209
had to send a check out a second time

106
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:51,189
the person on the phone gets a negative

107
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:53,500
mark for that so of course that's going

108
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:56,709
to be one of the main things and then

109
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,720
again psychology cognitive biases and

110
00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:01,959
just out of curiosity how many of you

111
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:06,090
guys like mr. Rogers a couple of you

112
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:09,370
okay have you ever seen this Pope I

113
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:12,159
always look through the helpers okay

114
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:13,269
well that's a great quote but not quite

115
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,659
for the reason you might first expect

116
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:19,659
and I really like the Satanic mr. Rogers

117
00:04:16,659 --> 00:04:23,529
in the corner those were pretty pretty

118
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:25,360
prime so and you know even Charles

119
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:27,310
finishing here he says you know

120
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,860
my DMX four friend he says people are

121
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:32,020
primed to help we want to help not even

122
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:34,900
corporate corporate policy sometimes

123
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:37,479
it's driven into them from almost every

124
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:39,489
angle so the most and there was actually

125
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:41,740
a cool article I'm going to bring it up

126
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:43,599
a little later but the title of it was a

127
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,250
hackers best friend is a helpful

128
00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:48,938
employee and that's almost always true

129
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:51,099
so we're gonna start real simple here

130
00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:52,840
and this is a popular social media post

131
00:04:51,099 --> 00:04:54,969
from a little while back just back in

132
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:57,280
December and it deals with wearing a

133
00:04:54,969 --> 00:04:59,680
high visiting to just three events

134
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,500
concerts you know backstage that's like

135
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,940
that something intense but you know what

136
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,469
it really relies on is two things

137
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:07,479
there's a psychologist called Ralph

138
00:05:05,469 --> 00:05:10,690
Linton and he has different steps

139
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:13,870
scribed versus achieved so ascribe

140
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:16,779
status says well I'm sitting here with

141
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:18,879
my cute little speaker behead and that

142
00:05:16,779 --> 00:05:21,099
makes me speak that makes me an expert

143
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:22,870
of some kind I submitted to the CFP I

144
00:05:21,099 --> 00:05:25,740
got accepted obviously I had an idea

145
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:27,789
what I'm talking about right now but

146
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,009
that's the ascribes dance now the

147
00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:31,659
achieve status is what I achieved if

148
00:05:30,009 --> 00:05:33,400
after you sit here listen to my talk

149
00:05:31,659 --> 00:05:36,210
okay that kid Sally what he knows what

150
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:39,159
he's talking about maybe I'll do that

151
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:40,448
and I also uses authority bias and this

152
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:42,849
is pretty common you guys probably

153
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:44,349
already know it and what happens is you

154
00:05:42,849 --> 00:05:46,419
automatically trust a respect authority

155
00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:48,729
figures so if you're going to a concert

156
00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:50,859
event you see a guy wearing a security

157
00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:52,210
vest you instantly think that guy

158
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,740
security you're not really going to

159
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:55,930
think well let's check let's make sure

160
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:59,949
let's call his manager right not gonna

161
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:03,729
happen and this one was a presentation

162
00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:05,680
by a so close employee from ipx4 2016

163
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:06,490
and basically what he did was he took a

164
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,139
letter around

165
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:10,000
he took a ladder tried to look like a

166
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:12,099
maintenance worker and they've got led

167
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,500
him to so many places he was all a

168
00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:16,719
surprised and again this is a really

169
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,639
really simple example so imagine having

170
00:06:16,719 --> 00:06:20,050
a little bit more complexity to that

171
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,050
situation and you're going to get into a

172
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:25,120
lot more places so now again back when I

173
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,529
started here I like the frameworks I

174
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,229
like the framers because they're modular

175
00:06:26,529 --> 00:06:34,080
they're not microwave food sets right so

176
00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:37,810
how many guys apply Legos mmm good Mady

177
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:41,200
so I came up with this TNT and so

178
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:43,930
African goes PvP by attacking ICP with

179
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:46,180
Chanti okay and the TMT I cheated a

180
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:48,100
little bit and instead of an a types and

181
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:49,630
tactics right so I'm not going to read

182
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,580
the slides onto you but there's five

183
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:52,719
general types I came across and the

184
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,219
first one I support staff this one's

185
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,590
pretty broad there's gonna be IT

186
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:58,510
painters construction workers cleaning

187
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:00,549
staff you know any kind of support work

188
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:03,219
at all and then there's four different

189
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:04,570
sort of sub groups that could fall under

190
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,850
support but they're really their own

191
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:08,590
kind of thing and then I also want to go

192
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:10,630
over a couple of different tactics so

193
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:13,359
abusing self-interest using tools

194
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:15,340
paperwork things like that using Osen

195
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,510
open source information cliches and

196
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,520
banner to kind of guide the conversation

197
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:20,110
and maybe misdirecting with they're not

198
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:24,700
trusting you things like that and

199
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:27,070
abusing cognitive biases that so the

200
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:29,320
first part is abusing self interest and

201
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:30,909
as you can see from Dale Carnegie up

202
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,710
there he says you can make a lot more

203
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:34,150
friends by being interested in others

204
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:36,190
and trying to get them interested in you

205
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:38,049
so it's just one of those things where

206
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:39,729
it's a pretty universal thing

207
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:40,930
and there's a quote from a book called

208
00:07:39,729 --> 00:07:42,430
like what we got where it says welcome

209
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:44,080
like obiga where all the women are

210
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:45,520
strong all the men are good-looking and

211
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,770
all the children are above average

212
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,930
that kind of describe is how most people

213
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:51,039
view themselves you're never the outlier

214
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:52,600
you're never the below average

215
00:07:51,039 --> 00:08:00,130
right you're always at least a little

216
00:07:52,600 --> 00:08:03,310
bit about so tools on paper work and

217
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:05,650
this is going to be you know you can do

218
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:07,419
Osen obviously but if you see the badge

219
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:09,039
there you go on LinkedIn there's a lion

220
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:10,750
piglet LinkedIn open networking and

221
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,460
people will literally just follow you

222
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,110
back so openly let you to the network

223
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:16,960
they don't care and then people will

224
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:18,910
post employee badges on I'll say oh I

225
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,440
finally got my dream job I'm so happy

226
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:22,240
and it's like a picture of their

227
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:24,219
employee badge okay that probably

228
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:28,240
shouldn't be on the internet guys I just

229
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:30,280
want to say so again tools and you know

230
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,930
they should show wear and tear again and

231
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,338
again the general idea is that you want

232
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:34,690
to disarm people you want to get

233
00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:36,400
something looking at you and saying that

234
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:38,440
guy looks like a carpenter he doesn't

235
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:41,468
look like an IT guy right good that's

236
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,940
how you're going for one of the things

237
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:44,770
you want to do when you're picking an

238
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:47,470
identity is you want to pick an identity

239
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:48,400
that will allow you potentially can show

240
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:50,910
your near better

241
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:53,439
so one of the way to do that would be

242
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:56,860
googling and you can just google for a

243
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:59,790
company find their logo and call up a

244
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:01,779
print job get the discards get shirts

245
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:03,490
just say you're with the company how

246
00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:05,439
many of those places are actually going

247
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:08,110
to call the company and verify you work

248
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,420
there probably not many if they ask just

249
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:11,860
say oh well I'm just emailing you from a

250
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:13,089
personal account because my curtain one

251
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:15,279
got hacked you know how that feels right

252
00:09:13,089 --> 00:09:19,870
most people will pride you but that

253
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:21,400
makes sense so construction workers here

254
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:23,920
you can see they're dirty they are

255
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:26,170
literally knee-deep in concrete they're

256
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,819
obviously going to have tools the tools

257
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:31,209
are all gonna be worn blah blah blah

258
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:33,580
blah and this was an outfit I use and

259
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:36,400
one of my favorites is IT gut because

260
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:39,130
I'm an idea so it's very easy for me and

261
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:42,189
this again when dovo share another

262
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:46,600
laptop Kali Linux USB and general

263
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:48,700
business casual Club now these are

264
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,440
pretty cool if you haven't been around

265
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:54,820
Twitter too much twitter is pretty cool

266
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:57,100
and this left image here is some guy who

267
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:59,920
literally turns his dog into a walking

268
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:01,360
Wi-Fi pineapple I mean clearly talk

269
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,969
about disguising your tools right kay

270
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,260
turning your dog into a walking attack

271
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,029
vector that's pretty cool

272
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:08,740
there was a similar wheel attached to I

273
00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:12,910
forget the exactly well I think it was

274
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:16,029
for Wi-Fi networks yeah yep and if you

275
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:17,560
look on the right there jekhide and

276
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:18,970
tinker have this thing called hacker

277
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,529
adventures on twitter and it's really

278
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:22,360
cool if you don't follow them go check

279
00:10:20,529 --> 00:10:24,130
it out but you know you can see there

280
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,560
she has cameras hidden in the sides her

281
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:28,240
glasses hey do I look truck ready yeah I

282
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:32,020
mean they look a little thick with the

283
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:34,810
style thing you know whatever and then

284
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:37,120
again now we can see here on the left

285
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:39,880
here some guy took a Raspberry Pi

286
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,550
running Kali Linux and shove it into a

287
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:44,439
power adapter so he can take this with

288
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:46,870
them make it look like the power adapter

289
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,520
to his computer use it to hook into

290
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:51,070
another computer or a network or

291
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:52,959
whatever and Vaughn Kelly on the right

292
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:54,250
side if you guys follow mugak he's a

293
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,770
really cool guy couple of people have

294
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:58,480
mentioned today actually and my company

295
00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:00,670
actually does this everyone so why we do

296
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,230
this for like uh like menu boards and

297
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:03,479
signings

298
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:05,730
but stuff like that but really computers

299
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,860
are getting so small now you can stick

300
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:09,330
them in a back of a TV if you can get

301
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,190
physical access and how even anywhere

302
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:13,740
just to the cafeteria the cafeteria is

303
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:16,950
slight publicly open you know literally

304
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:21,620
3-d dongle kali linux plug it into a TV

305
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:25,320
there you go so open source information

306
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:26,760
again the general idea is you want to

307
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,170
look for the corporate information so

308
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,640
you want to look at the culture you want

309
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:31,500
to look at the structure this is where

310
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,699
the ocean comes into play you might want

311
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,920
to look at the corporate blog my one

312
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,910
check out glass or calm but last door

313
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,410
you're going to take a look grain of

314
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:38,760
salt because you know when you go to

315
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:40,620
glass door and you just came away from a

316
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,900
bad company what are you going to write

317
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:45,120
about them not positive things if you

318
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:46,500
feel slighted by your prior company what

319
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,750
are you going to write it up not

320
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,550
positive things so not only 100% true

321
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:53,090
try to correlate it try to build some

322
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:55,979
baselines figure it out that way and

323
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:57,210
then the second part their VIP

324
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,440
information again check out the

325
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,970
corporate Facebook check out the blog

326
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,550
check out their social media profiles

327
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:04,440
the guys might say out going on vacation

328
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:06,209
in two weeks okay cool well between

329
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,400
night and Glassdoor I just figured out

330
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:10,050
that you're a bit impatient so when I go

331
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,870
in there I'm gonna say oh hi I'm Dave

332
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:14,490
the IT guy I'm here to change the you

333
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:16,200
know Jack out in the wall because it's

334
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:18,120
in isn't working well you know how he is

335
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,680
you know how he gets very impatient he's

336
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,660
out of the office it's a good time to do

337
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,979
it you know you don't want to call him

338
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,719
in the middle of his vacation had to

339
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,490
bother him etcetera so he's massaging

340
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,830
these things in and then all of a sudden

341
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:31,980
you build it up and they just kind of go

342
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:34,020
with a little bit and industry forms

343
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,940
subreddits things like that you can just

344
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:39,420
do general information gather and get

345
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:41,640
the jargon so for instance um I did a I

346
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:44,280
did a little experiment where I went out

347
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,810
to an airport and I was a pilot and one

348
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:48,360
of the things or pilots is squawking

349
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:50,310
it's a way of transmitting certain

350
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:53,160
things that are happening so for

351
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:55,170
instance here's a whistle blow squats

352
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:57,270
and if you're going to be a North

353
00:12:55,170 --> 00:13:00,270
American squawk in the bottom there you

354
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:03,380
can see 1,200 is the standard VFR flight

355
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:06,270
clip like pleco so if you're a pilot in

356
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:10,170
anywhere in North America Canada Mexico

357
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:11,550
where then we go to use all the time

358
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:14,219
you're gonna have to know that if you

359
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:16,819
don't know that you're going to be shown

360
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,820
as a fake

361
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:21,220
so cliches and banter and again this is

362
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:24,670
the idea is to drive the conversation

363
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:27,400
away from the things that they might not

364
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:28,479
necessarily trust about you and push it

365
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:32,890
off onto Dale

366
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:35,640
so banner stories excuses misdirection

367
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:40,090
focus these and make them all about

368
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:42,550
let's say oh I got a new employee by

369
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:44,500
scheduler he's not he doesn't he might

370
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:46,000
not work out you know if you if you go

371
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,800
to the place to play oh you're not

372
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,260
actually scheduled to be coming in for

373
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,939
you know repairing the steps today just

374
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:53,800
like oh did he not call you that's the

375
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:55,330
third time this week and then you can

376
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,010
say you know he's a new guy I feel like

377
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:59,140
he's going to work out but he just need

378
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:00,520
to step it up and a lot of people will

379
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,630
just come back with you and try to

380
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:04,329
relate to you and tell you their own

381
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:06,760
story and say oh I know exactly how that

382
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:08,950
is I have this one guy I swear I wish I

383
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,270
could fire but I just can't and they'll

384
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:11,940
just kind of keep going with that and

385
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:15,069
you can just keep rolling with it and

386
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:17,890
move it up from there so different

387
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:20,620
frames to use again corporate policy

388
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:23,080
sometimes corporate policy is just silly

389
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:24,520
and you can say well no that's the

390
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:27,280
policy I don't like it I don't

391
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:30,069
understand it but at the way that social

392
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:31,959
norms being a new parent being the fan

393
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:34,630
of a disappointing sports team right

394
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:36,610
those things can all help explain away

395
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:38,530
the things that might not necessarily be

396
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:41,980
going my way again

397
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:44,260
overbearing boss porco work or just

398
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:46,900
being simply too busy you know I'll I

399
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:48,580
meant to call you but yesterday was just

400
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:51,130
so awful tell them this you know real

401
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:53,410
nice short story about some client you

402
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:55,090
had there was you know really bad view

403
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:59,560
stuff like that build empathy you know

404
00:14:55,090 --> 00:15:01,120
stuff like that so cognitive biases this

405
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,219
is going to be cool because the idea

406
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,690
here is that you want to take these

407
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:07,810
biases and you want to chain them

408
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:08,830
together so the first one there but

409
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:10,959
we're first we're going to talk about

410
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:12,790
actually is anchoring and this is that

411
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,500
people usually tend to rely too heavily

412
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:17,170
on the very first piece of information

413
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:19,270
they get about so your very first piece

414
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:21,490
of amazing information is likely your

415
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:22,900
how you look right I mean that's the

416
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:25,070
assuming the identity portion right

417
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:27,050
that's the picking the tools

418
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:28,670
the making sure your tools are worn

419
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:30,500
that's the making sure your shoes are

420
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:33,469
bent they're dirty they have paint

421
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:35,330
splatters on it's definitely that so you

422
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:37,310
start off there and then from there you

423
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:39,530
say okay well I'm from X company here

424
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:41,599
for y problem at the request of this

425
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:43,430
person and you can use real people from

426
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,870
your open source information right you

427
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:46,819
can say okay well this boss probably to

428
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:49,040
come in I'm from this company I had the

429
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,930
logo on my shirt it's not a real shirt I

430
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,010
print a fake employee badge you don't

431
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:57,560
know what the heck that badge looks like

432
00:15:52,010 --> 00:16:00,260
right right in next one the kind of talk

433
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:02,540
about here is ambiguity and so you want

434
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:03,110
to avoid this one by giving me too much

435
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:06,469
information

436
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:08,720
so ambiguity up there if you look at it

437
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:11,810
says you want to avoid options we're

438
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,690
missing info makes changes unknown so if

439
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:15,979
you don't know much about me you don't

440
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:17,300
really have a good baseline of me and

441
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,700
that was actually one of the things I

442
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:21,979
really liked about the conference so far

443
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:23,900
Dave Kennedy mentioned it yo yo I think

444
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:25,910
mentioned it first vet until 1:00 and it

445
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:28,220
said that you know the basic idea is to

446
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:29,930
take baselines and that's really you

447
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:32,450
know even just general defense in your

448
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:35,689
network find what your networks usually

449
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:39,320
does find the outlier and then that's

450
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:42,020
the ideal find baselines so by giving

451
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:43,910
them just stupid information again just

452
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:46,250
the banter the social norm is just

453
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:48,439
stupid stuff oh my boss is an idiot

454
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:50,990
giving them that little bit of

455
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:53,210
information tends to help them think

456
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:55,190
okay well now I know him now I have a

457
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:56,960
baseline plan right it's not just some

458
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:58,820
random person who I'd says alway he

459
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:01,310
works in this company he sounds like an

460
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:05,079
IT guy he looks like an Ikea he's really

461
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:07,369
going through it and Arthur Aron is a

462
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:09,050
psychologist and he mentioned this study

463
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:10,790
he had where he said that mutual

464
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:13,730
vulnerability Foster's closeness and

465
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:15,680
really what it talks about is it really

466
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:18,500
just a Scott describes the natural

467
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:20,930
process for friendship you know once I

468
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:23,000
open up to you you open up to me and

469
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:25,670
then we kind of snowball that and as it

470
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,610
gets heavier you know a bigger snowball

471
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:29,780
you Eve eventually will have a really

472
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:32,149
think you'll have a really aggressive

473
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:36,139
Who I am right and again that's the

474
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:38,090
baseline so after that you want to chain

475
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,900
this into the authority and the scribes

476
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,240
dead stuff right

477
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:43,490
so if all of a sudden you're showing up

478
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,470
you're talking to them you're you know

479
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:47,830
doing banter and if you've listened to

480
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:50,540
some of the the social engineering CTS

481
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:51,889
banter and small talk is huge I mean

482
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:54,399
that's that's really where they spend

483
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:56,720
probably what 40% of the conversation

484
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:00,640
it's in between parts of the face the

485
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:05,360
fillings it's a void in the ambiguity

486
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:08,059
the next part is the zero risk one and

487
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:11,649
this one is it can be used to get you

488
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:15,678
out of a situation so let's say oh geez

489
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:19,400
wrong time so let's say that you're

490
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:21,559
going in to this place and the very

491
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,360
first thing you get in there you realize

492
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:26,059
that you don't have an ID and the

493
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,879
security guard checks IDs well you can

494
00:18:26,059 --> 00:18:30,379
say hey look yeah I have a young son at

495
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,780
home he wanted to see what I looked like

496
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:34,340
so he was playing with it he lost it I

497
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:36,160
haven't found it yet it just happened

498
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:39,320
this morning here's my employee badge

499
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:41,780
fake her real who knows is that good

500
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:43,970
enough and for a lot of people that

501
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:46,340
might that could get you in pretty

502
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:48,710
easily and again it's that zero risk it

503
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:51,889
actually uses that that bias and it says

504
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:54,140
they prefer small risks over a larger

505
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:55,730
risk of a larger reduction so you want

506
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:57,290
to make it seem there's a problem

507
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:58,610
there's another thing called the hairy

508
00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:00,830
arm technique or talking to the rubber

509
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:03,020
duck where you say you know there was a

510
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:05,059
photographer configured out that when

511
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:06,710
you put a certain frame in a photo of

512
00:19:05,059 --> 00:19:08,899
like a little bit of his hairy arm very

513
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:10,730
picky clients would say hey get rid of

514
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:12,050
that and then it's good there were

515
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:13,640
certain client fee had that always had

516
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:15,169
to find something wrong so by giving

517
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,540
them just a little bit of something at

518
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:18,770
the beginning it automatically focuses

519
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:20,330
on them the one that it's almost like

520
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:22,550
shortly in a sense you know they'll go

521
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:24,439
okay sure that doesn't look right let's

522
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:26,450
investigate that oh okay then you

523
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,400
already had this plan in place to be

524
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:31,220
able to say oh well no look I'm dressed

525
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:34,070
like it oh yeah I don't have my my real

526
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:34,820
legal ID but here's my badge here's my

527
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:36,559
business card

528
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:40,480
go to my website create a fake website

529
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,480
you know stuff like that

530
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:48,100
so just to go over a couple of these

531
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:49,630
these two pictures here I'm in the

532
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,790
computer man if you google computer man

533
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:54,220
you'll find these two videos the left

534
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:56,139
one here is just a small business guy

535
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:58,540
and they're all going through dancing it

536
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:59,860
was really cool and the right one you

537
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,250
can see the cool Tron graphics there

538
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:03,189
right

539
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:05,080
so these Tron graphics this is from some

540
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:07,030
80s children's Canadian show or

541
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:11,070
something the guy doesn't like tight

542
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:14,860
robot moves to check them out what's up

543
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:17,439
that exactly and so again going back to

544
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:20,679
Def Con Chris Silver's from Def Con 24

545
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:23,080
he used this idea where he said okay I'm

546
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,640
going to send someone a gift card for a

547
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,169
very real thing that their company did

548
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,910
he found through up through ocean that

549
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:29,500
they were doing this gift card thing and

550
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:31,870
he said okay I'm going to cinema link

551
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,400
the link isn't going to work and then

552
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:35,679
when the wing link doesn't work I'm

553
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,110
going to offer to remote in and help

554
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:41,080
assist assist that person right and

555
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:43,120
again appealing their interest abusing

556
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,379
self-interest hey you want to gift art

557
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,030
who doesn't want a free gift r3 mine

558
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:47,920
even if you don't want to spend it at

559
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:50,860
that place you can you know hock it for

560
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:59,020
everything you did he's in price made so

561
00:20:50,860 --> 00:21:03,610
you know and then hmm go to the next one

562
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:06,190
so auditors and new employees there was

563
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:08,740
a Def Con 20 CTF and the guy's name was

564
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:10,870
chain and what he did was he pretended

565
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:12,340
to be a government contractor a new

566
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:14,290
government contractor for Walmart and

567
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:16,750
he's working on this big project it was

568
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:18,460
super-secret and he called it a target

569
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:20,740
in front of everyone at Def Con

570
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:23,560
obviously and said you know hey um I'm

571
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:25,240
here I'm gonna you know we're profiling

572
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,730
your store you want to just get some

573
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,780
information about it to see if you'd be

574
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:30,460
possible for you to go in this program

575
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,750
with us and you know you'd be like the

576
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:33,430
flagship store you'd be like a guinea

577
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,800
pig in a sense and gets people excited

578
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:37,240
obviously you know so they're gonna say

579
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,649
you know okay and he ended up going

580
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,080
through and talking to them and just

581
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:42,670
going through the general banter with

582
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,919
them and the end up getting all the

583
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:46,780
flags at once he got their suppliers you

584
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:49,030
got their vendors you got you know the

585
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:50,530
information about their their computer

586
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:52,270
systems yeah all kinds of stupid stuff

587
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:53,990
out of it just from pretending that he

588
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:56,779
was some auditing

589
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:58,100
and again you know you can say you can

590
00:21:56,779 --> 00:22:00,379
do some old sign you can say okay well

591
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:02,059
I'm calling you on behalf of this real

592
00:22:00,379 --> 00:22:05,418
manager from your company who is a very

593
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:09,049
big deal and I'm also from a reputable

594
00:22:05,419 --> 00:22:12,559
auditing company so that way you might

595
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:15,168
not be obviously but if you build that

596
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:17,330
up you can say oh hey no no really I am

597
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:20,179
and that's basically what he did and

598
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:21,649
again tinker the hacker adventures there

599
00:22:20,179 --> 00:22:24,559
was another one where he did an internal

600
00:22:21,649 --> 00:22:26,299
audit and companies will oftentimes have

601
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,559
surprised off especially in the food

602
00:22:26,299 --> 00:22:29,690
industry sometimes health they're not

603
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:32,749
usually surprising helped them whatever

604
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:34,460
so he said you know he showed up out of

605
00:22:32,749 --> 00:22:36,049
the blue randomly just knowing the

606
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:38,690
company name just knowing the boss man

607
00:22:36,049 --> 00:22:39,408
and said okay hi I'm here to do a

608
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:42,230
surprise about it

609
00:22:39,409 --> 00:22:45,789
show me around and managers all right

610
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:49,039
just like that went along with now

611
00:22:45,789 --> 00:22:50,809
vendor reps I don't know why anyone

612
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,610
would want to be one little loan to

613
00:22:50,809 --> 00:22:57,918
pretend to be one but it's definitely

614
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:59,990
some way that you could get in so if you

615
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,820
think about what a vendor rep does they

616
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:03,590
bring free stuff the free stuff always

617
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:05,119
has the complete logo on it so if you're

618
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:07,490
looking for the company logo look up

619
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:08,779
like EPS files vector files things like

620
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:10,399
that and then take them to a local print

621
00:23:08,779 --> 00:23:11,990
shop a buddy or you know whatever how

622
00:23:10,399 --> 00:23:13,340
are you going to do it and print out

623
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:16,070
stuff with that if you're not using

624
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:18,830
buzzwords then you don't sound like a

625
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:21,470
vendor rep no symmetry no synergy no

626
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:24,259
horizontal or vertical integration next

627
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:25,820
gen AI or cloud right I mean you guys

628
00:23:24,259 --> 00:23:26,899
got a third yeah put those in there if

629
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:31,129
you're going to pretending to be a

630
00:23:26,899 --> 00:23:34,340
vendor it and so it looks like we're

631
00:23:31,129 --> 00:23:36,939
just about out of time you question

632
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,939
conference

633
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,860
you
