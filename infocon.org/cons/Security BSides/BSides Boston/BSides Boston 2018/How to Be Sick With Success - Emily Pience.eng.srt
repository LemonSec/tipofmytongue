1
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:08,320
so welcome to being sick with success

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:11,320
advocating for yourself in an apathetic

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,970
world this is just not a thorough but

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,920
it's kind of a down and dirty primer of

5
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:16,630
laws that are applicable to you how to

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,939
keep your job how to be the best patient

7
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,109
that you can be and then also we're

8
00:00:18,939 --> 00:00:22,989
going to open up the discussion a little

9
00:00:20,109 --> 00:00:27,220
bit about why we need transparency about

10
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:28,900
this some of it will be like really you

11
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:33,180
need to actually tell people this I've

12
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:35,858
worked in inch disability insurance for

13
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,510
15 years and yeah you really do need to

14
00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:40,600
tell people some of this so I apologize

15
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:43,089
if it seems redundant or ridiculous so

16
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,940
disclaimers this is me not my employers

17
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:47,769
obviously I'm not your employer your

18
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:50,559
insurance company anything I say is not

19
00:00:47,769 --> 00:00:52,929
a guarantee of anything I am also not a

20
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,968
lawyer specifically I'm not a disability

21
00:00:52,929 --> 00:00:56,320
lawyer so again the information I'm

22
00:00:54,969 --> 00:00:58,269
providing is based on my own personal

23
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,399
experience in my work industry my

24
00:00:58,269 --> 00:01:03,730
knowledge and the best of my abilities

25
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:06,250
as a researcher there's some I might I

26
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:08,110
think it comes up a little bit have some

27
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:10,900
words that sometimes makes people

28
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:15,880
uncomfortable and like I said before it

29
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:19,180
is a high level overview so I'm going to

30
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:21,449
start with a quote disability is not a

31
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:23,770
passive experience it's an active one

32
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:27,040
it's trying to interact with the world

33
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:28,899
that is not easily accept accessible I'm

34
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,580
more often mentally exhausted by the

35
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:33,190
experience of disability that I am

36
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:34,900
physically exhausted as we have the

37
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:37,390
medical technology to better treat

38
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:39,700
chronic illnesses hypertension I have

39
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:41,170
Crohn's disease we live with them so

40
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,610
that we have long-term side effects from

41
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:44,470
their ongoing symptoms to the point

42
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:47,560
where they veer into sometimes a

43
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:52,210
disability and impacts our ability to

44
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:55,150
function on a daily basis and so like I

45
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:57,250
said it veers into disability a lot of

46
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:59,230
people go what I don't have a disability

47
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:01,570
I have hypertension I have diabetes

48
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:04,740
that's not a disability so I guide you

49
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:08,160
to the Americans with Disabilities Act

50
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:11,680
their guide to disability rights laws

51
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,570
which says a person who has a physical

52
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,460
this is how they define disability a

53
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,209
person who has a physical or mental

54
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,640
impairment

55
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:21,100
that substantially limits one or more

56
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,839
major life activities major life

57
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:25,269
activities would be your ability

58
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,400
interact with your surroundings on a

59
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:30,520
daily basis the ability to feed yourself

60
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:32,110
the ability to go to the bathroom the

61
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,730
ability to transfer yourself from

62
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,920
sitting to standing position to get in

63
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:39,850
and out of cars to use stairs and or

64
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:42,730
elevators to communicate caring for

65
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:51,480
yourself seeing speaking being

66
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:51,480
understood breathing excuse me sorry

67
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:58,120
so how does this apply to infosec and I

68
00:02:56,019 --> 00:02:59,530
know it's kind of not cool to put the

69
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,230
whole link but I put the link in there

70
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:04,180
because it says if you work in these NIT

71
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,069
these 10 things are probably killing you

72
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,810
and it doesn't say that on the page when

73
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:12,129
you pull it up so these are the 10

74
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:16,329
things that they give us and these are

75
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:18,760
the four that I feel affect everybody in

76
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:22,840
infosec or most affects people in

77
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:24,849
infosec specifically especially anxiety

78
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,280
stress and depression there was a talk

79
00:03:24,849 --> 00:03:31,179
three years ago at Def Con that

80
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:34,419
specifically discussed infosec and

81
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:36,489
suicide attempts and alcoholism so I

82
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:39,159
think we all know somebody who veers

83
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:41,200
into having enough mental health issues

84
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:43,328
where substance abuse has become a

85
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:47,950
problem for them I mean we've all seen

86
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:50,200
it everywhere 15 million u.s. adults

87
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:53,200
live with major depressive disorder and

88
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:55,719
out of those ninety-seven percent say

89
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,268
that it affects their ability to work

90
00:03:55,719 --> 00:04:00,728
two days out of the week so that gives

91
00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:02,409
you any idea so 15 million of us are

92
00:04:00,729 --> 00:04:07,180
walking around saying I can't function

93
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:09,519
two days a week so having your chronic

94
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:11,349
illnesses is like having a second job

95
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,439
except instead of getting paid you're

96
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:15,698
doing the paying nobody really talks

97
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:17,738
about what happens if you're sick and

98
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:19,269
you don't get better you don't die you

99
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:22,479
get to live in the personal margins

100
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:24,190
because it's either or another really

101
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,039
well and you're never sick and going to

102
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:29,949
die there's no recovery there's no

103
00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:32,440
getting over it and in our culture

104
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:34,449
especially infosec there's no room for

105
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:38,830
in between you're either awesome rock

106
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:40,150
star you suck and get the heck out so

107
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:42,550
it's a pretty little picture that

108
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:44,940
somebody made a meme of so Crohn's is

109
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,940
what I have

110
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:52,389
so how to be a professional sick kid

111
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:54,310
that's why I consider myself that's the

112
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:55,660
title it gave myself I've been sick

113
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:59,230
since I was about eight years old I

114
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:01,540
started having random abdominal pains

115
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:07,240
that turned into diarrhea eight or nine

116
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:09,880
times a day it affected my growth

117
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,740
ability it affected my ability to in q

118
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:14,830
Bertie I with her long process of

119
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:16,419
diagnosis it took them ten years of me

120
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,310
going to doctor after doctor after

121
00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:19,810
doctor saying something's wrong and then

122
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,700
going no you're crazy or go through

123
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:24,400
puberty oh maybe you have Munchausen's

124
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:25,870
oh maybe it's stress oh maybe it's just

125
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,719
irritable bowel syndrome you need to eat

126
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:31,780
more fiber and then finally after I was

127
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,580
17 and wait 89 pounds from being so ill

128
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:36,010
for so long you're like oh maybe you

129
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:38,460
really do have something so I was given

130
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:46,419
a colonoscopy and diagnosed with Crohn's

131
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:48,729
it um so see the next one so people ask

132
00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:52,659
how I define myself and that I use the

133
00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:55,719
the non of I use the definition a

134
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:57,580
professional sick kid they ask do I

135
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,890
consider myself a sufferer or victim of

136
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:01,630
circumstance a survivor or a fighter and

137
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:03,550
I've also been accused of using my

138
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:05,710
experiences to gain attention like when

139
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:06,880
you're open about stuff people like oh

140
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:08,289
you're just doing it because you want to

141
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,880
attention you want people to hear you

142
00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:12,580
you want people to feel sorry for you

143
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:14,229
and I see no being a survivor would

144
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:17,669
indicate that I've survived something I

145
00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:21,340
haven't I deal with it every single day

146
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:23,229
it's not true when I constantly live

147
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,880
with it there's no surviving it again a

148
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:26,710
fighter also means that I'm fighting

149
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,620
something off and one of us is going to

150
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:33,520
win mere Crohn's so I'm not hiding it on

151
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:35,710
a daily basis I have to live with it to

152
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,140
accept one's past ones history is not

153
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:40,989
the same as drowning in it it's learning

154
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:42,669
how to use it an invented pass can never

155
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:45,190
be used because it cracks and crumbles

156
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:47,530
under the pressures of a life like play

157
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:51,340
and a seasonal drought James Baldwin's

158
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:53,169
on my favorite writers ever you can't

159
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:55,570
invent the fact that you don't have

160
00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:58,400
something so the first part of

161
00:06:55,570 --> 00:07:00,259
advocating for yourself is it mittens

162
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,630
self that something is wrong that you're

163
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:04,190
not normal that you have certain

164
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:06,050
limitations that you do need

165
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,520
accommodations for and you need to be

166
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:12,259
strong enough to know that you can use

167
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:14,990
that as a voice so how do we go about

168
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:18,020
doing this first of all you have to know

169
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:20,030
your you have to know your disease

170
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:23,900
or diagnosis know how to spell it

171
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:26,090
correctly a lot of people don't know the

172
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:28,909
basic anatomy and physiology of actually

173
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:31,489
how it affects you and how it works know

174
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:33,560
how to give a summary of yourself in

175
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,760
three minutes or less so like for

176
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,770
instance if I was going to the emergency

177
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:39,590
room today I'd say i'm a 34 year old

178
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:42,169
female i have a 20-plus cute history of

179
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:43,880
Crohn's I've had these surgeries in the

180
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:46,190
past I'm having these symptoms for the

181
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:48,409
past few weeks I saw my doctor last week

182
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:52,430
he wants me to do this I'm here for this

183
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:55,970
reason and also any other conditions

184
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:59,900
that you may have or may affect you so

185
00:07:55,970 --> 00:08:01,520
again who what and what not and the when

186
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,530
the long story so like I had a surgery

187
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,389
10 years ago I had this one to a couple

188
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:07,309
years ago but these are the symptoms and

189
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:08,599
dealing with and then also know your

190
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:10,099
respites your rights and

191
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:12,139
responsibilities and these can be found

192
00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:13,849
I mean doctors office legally has to

193
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:17,720
have them posted as does the emergency

194
00:08:13,849 --> 00:08:19,490
room and hospitals its your right to be

195
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:22,190
listened to you by your hair providers

196
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:24,880
its your right to have access to your

197
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:29,060
full medical history and your medical

198
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:30,740
file it's your responsibility to convey

199
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:32,690
as to the best of your knowledge what's

200
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:35,479
going on and it's also your

201
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:37,640
responsibility to listen to your

202
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:40,159
provider and ask questions until you

203
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:42,860
understand it's their responsibility to

204
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:45,560
continue to answer those questions until

205
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:48,080
they know you understand it's also your

206
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,520
responsibility to tell them if you're

207
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,620
not going to follow a treatment playa

208
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,800
they will take you a lot more seriously

209
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:56,600
so if you say okay you're going to

210
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,120
prescribe you this drug I've been on

211
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,830
that before it affects me this way so

212
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,720
even if you want me to go on it I'm not

213
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:05,150
going to do it like prednisone I've been

214
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:09,030
on and off prednisone for years makes me

215
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:11,340
miserable makes me you know huge hate it

216
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:13,410
makes my partner insane because he has

217
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:14,280
to deal with me so I say to them you

218
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,540
know I know you're going to prescribe

219
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,280
that for me but I'm not going to do it

220
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,270
they'll take you a lot more seriously if

221
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,610
you come back and you're like no I

222
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:21,660
didn't do it they're going to write down

223
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:23,790
non-compliance which means that you

224
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:25,890
don't care there's a difference between

225
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:27,930
knowing what you can and can't do and

226
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:30,090
will and won't put up with versus not

227
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:31,829
caring so communicating that to them is

228
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:34,110
a very important so keeping track of

229
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:36,930
your so you need to have some

230
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:39,300
source that's easily accessible to you

231
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:42,989
possibly in a shareable place google

232
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:45,930
docs Dropbox sharing platforms spider

233
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:48,150
oak is a good one to being somewhat of a

234
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:50,189
Luddite I keep mine in a word doc on my

235
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,750
hard drive and I print it off every

236
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,400
three to six months and keep it in a

237
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:57,090
three-ring binder that I take with me to

238
00:09:53,400 --> 00:10:00,840
the doctor's office and you need to have

239
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:03,810
certain information listed keep doing

240
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:06,030
that I'm sorry the name and number of

241
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:08,040
all your doctors and specialities your

242
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:09,680
current insurance coverage dates of all

243
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,839
major surgeries and procedures

244
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,870
medications relevant symptoms you've had

245
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:18,660
recently timeline of recent incidents of

246
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:20,520
your what's going on a copy of results

247
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,900
of a recent diagnostic tests like again

248
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,280
I said you have a right to that

249
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:27,209
information you're at your doctor's

250
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:29,850
office say hey can you you know 0x me a

251
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:30,960
copy of my latest lab result you may not

252
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,340
understand them but when you go to the

253
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,410
emergency room when something happens

254
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:36,360
you give it to them and they'll

255
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:39,120
understand it and then that saves them a

256
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:41,190
lot of back work of having to do it and

257
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,840
also you can obtain a copy of your

258
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:45,440
explanations of benefits from your

259
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:49,530
insurance provider they're usually saved

260
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:51,420
through patient portals online 18 to 24

261
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:53,819
months back history and then after that

262
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:56,790
you do have a right to request them in

263
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:59,610
writing they're important too so that

264
00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:01,349
you because I with all of that

265
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:03,270
information there's no way you're going

266
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,710
to remember at all so sometimes it's

267
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:06,510
good to have another version of what's

268
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:08,100
going on so yeah I really did have this

269
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:11,370
surgery I really did have a cat scan

270
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:14,700
that sort of thing and it's important to

271
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:16,320
have this accessible because doctors

272
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,390
will take you a lot more seriously if

273
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,089
you know the intimate details of

274
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:21,279
everything

275
00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:22,870
going on they are going to take a lot

276
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,339
more seriously everything else that you

277
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:27,009
have to say about what's going on with

278
00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:29,800
you I found this especially true in

279
00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:33,160
mental behavioral health i also have a

280
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:35,439
depression and when I see those

281
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,120
providers I bring this along as well

282
00:11:35,439 --> 00:11:38,469
these are all the physical aspects of

283
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,410
what's been going on with me and this is

284
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:42,759
how it's affected me mentally and

285
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:44,290
they're a lot more willing to listen

286
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:45,790
because they know i know what i'm

287
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:50,559
talking about as far as myself is

288
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:54,189
concerned keeping track of your so

289
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:56,680
your personal logs there's a lot of apps

290
00:11:54,189 --> 00:11:58,990
out there there's and these are the

291
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,309
icons for them there's my therapy med

292
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:02,589
pill reminder how to keep track of your

293
00:12:00,309 --> 00:12:04,059
dosages and everything my pill box pro

294
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:07,059
which will actually remind you one to

295
00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:09,459
take your dosages I use GI buddy which

296
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:11,860
is a Chrome's tracker pain symptoms

297
00:12:09,459 --> 00:12:15,790
number of bowel movements what they look

298
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:19,389
like all that fun stuff this one is

299
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:21,699
called i forget what levels fault and I

300
00:12:19,389 --> 00:12:23,980
apologize but it's basically a symptom

301
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:25,959
tracker as well that one's called simple

302
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,939
but it's simple with a y in it again is

303
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:29,829
a symptom tracker and a healthcare

304
00:12:27,939 --> 00:12:32,620
tracker so you can combine the two in

305
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:35,979
those and then we always have WebMD

306
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:38,529
which I'm a little hesitant to use the

307
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:41,019
app has an ability to save your symptoms

308
00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:43,420
but then it also always suggests you

309
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:45,370
what's wrong with you which you know

310
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:48,639
usually it tells me a dengue fever and

311
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:54,490
or lupus which we all know it's never

312
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:56,800
lupus right so protecting your your

313
00:12:54,490 --> 00:13:00,759
job and how to keep it we all love our

314
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:02,199
HR reps we want to say that they're

315
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:03,759
automatically against us right there the

316
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:05,109
man they're the ones who commenting us

317
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:07,179
these stupid trainings that we have to

318
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:08,709
sit through and has no relevance for our

319
00:13:07,179 --> 00:13:10,240
actual job and they're the people that

320
00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:11,410
you have to deal with what actually

321
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,499
something goes wrong with your paycheck

322
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:15,879
or something and your employer does have

323
00:13:14,499 --> 00:13:18,189
a business to run that's something you

324
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:19,600
do have to understand and it they

325
00:13:18,189 --> 00:13:21,399
ultimately need to make business

326
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,589
decisions that doesn't mean that they're

327
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:26,319
also not people that they also don't

328
00:13:23,589 --> 00:13:27,850
have they're totally bereft of feeling

329
00:13:26,319 --> 00:13:29,500
or understanding so we do need to

330
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,490
remember the fees are your actual people

331
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,990
even

332
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:36,250
you want to yell their names at them all

333
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:40,750
the time so who do I tell what and when

334
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:43,209
and why again I go back to the Americans

335
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:44,860
with Disabilities Act in the

336
00:13:43,209 --> 00:13:47,199
interviewing process it's illegal for

337
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:49,180
employers to ask invasive health

338
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,310
questions Oh have you ever had a surgery

339
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:53,800
have you ever been absent from a job

340
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:57,449
because you had an illness did you have

341
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:59,890
a baby are you planning on having a baby

342
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:02,770
except in cases of certain government

343
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:04,720
contracts and as far as the armed forces

344
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:06,730
are concerned because they have to know

345
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,620
that they can send you to Iraq

346
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:10,360
Afghanistan wherever and they're not

347
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:12,130
going to need to have a medical

348
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,180
emergency for you because they can't

349
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:17,200
prepare for that that's ridiculous and

350
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:19,390
except as it relates to specific

351
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,300
occupational duties so they are allowed

352
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:23,860
to give you a physical health exam as

353
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:26,140
long as it's applicable to your physical

354
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:29,110
duties so if I work in a warehouse and I

355
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:31,779
have to lift 30 pounds three times an

356
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:34,060
hour for 12 hours a day they illegally

357
00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:38,200
are permitted to make sure that I can do

358
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:41,079
that the Americans with Disabilities Act

359
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,760
also i just kind of a primer applies a

360
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:45,339
private state and local government

361
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:48,490
employers labor unions with 15 or more

362
00:14:45,339 --> 00:14:50,200
employees so a lot of us have employers

363
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:53,140
that we've hit that definition and it

364
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:55,120
prohibits discrimination in all

365
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:57,279
employment practices including hiring

366
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,380
firing advancement training they're not

367
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,180
allowed to prohibit you from advancing

368
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:03,939
in your career because you have a

369
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:05,589
disability unless it affects your

370
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:08,260
ability to perform certain occupational

371
00:15:05,589 --> 00:15:11,980
duties so who do I tell continued after

372
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:13,810
you've been hired you know you you've

373
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:15,790
been hired you've already had this thing

374
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:18,729
or your newly diagnosed after you've

375
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:21,699
worked for somebody again HR they're

376
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:23,920
your go-to people they we often don't

377
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:25,149
care for them but they're the group to

378
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,560
ensure that that you have the

379
00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:27,850
accessibility and accommodations that

380
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,709
you need and that they're legally

381
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:31,209
required to give you they know the ins

382
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:38,859
and outs of what's required they know

383
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:40,479
the laws they you you will have to

384
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:42,550
disclose to them because it does have to

385
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,170
medically certified what is going on

386
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:46,120
there's usually a form there you're

387
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:48,399
doctor has to fill out you know some so

388
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,200
had a back injury seven years ago he had

389
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,120
surgery he needs to be able to get up

390
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,980
and stretch every 20 minutes he needs to

391
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,779
be able to change from sitting to a

392
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:57,459
standing position they have to give the

393
00:15:55,779 --> 00:16:00,670
accommodations that there are expected

394
00:15:57,459 --> 00:16:03,670
as well HR is not permitted to tell your

395
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:05,290
direct manager however they do have to

396
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:06,579
tell them that you need accommodations

397
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:09,069
and what those specific accommodations

398
00:16:06,579 --> 00:16:14,109
are but they are not legally allowed to

399
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:16,839
tell them why however I recommend

400
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:19,570
telling your manager and it can be as

401
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:21,610
simple as I have a health condition this

402
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:23,320
is how it affects me or it can be as

403
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:24,699
detailed as I have Crohn's disease and I

404
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:27,430
have to go to the bathroom 80 times a

405
00:16:24,699 --> 00:16:29,500
day they don't understand what they

406
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:31,479
don't know they're going to think a lot

407
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,130
more of you if they know you're you know

408
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,899
not getting up to like go sit on your

409
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:36,310
cell phone playing on facebook in the

410
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:40,149
bathroom versus you're getting out

411
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:41,888
because you have a medical need I also

412
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:44,079
think it's important to tell certain

413
00:16:41,889 --> 00:16:46,360
co-workers transparency is important

414
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:49,599
especially co-workers that support you

415
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:53,320
or do you support them or your absences

416
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,570
will affect them again they will

417
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:58,110
understand a lot more if they have

418
00:16:55,570 --> 00:17:01,029
knowledge of what's going on and how

419
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:04,030
will this help you how does telling all

420
00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:06,849
these people help you again 88

421
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:10,149
accommodations they're legally your

422
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:14,708
employer's legally has to provide

423
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:17,100
reasonable accommodations so what does

424
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:19,270
that mean it's legally defined as

425
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:22,418
modifications to the practices or

426
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:25,299
procedures of the job unless that would

427
00:17:22,419 --> 00:17:28,030
fundamentally alter the nature of the

428
00:17:25,299 --> 00:17:30,820
business so an example of that would be

429
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:33,220
I'm a retail manager I can't work from

430
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:34,750
home because the nature of the business

431
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:38,110
is I have to be there for customer

432
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:41,799
service reasonable also means cost

433
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:43,870
effective to your employer not all

434
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:46,330
employers can afford three thousand

435
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:48,309
dollars at Stan work shape stations to

436
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:50,320
enable you to do that they can however

437
00:17:48,309 --> 00:17:53,240
afford you the ability to get up twice

438
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,070
an hour to walk around

439
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,809
and some you know examples of this would

440
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:59,300
just be like I said sit stand

441
00:17:56,809 --> 00:18:01,850
workstations changes to your working day

442
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:03,530
the ability to work from home slight

443
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:06,320
hours giving you time off to go to

444
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:09,290
medical appointments you know like for

445
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,570
example if you are undergoing treatment

446
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:13,550
for cancer you say well one of the

447
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:15,439
accommodations I need is four hours off

448
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:17,149
on Thursdays to go for chemotherapy and

449
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:22,330
then I'm going to need two days off to

450
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:25,490
recover from that family medical leave

451
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:28,970
this was an access Creed in 1993 it is a

452
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:31,010
federal law that applies to all public

453
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:34,610
agencies companies with 50 or more

454
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:38,510
employees within a 75-mile radius it

455
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:40,699
applies to all employees employed by the

456
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:42,260
previous definition for you have to be

457
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:45,010
employed at least for 12 months before

458
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:47,620
you're eligible to be up to apply for it

459
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:51,650
you have to also have worked at least at

460
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:55,428
1230 hours 30 50 excuse me it's changed

461
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:57,770
within the past calendar year so and it

462
00:18:55,429 --> 00:18:59,330
protects leave for your own medical

463
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:02,510
condition or two here for a family

464
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:04,939
member who has met a serious medical

465
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:06,350
condition again it has to be certified

466
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:08,179
by a medical professional there is a

467
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:11,959
process for it there are legal forms

468
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:13,820
that do have to be filled out it it

469
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:18,320
provides up to 12 weeks of job security

470
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:20,928
of unpaid leave within a 26 workweek

471
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:24,409
rolling period so I go out with starting

472
00:19:20,929 --> 00:19:26,809
July fifteenth I go out for six weeks I

473
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:28,520
still have six weeks until the July

474
00:19:26,809 --> 00:19:30,678
twelfth up the next year is how that

475
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:33,020
works it doesn't have to be a continuous

476
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:35,690
leave it can be intermittent so I need

477
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:37,840
four hours off every Wednesday to go to

478
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:40,520
physical therapy as an example of that

479
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:43,610
and there are state versions of it I

480
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:46,250
know maryland state of Maine California

481
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:49,669
I'll have additional leaves family

482
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:50,900
medical leaves that provide that go

483
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:52,730
above and beyond this that provide

484
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:56,090
additional ones so in that case both

485
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:59,000
would apply then you have short-term

486
00:19:56,090 --> 00:20:02,809
everybody always this STDs and long-term

487
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,490
disability it's not a required benefit

488
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:05,379
but it's pretty common especially if you

489
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:08,970
work for

490
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:10,960
entity and it's offered usually to

491
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:13,570
full-time employees and sometimes two

492
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,850
part-time it employees each policy at

493
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:17,889
each company varies you have legal right

494
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:19,750
to a copy of your policy from your human

495
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:23,940
resources department and or the company

496
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:26,230
providing the benefit coverage to you so

497
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:27,970
some of the limitations of this are that

498
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:30,100
it may have a waiting period you have to

499
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:32,170
work so many months where you may have

500
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:35,520
to be disease free for so long before

501
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:38,740
you can be have it available to you

502
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:41,680
certain limitations may be limited like

503
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:45,610
i know we we had a policy in nebraska

504
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:47,740
and any injuries that any of the

505
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:49,899
employees sustained in rodeos weren't

506
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:52,780
covered because all the guys were rodeo

507
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:54,550
riders on the weekend so if you film for

508
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:57,639
here whatever on the weekend they

509
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:59,550
weren't going to cover that and like is

510
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:02,410
set exclusions for certain conditions

511
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:04,510
and it provides income replacement up to

512
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:06,250
a certain percentage again that tells

513
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:09,010
you in your policy it's usually

514
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:11,710
somewhere between 50 and 75 percent for

515
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:13,300
a certain number of weeks it's short

516
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:15,760
term is usually somewhere between 13

517
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:20,470
weeks and 26 and long term disability

518
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:22,810
usually picks up after that employee

519
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:25,120
assistance programs again not a

520
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:29,050
requirement a lot of people a lot of

521
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:32,260
companies do provide them so if it's

522
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:33,879
usually a phone number that HR has that

523
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:36,820
they give to you you can call them

524
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:41,470
usually 24 hours a day and ask for

525
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:43,389
assistance with any of those things most

526
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:44,710
of the time they'll triage you you'll

527
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:45,880
talk to somebody for 20 minutes till

528
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:49,060
triage your what kind of help do you

529
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:54,250
need they usually most of them that I've

530
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:56,169
experienced provide up to six counseling

531
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:57,550
visits they'll pay for it if you go to

532
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:59,080
one of theirs which you know usually

533
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:02,770
it's somebody who's covered by your

534
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:04,990
medical insurance they can also assist

535
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:06,790
case management over the phone for your

536
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,200
medical conditions and help you kind of

537
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:09,850
rain in and keep track of everything

538
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,230
that we talked about so if you're not

539
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:14,020
mentally capable of doing that yourself

540
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:15,250
they can assist you in doing that and

541
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:18,510
they can also advise you additional

542
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,510
benefits that you may not be aware of

543
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:24,889
what if I can't work so what if I've

544
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:27,350
gone through all this gone thr they gave

545
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:30,040
me accommodations I keep getting sick or

546
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:31,879
it's not working I can't do it

547
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:34,879
freelancing which we all know so much

548
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:37,300
fun is always an option there's also

549
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:40,270
social security disability benefits

550
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:45,430
there's a list of ones that are

551
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:50,389
considered guaranteed by Social Security

552
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:52,250
Agency and it's a federal benefit it's a

553
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:54,440
really laborious application process

554
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:55,760
that is worth it if you need it if you

555
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,010
are at the point where you can not

556
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:00,560
financially sustain yourself or your

557
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:02,990
children it is worth it to go through

558
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:05,389
the application process you call them or

559
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:07,280
fill out an application online you set

560
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:09,590
up an iphone interview with them you

561
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,629
usually have to go through a medical you

562
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:13,939
have to submit your medical records they

563
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:16,040
review it two-thirds of people

564
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:17,540
statistically are denied the first time

565
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:21,170
around unless you have a presumptive

566
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:24,909
diagnosis of end-stage renal failure and

567
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:27,380
stage cancers complete blindness

568
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:28,640
complete loss of all four limbs those

569
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,930
are once they automatically approve

570
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,100
they're like yep no problem we

571
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:33,890
understand you're not going back to work

572
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:38,179
or working as you were previously able

573
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:40,400
to you can also doing this still earn up

574
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:42,980
to a certain amount or work a certain

575
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,860
number of hours per quarter and that's

576
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:48,080
defined on an individual basis based on

577
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:49,490
how much you freely Slayer earns so once

578
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,679
you apply for this and if you are

579
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:54,260
accepted it doesn't mean you can't ever

580
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:56,630
go back to work you can use it for as

581
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:59,420
long as you need it and then if you get

582
00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:03,350
better or things change or new jobs are

583
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:05,270
created that you can do you can say okay

584
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:07,760
I don't need it anymore or you can have

585
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:10,910
a trial period of work whether they'll

586
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,110
let you do it it also after a certain

587
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:13,940
amount of time enables you to be

588
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:15,979
eligible for Medicaid so again if you're

589
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:17,840
not able it's worth it if you're not

590
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:19,070
able to care for yourself because you're

591
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,600
a chronic illness you cannot live

592
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:25,189
without medical insurance I think we all

593
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:26,959
know that right so it enables us to her

594
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:28,490
i believe is six months of benefits I

595
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,650
mean you do have to be out of work for

596
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:33,370
six months

597
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:36,130
prior to being eligible and if you've

598
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:38,409
applied for a long term disability

599
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:40,810
through your employer they will usually

600
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:43,300
pay for a social security disability

601
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:46,300
lawyer to help you with the appeal at

602
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:48,580
process because it behooves them to get

603
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:50,379
you off their benefit look at the

604
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:52,060
government conveyor so they'll pay for

605
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:54,790
the lawyer so that these things

606
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:57,929
intertwined so it's important to know

607
00:24:54,790 --> 00:25:01,540
which is what and how it helps you

608
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:02,770
finally we come to transparency we've

609
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:06,100
spoken a little bit about that at the

610
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:10,240
BNA I'm going to kind of use like a

611
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:13,540
woolly touchy-feely quote to tell the

612
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,950
truth is an act of love in reference to

613
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:17,470
this I'm talking about an act of love of

614
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:19,750
yourself like I said before you have to

615
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:21,250
admit if you're newly diagnosed if

616
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:23,380
something changed you are not the person

617
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:25,360
you were before you are a new person

618
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:27,130
this is called the new normal you have

619
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,449
to know annex that your life is going to

620
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:31,720
be changed you'll have new experiences

621
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:34,690
and new limitations because of this to

622
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:37,090
withhold asst truth is an act of hate

623
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:41,920
towards yourself in towards others or

624
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:43,449
worse apathy I don't care because we the

625
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:47,860
office of truth is actually apathy it's

626
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:50,130
not hate in an industry where there's a

627
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:55,449
constant sense of competition and fear

628
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:57,130
about being the best you know or enough

629
00:25:55,450 --> 00:26:00,300
you know I'm cool enough and manly

630
00:25:57,130 --> 00:26:03,040
enough I'm like the best hacker

631
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:05,440
interpersonal experiences aren't usually

632
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:08,139
shared we don't usually open up about

633
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,720
them that limits you I think in a great

634
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:12,790
number of ways how can you know how can

635
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:18,580
you learn how can you experience other

636
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:20,110
things if you don't share them and you

637
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:22,120
can create partnerships and friendships

638
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:24,129
that would otherwise not exist there's a

639
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:25,419
lot of online support groups as well so

640
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:27,730
if you don't feel necessary like you

641
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:29,520
want to share with in infosec there are

642
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:34,000
support groups on Facebook for

643
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:36,690
everything that you can imagine um to

644
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:41,460
discuss a little bit about self-love

645
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:43,780
this tweet actually came up this week

646
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:47,170
jason scott said he had a depressive

647
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:50,110

more often

653
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:11,840
so I think that's important

654
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:19,120
resources that are available to you a DA

655
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:20,760
gov is a great resource they have all

656

662
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:37,960
details from IBD portal org and then the

663
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:43,390
mighty calm is actually it's kind of

664
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:45,850
like slate but for chronic illnesses so

665
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:47,980
everything that they post applies to a

666
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:49,480
chronic illness and is everything from

667
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:51,159

675
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,070
the weeds a little bit about things

676
00:28:16,049 --> 00:28:26,620
things not to share I don't know I think

677
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:32,289
that's a personal decision that you have

678
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:34,629
to make um I think in the slide that

679
00:28:32,289 --> 00:28:37,480
you're talking about I was talking about

680
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:40,150
doctors maybe and things you don't have

681
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:43,030
to share like you know if you're there

682
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:44,350
for depression you don't necessarily

683
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:46,240
have to let them know when your last

684
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:47,709
period was but if you're there abdominal

685
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,350
pain that might be necessary information

686
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:52,990
so what is and what isn't relevant as

687
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:56,770
far as interpersonal relationships are

688
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:58,450
concerned I'm personally very open

689
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:59,860
because I want people to know I want

690
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:02,010
there to be awareness I want there to be

691
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:05,289
better understanding between all of us

692
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:06,820
you know we consider self a global

693
00:29:05,289 --> 00:29:08,700
community now and how can we do that if

694
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:12,039
we don't even begin to talk about things

695
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:13,720
but also you know I dated and got

696
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:16,000
married and got divorced and dated again

697
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:18,460
with all of this happening you don't

698
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,370
have to let people in on everything and

699
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:22,900
your first date you don't have to lead

700
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:23,689
with your weaknesses I mean we never do

701
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:27,049
we're always like yeah

702
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:28,610
awesome you want to date me but you know

703
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:29,870
at some point there's an understanding

704
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:32,299
that you're going to be open and honest

705
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:35,029
about things you don't have to

706
00:29:32,299 --> 00:29:37,789
necessarily go into the weeds about you

707
00:29:35,029 --> 00:29:39,830
know like I have diarrhea 47 times a day

708
00:29:37,789 --> 00:29:41,419
but you could just be like I have

709
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:43,279
stomach pain I have to go to the

710
00:29:41,419 --> 00:29:45,830
bathroom there is a sense of urgency i

711
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:47,990
need to go or you know i have a knee

712
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:51,139
injury I can't take stairs I can't walk

713
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:52,309
around you know DC for two days like

714
00:29:51,139 --> 00:30:05,320
that's not something I'm going to be

715
00:29:52,309 --> 00:30:05,320
able to do so sit answer okay yes right

716
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:15,230
right sometimes we're trying to not

717
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:18,259
mention it people know is exactly

718
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:21,169
because I had someone accuse be a porky

719
00:30:18,259 --> 00:30:23,360
yeah and I was working late at night

720
00:30:21,169 --> 00:30:25,129
late at night of course and I was just a

721
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,809
little classier than that normal way

722
00:30:25,129 --> 00:30:30,230
yeah because you're tired and it had

723
00:30:26,809 --> 00:30:32,928
affected you the day so I'm an IV in

724
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:35,000
then it was always that bad you know

725
00:30:32,929 --> 00:30:36,830
what we have how am I going to hide the

726
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,860
room five rochas not like the stairs

727
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:43,340
it's not everything right and I tell you

728
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:45,678
why I'm five years old friend scale but

729
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:47,658
I can't help it right exactly and so I

730
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,700
have become more open as I've gotten

731
00:30:47,659 --> 00:30:51,230
older in you know I you should bring it

732
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:53,480
up at the right time like all right

733
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:55,340
there fibro can go and write down the

734
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:59,090
stairs without potentially being a legal

735
00:30:55,340 --> 00:31:00,678
liability to you right or i but

736
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:02,539
sometimes it doesn't work and i think

737
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:04,700
sometimes you had to be aware of a

738
00:31:02,539 --> 00:31:06,799
co-worker that literally I need to say

739
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:09,409
always yeah of course he doesn't want

740
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:11,299
the way I he says it's annoying okay not

741
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:13,429
because I think that loud because nobody

742
00:31:11,299 --> 00:31:15,259
here but because i don't want pattern

743
00:31:13,429 --> 00:31:16,580
because brightness and he actually

744
00:31:15,259 --> 00:31:20,450
realize it's always going to be people

745
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:23,210
who are aids being very real yes and but

746
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:25,549
you better not to be truthful up front

747
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:27,379
the over again the more I realized

748
00:31:25,549 --> 00:31:29,539
because I think I've accomplished a lot

749
00:31:27,379 --> 00:31:31,668

750
00:31:29,539 --> 00:31:34,639

756

degree and you could also be open to

757
00:31:46,669 --> 00:31:52,470
other people is really like

758
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:54,239
I work for something with HIV and I had

759
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:57,389
to make you say to me because I voices

760
00:31:54,239 --> 00:31:59,879
would be a fire for sipping on I know

761
00:31:57,389 --> 00:32:01,859
it's really long you might as well tell

762
00:31:59,879 --> 00:32:04,559
me otherwise I'm going to have fun right

763
00:32:01,859 --> 00:32:06,809
and I brought up the issues on Yelp with

764
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:10,168
new job you know support groups and he

765
00:32:06,809 --> 00:32:12,570

own support you can say to me okay yeah

768
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:22,049
and I this is the kind of game having a

769
00:32:20,489 --> 00:32:24,960
common frustrated I think sometimes

770
00:32:22,049 --> 00:32:28,309
makes you more even as a manager more

771
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:32,309
real to your voice and more empathetic

772
00:32:28,309 --> 00:32:35,609
to speak to that you know benefiting

773
00:32:32,309 --> 00:32:36,629
finding the benefits of or being proud

774
00:32:35,609 --> 00:32:39,840
of yourself for what you have

775
00:32:36,629 --> 00:32:41,279
accomplished they told me I could never

776
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,678
have children and I probably couldn't

777
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:45,869
hold down a full-time job my life

778
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:48,570
expectancy based on the severity of my

779
00:32:45,869 --> 00:32:51,299
disease disease would be about 40 based

780
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:55,080
on the current medical practices at the

781
00:32:51,299 --> 00:32:57,389
time when I was diagnosed I work full

782
00:32:55,080 --> 00:33:01,739
time I have a kid I have a full-time

783
00:32:57,389 --> 00:33:04,139
partner I had my colon removed in august

784
00:33:01,739 --> 00:33:06,989
of last year and I am still doing all of

785
00:33:04,139 --> 00:33:08,969
those things you know and I compared not

786
00:33:06,989 --> 00:33:11,190
to judge but comparatively I know some

787
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:13,470
people in my groups that I speak to

788
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:14,940
won't leave their house because of that

789
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:17,759
surgery and what they have to deal with

790
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:19,979
the emotional and it has made me more

791
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:23,759
empathetic has made me a more aware

792
00:33:19,979 --> 00:33:25,379
parent it's made me a more you know I as

793
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:26,509
a teenage girl you're always like oh I'm

794
00:33:25,379 --> 00:33:29,178
always dealing with the hardest thing

795
00:33:26,509 --> 00:33:32,549
and you go through that as an adult to

796
00:33:29,179 --> 00:33:35,249
so being aware that you know what their

797
00:33:32,549 --> 00:33:37,109
actions their behavior they're dealing

798
00:33:35,249 --> 00:33:39,269
with their own fat on their own issues

799
00:33:37,109 --> 00:33:42,059
so the awareness that comes of that

800
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:45,539
definitely is a huge deal and then it

801
00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:50,820
comes with age 2 i'm a lot more honest

802
00:33:45,539 --> 00:33:53,549
about specific things about my disease

803
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:56,759
than I ever was before the older that I

804
00:33:53,549 --> 00:33:58,589
get and and like you said you you know

805
00:33:56,759 --> 00:34:00,239
you do have to disclose you can't walk

806
00:33:58,589 --> 00:34:01,139
down the stairs during fire drills you

807
00:34:00,239 --> 00:34:02,670
have to just go that

808
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:04,560
I'm you know you have to be in an area

809
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:06,960
of refuge during that time they need to

810
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,950
know how many employees that they are

811
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,740
supposed to be looking for in those

812
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:14,040
areas so there are certain reasons why

813
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:17,040
you need to share those details in terms

814
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:19,500
of celibacy and kind of visibility one

815
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:21,000
of the things that sort of ended me like

816
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,500
I know it will tend to be more common

817
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,540
with disclosure as they get older yes

818
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:26,520
they also just tend to be more powerful

819
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:30,360
don't you have more years of job

820
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:33,270
experience you have more knowledge cases

821
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:34,890
where you know I've seen people wind up

822
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:39,060
in tough situations where they disclose

823
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:42,060
something and what you can kind of bad

824
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:45,570
yes so no someone has information if

825
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:47,159
they're responding to poorly and we

826
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:49,260
don't have a lot of alternatives fights

827
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:51,419
easier if you're like well you know I

828
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:52,620
have a excellent skill set it to the

829
00:34:51,418 --> 00:34:55,139
command and has so many years of

830
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:58,080
experience right is you don't like me

831
00:34:55,139 --> 00:35:00,859
having these means then hey I can sue

832
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:04,200
you and be I can get another job right

833
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:05,970
don't have that kind of recourse it's

834
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:10,560
harder to say ya know you should totally

835
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:12,689
just as well and I find like I said I'm

836
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:15,240
more comfortable just closing some

837
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:18,420
things than others depending on who the

838
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:21,270
audience is when I was first diagnosed

839
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:22,830
I'm into a really tight-knit all-girls

840
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:25,470
high school so everybody knew what was

841
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:27,230
going on when I went to college I didn't

842
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:30,060
tell anybody anything except for my RA

843
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:32,490
because like you know what was going on

844
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:33,990
and that I also needed accessibility

845
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:35,850
they put my room that's right across

846
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:38,910
from a bathroom so I told them that was

847
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:40,500
a requirement they had to provide but I

848
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:42,000
didn't want to be like oh she's you know

849
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:45,210
the sick girl she can't go with us she's

850
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,650
no fun because she can't do this but

851
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:48,990
then as I got older like they thought

852
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:50,370
about me that way anyway because I

853
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:51,750
couldn't go drinking or whatever and be

854
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:54,799
like you know what these are limitations

855
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:58,920
in my life you either like me or not

856
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:00,480
that's you I have to live my life so

857
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,880
that I can live the best life that I

858
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,080
have and that doesn't you know if you're

859
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,130
going to think less of me because I

860
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:08,069
can't go get drunk with you on the

861
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:09,850
weekend or I need four hours off every

862
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:12,610
three weeks for physical therapy

863
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:13,960
there's a bigger problem there and yes

864
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:17,470
you do have recourse you have legal

865
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:20,620
recourse on a DA jakov there are several

866
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:25,089
pages full of state and federal numbers

867
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:27,609
and how to access a lawyer about that

868
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:31,180
information who to go to there's a

869
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:33,700
there's disability lawyers are actually

870
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:37,690
it's a specialty so there are specific

871
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:46,029
ones that you can did you have any other

872
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:48,840
okay no of course that will help you if

873
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:51,310
you're disabled in Massachusetts that

874
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:53,550
probably won't help you with your friend

875
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:56,640
visiting in Florida pressed and

876
00:36:53,550 --> 00:37:01,690
transitioning I mean that's a different

877
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:05,440
we haven't it's not a problem it's a

878
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:08,230
difference we have not become aware

879
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,430
enough of that yet and i still find so

880
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:10,780
you had said you're bullied at work

881
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:14,049
because i don't like the way you type

882
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:15,640
people think is rude that I you know

883
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:17,050
spend half my day in the bathroom well

884
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:18,850
what they don't see is that I also come

885
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:24,280
in on Saturday for four hours to make up

886
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:26,770
for that time so it's we haven't caught

887
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:28,360
up to it yet we haven't caught up to a

888
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:30,580
lot of the things that we are dealing

889
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:32,110
with unfortunately any rate and laws are

890
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:35,740
different in every state which is why

891
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:37,330
there are as well as change it's

892
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:38,589
important to stay on top of what does

893
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:40,360
and doesn't apply to you and know who

894
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:42,580
your resources are to go for that

895
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:48,310
information so that's part of the ad

896
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:52,720
