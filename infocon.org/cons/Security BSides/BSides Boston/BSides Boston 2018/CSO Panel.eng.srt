1
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:12,200
so this is the CSO panel and a lot of

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:14,300
baggage there we go alright so my name's

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:17,900
Patrick clarity on this speaker chair

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:19,760
and decided to moderate the CSO panel

5
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,049
this was actually somebody else's idea

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,520
on the committee and then we asked them

7
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:29,090
do you still want to do it he said nah

8
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:33,550
so it's okay I'll does oh alright so

9
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:36,080
what we have today it is going to be six

10
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:39,680
csos chief security officers chief

11
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:41,720
information people in charge of security

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,300
of companies and the six that we have

13
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:46,820
here represent tech banking higher

14
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:48,500
education and a non-profit so we have a

15
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:53,120
bunch of questions and healthcare

16
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:55,840
developer and I actually three of those

17
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,739
a partner academic and South province

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,050
all right so that's going to make this

19
00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:01,820
next one even more just any sense the

20
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:03,140
next one to us okay I asked them to

21
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:05,239
answer questions from their own

22
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:07,430
individual perspective and not anything

23
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:09,289
like I would think in other industries

24
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:11,240
they would do things and that's why we

25
00:01:09,289 --> 00:01:13,310
tried to get a little bit of a diverse

26
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,780
bored here so that way each of them

27
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:18,590
could kind of answer the questions from

28
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:20,869
their own industry perspective so what

29
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:22,130
we are going to start with and probably

30
00:01:20,869 --> 00:01:23,539
not in the same order that they're

31
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:26,810
actually sitting up there is going to be

32
00:01:23,539 --> 00:01:28,610
some introductions so we have from

33
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:30,649
akamai technologies and I guess the

34
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,690
wrong will go up there is what I'm

35
00:01:30,649 --> 00:01:36,880

stronger community and helping our

71
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:12,340

function of what's expected of my job

73
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:15,620

118
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:13,200
names hence that India's so nicely

119
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:15,000
recreated for himself and one of things

120
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:18,860
that I was noticing was that we didn't

121
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:23,700
have a whole lot of diversity with them

122
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:26,190
yeah very good to that watering the

123
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,690
targa give the power now I was reading

124
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:30,900
the tents and noticed we did not have a

125
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:33,030
lot of diversity and today josh came up

126
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:35,370
to me and said we would like to add

127
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:37,559
another person here CSO panel do you

128
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:41,070
mind this ll be awesome so from Tufts

129
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:44,390
University we have some yourself I have

130
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:44,390
the diversity in the panel

131
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,539
so pleased to be here I managed that

132
00:05:47,069 --> 00:05:50,160
information security for tufts medical

133
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:52,409
center and the floating Hospital for

134
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,300
Children been there about 10 years but

135
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:55,680
always in the healthcare space so it's

136
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,020
more for Harvard Pilgrim and they open

137
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,569
health plan before that and before that

138
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:03,719
i did a management consulting work out

139
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:06,240
texas dell services and rosboroughs

140
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:09,810
management consulting group so there's a

141
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:12,030
lot of blog verticals in there in terms

142
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:14,400
of clients but really specifically

143
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:19,799
focused in health care and love working

144
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:22,679
in the hospital spaces thank you alright

145
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,539
so basically refers to ask them

146
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,909
questions and hear some of their answer

147
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:29,490
so we can start with some really easy

148
00:06:26,909 --> 00:06:31,080
ones for them how about what's the CSO

149
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,220
do with your typical day look like and

150
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,490
take us through some of the typical

151
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:37,250
things that happen in a CSO say let's

152
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:41,340
see who has a microphone wants to start

153
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:44,039
he's good what ya know oh wow that works

154
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:46,318
everyone working with with cool things

155
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:48,090
would be very security officer high res

156
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:51,000
I never really know what men do day to

157
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:53,068
day I try to apply my days as best I can

158
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:58,440
but they don't always targeted way that

159
00:06:53,069 --> 00:07:01,710
I plan certainly what I had what I do is

160
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,770
evolving as the maturity of our program

161
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:07,020
the university is evolving as

162
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:10,198
universities profile is evolving the

163
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:14,190
challenges continue to increase I do a

164
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:17,490
lot of meetings with Jim caso risk and

165
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:19,680
compliance talking about strategies for

166
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,990
implementation for new things that

167
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:27,900
northeastern want to do like good name

168
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:30,630
brand new CMS systems or LMS strategy

169
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:33,810
seems to be a big part of my job note

170
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:37,139
and probably how the university

171
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:39,690
positions itself for all the things that

172
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:41,909
it wants to do and still protect the

173
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:44,610
infrastructure and protect the data that

174
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:48,120
we have on a daily basis and then it's

175
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:50,250
also an annual base right handle is

176
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:54,870
Darren anuran crisis mode in your

177
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:57,270
incident response so the key point that

178
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:59,370
I heard there to agree with that your

179
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:00,930
day is totally not predictable from a

180
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:03,449
long-term perspective and that's an

181
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:05,639
executive function that's not a security

182
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:07,649
thing right did you the higher you go in

183
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:09,779
an organization the less you're doing

184
00:08:07,649 --> 00:08:11,759
routine things because that's what you

185
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:13,320
have grown the team is to take care of

186
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,899
the things that are somewhat predictable

187
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:18,149
and much of your day is handled

188
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:19,680
escalations right talk about the things

189
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:22,649
that are off tracking how do you get

190
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,349
them back on track karen feeding of your

191
00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:27,479
staff becomes a much larger and larger

192
00:08:25,349 --> 00:08:31,560
portion of your job Larry's over there

193
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:33,240
going man little better but it's

194
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,708
ensuring that people have the challenges

195
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,289
that are one of them is that they're

196
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:38,789
suited for right so they can grow and

197
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:40,529
develop you don't take a junior

198
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:42,240
contributor and say oh look I think

199
00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:43,588
someday you can be a senior architects

200
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,079
let me put that job in front of you

201
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:47,579
today it's how do you ensure this at

202
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:49,290
work is being put in front of them in a

203
00:08:47,579 --> 00:08:51,089
way that's consumable that they can grow

204
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:52,770
that your managers are doing the same

205
00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:55,560
that your directors are doing the same

206
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:58,079
so a lot of it really has to do is sort

207
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,399
of watching this machine and making sure

208
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:01,290
that it's on track within your

209
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:03,980
organization and that it's fitting

210
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:06,120
within the larger organization

211
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,950
you know I think the simplest way to

212
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,650
explain it is frequently herding cats

213
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:12,420
which is a lot of what and you just said

214
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,980
it's not exaggeration I think one of the

215
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:17,599
really fun things about security

216
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:21,200
security teams in essentially places of

217
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,940
rapid growth or high technology places

218
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,370
you have the opportunity to understand

219
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:28,500
the business both from a strategic level

220
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:30,600
and a tactical level in a way that

221
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,370
doesn't exist it they'd almost any other

222
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,830
component of that business and so I

223
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:36,480
think that one of the one of the things

224
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:38,790
that I've always enjoyed the most about

225
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,430
it is that you can really get in and

226
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:43,110
gain and both gained in perspective and

227
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:45,719
get the business back a perspective that

228
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:48,990
they're not used to and I think that

229
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,760
aligns directly with being both a

230
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:52,380
tactical and strategic contributor and

231
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,700
so I don't want an echo I mean obviously

232
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,470
the same things that all these guys said

233
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:58,320
what I think that there is very very fun

234
00:09:55,470 --> 00:10:01,110
perspective if we get to others go don't

235
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,560
I think in addition to that the only

236
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:05,670
thing that I would really add to my role

237
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:08,729
day-to-day as being a constant

238
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:11,219
evangelist and lobbyist for security and

239
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:12,600
why security is important to the various

240
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:14,940
individuals you know working in the

241
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,770
organization so I talked daily with

242
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,600
physicians and understand how they using

243
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:20,550
technology and remind them that security

244
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,040
is a big component of the patient

245
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:24,150
experience and patient trust as it

246
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,089
relates to the help you know the

247
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:29,990
hospital environment but that constant

248
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:32,490
kind of lobbying for the program to

249
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:34,970
mature within the organization I feel is

250
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:37,890
my largest role

251
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:40,800
yeah so did Oh to the previous four

252
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:43,050
panelists very much along with Andy's

253
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,520
sentiment is that it is much beyond

254
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:46,949
knows what I would walk into every day

255
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,300
we are a financial institution so I'd be

256
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,440
lying if I didn't say that a large

257
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:52,170
portion of my time is taken up by

258
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:56,400
auditors we're audited five or six times

259
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:59,219
a year so I am and with Deloitte KPMG

260
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:01,380
the Federal Reserve FDIC whoever might

261
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:04,320
be flavor the week at that point is is a

262
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:05,730
good portion of my time but yeah you

263
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,020
know the day-to-day you come in and

264
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:08,370
you're unknown you got to handle the

265
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:10,949
reports there were changes yesterday

266
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:17,040
what happened what was it very much

267
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:21,000
responsive in nature unfortunately it's

268
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,650
a gag album 25 people so coming from the

269
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,480
background we're a non-profit cnc

270
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:27,480
mountain system budget so there's a lot

271
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,430
of all TT Gorillaz and managing security

272
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,740
projects nonprofit has been rather

273
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:33,209
interesting because the audit quality

274
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,520
standards and things that we enable

275
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:37,290
those people with I do think though that

276
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,329
they've all been on as a sentence

277
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:41,400
success factor actually is personnel

278
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:43,890
management as well as communication and

279
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,689
your team as a CSO you're actually

280
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:47,850
working rather hard to be that

281
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:49,620
communication Virgil a lot between your

282
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:52,890
neighbors and the people making

283
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:54,180
decisions in the business so are not

284
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:56,550
suited for multiple industries at this

285
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:58,469
point a lot of rules down to being a

286
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:02,370
communicator and being able to get

287
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:02,760
employer yup John I'm gonna come right

288
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:07,650
back

289
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:08,880
okay so let's say all right listen

290
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:10,800
number one thing as you struggle with

291
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,770
each day at wish you could get a better

292
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,209
handle on or what's the one takeaway you

293
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:16,350
would like to see each of us leave here

294
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:20,550
today that will make the security

295
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:22,560
environment better we have some tackle

296
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:24,329
in the first one on that one a new

297
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,010
circle with every other nonprofits can

298
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:27,990
anyone guess how the most work really

299
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:30,780
hard for little Knights know by now

300
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:32,190
right so obviously financial constraints

301
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,750
of accomplishing the objectives of the

302
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:36,870
organization is always going to be the

303
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:39,120
systemic nonprofits so that that is

304
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:40,770
absolutely the one things innovating

305
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,960
alternative methods to accomplishing

306
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:45,390
their goals so he mentioned earlier

307
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:48,360
being a tactical strategic you have to

308
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:50,939
be able to have a team that can have the

309
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,560
agility to go through the decision

310
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:54,600
process where you go from being tactical

311
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,810
to strategic a rapid notice is one right

312
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,730
back and then one of the ones eight ways

313
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:02,010
actually probably would be that is too

314
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:04,170
long if you do anything especially

315
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:05,880
nonprofits you have to work a lot of

316
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:06,670
people come to you wanting to help with

317
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,640
the mission

318
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:11,589
ization maximize the potential other

319
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:13,540
people have so this personal management

320
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:15,250
strategies again but also one thing I

321
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:17,439
don't think a lot of people see with

322
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:19,750
nonprofits often it's stakeholder ship

323
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,610
so making every single person to like

324
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:23,800
everything that goes detrimental the

325
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:25,900
success of the organization they

326
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:29,589
absolutely keep or give you anything CT

327
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:34,150
meter mark about from the University

328
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:37,990
perspective take away I mean I it's

329
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:41,170
really getting people to understand that

330
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:45,580
there is much are the solution as they

331
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:47,740
are sometimes are the phone and making

332
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:49,480
evil our information security us of

333
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:51,910
commissioning baked into their daily job

334
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,440
they realize that thing that's one of

335
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:55,360
the things that you push really hard for

336
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,020
when we do our information security

337
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:01,120
awareness training is ok it's not just

338
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:01,880
European to buy job that you should you

339
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,790
think

340
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:06,250
is also excited so really kind of

341
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:11,589
driving those things

342
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:14,800
as a super important I mean worked I

343
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:17,710
dated a struggle for me right now it's

344
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:20,079
its value and resources to continue to

345
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:22,570
grow the program we have one that the

346
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:25,000
university needs of the growth it's

347
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:29,400
tough because your university and we are

348
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:32,290
a non-profit so full of money is small

349
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:35,050
if anybody's from around this area area

350
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:37,510
you know that kind of meteoric rise in

351
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:39,310
northeastern over the last 15 years 15

352
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:41,170
years ago we were right there three

353
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:44,050
hundreds and never in the top 50

354
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:47,500
universities in the country and that has

355
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:50,260
brought some very many challenges not a

356
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:52,360
list of with is the fact that people

357
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:55,120
never do our name which means people in

358
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:58,300
China and money I think you really

359
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,310
surprised that red increase profile and

360
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:04,170
attack vectors or comment is there

361
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:06,969
because we're on NPR or there's a news

362
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:11,020
article in The New York Times it's aight

363
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:14,020
surname and finding the resources not

364
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:15,720
only keep keep universe and safe but

365
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:18,850
also to continue to move forward

366
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,589
strategically position as bad or Caminos

367
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:23,250
challenges that's that's the next

368
00:15:20,589 --> 00:15:26,380
struggle is trying to find most all

369
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:28,140
Sonia you described a couple three

370
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:30,090
different industries I think that you

371
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:31,470
kind of cover in your position do you

372
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:33,360
think there is one thing that you

373
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:34,710
struggle with or is it because you would

374
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,440
worry about so many different things

375
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:39,300
that there are not one thing yes so I

376
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,580
see my organization through the lens of

377
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:44,040
if we look at research you look at the

378
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:47,340
you know nonprofit academia obviously

379
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:50,849
large consumer component with providing

380
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:53,190
health care to the masses and in the mom

381
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:58,820
for-profit component of the organization

382
00:15:53,190 --> 00:16:00,480
so you know I think I have to view the

383
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:03,240
organization there's three different

384
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,130
spaces and I've really leveraged

385
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:08,550
leadership in those spaces and gotten

386
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:10,980
them ramped up within security you know

387
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:13,410
knowledge so that I have some visibility

388
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:14,730
that's spread because even if my team

389
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:16,680
were seven people I still wouldn't be

390
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:18,720
able to look at security through the

391
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,699
lens of what they're with their facing

392
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,010
day to day I think the biggest struggle

393
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:24,810
for me that really is getting on top of

394
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:27,090
the technology that's coming into my

395
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:29,689
organization so if you think about how

396
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:32,340
help you know we're in the middle Boston

397
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:34,740
epicenter of great development from a

398
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:37,770
software perspective a lot of big

399
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:39,210
healthcare companies and small you know

400
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:42,270
incubators developing software

401
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:43,920
applications to use on your phone that

402
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:45,810
will transmit health data to your

403
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,380
physician and all of your friends on

404
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:50,599
facebook if you

405
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:52,819
and and so that's kind of one component

406
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,190
of it there's an influx of telemedicine

407
00:16:52,819 --> 00:16:58,310
based medical devices that are now going

408
00:16:55,190 --> 00:17:00,290
to have random operating systems that

409
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:02,989
are not haven't been a part of the

410
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:06,289
program historically so that's a big

411
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:10,309
challenge for me out of you and from

412
00:17:06,289 --> 00:17:13,309
academia to banking sure how do you see

413
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:15,079
is these questions being I'd opening for

414
00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:17,059
you when you went to the banking sector

415
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:18,168
yeah so it's a obviously I don't need to

416
00:17:17,059 --> 00:17:19,579
tell you it's a world of difference

417
00:17:18,169 --> 00:17:21,699
between talking about the financial

418
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:24,859
sector from the higher end hi red sector

419
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:25,939
pirate is very much in open environment

420
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:28,639
it's you know how can we communicate

421
00:17:25,939 --> 00:17:30,830
freely how can we enable this technology

422
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,330
and then its kind about the earth day by

423
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:33,949
the way you should we add us at some of

424
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:36,080
that or maybe should we add some sort of

425
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:37,190
security to it whereas the financial

426
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,500
sector is very much the other way around

427
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:41,840
so the financial sector is okay is it

428
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,340
secure is it a you know button down do

429
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,809
we have all configuration corner correct

430
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,309
okay maybe we should think about having

431
00:17:44,809 --> 00:17:48,980
a user in and see if they can use a

432
00:17:46,309 --> 00:17:50,658
technology so it's kind of this you know

433
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:53,270
what end of the tunnel you're really

434
00:17:50,659 --> 00:17:55,299
looking at but as far as you related to

435
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:58,129
the question one thing I struggle with

436
00:17:55,299 --> 00:18:00,700
my big shoulder right now he has the

437
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:03,380
Swift network if anyone familiar

438
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:05,179
explains my executives yes we have more

439
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:06,409
than ten dollar routers and we do have

440
00:18:05,179 --> 00:18:10,070
something called the firewall on our

441
00:18:06,409 --> 00:18:12,049
network it's difficult to say yeah I've

442
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:14,990
got it and also said try to explain to

443
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:16,639
them what it is but it goes back to the

444
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:18,380
initial question of you know every day

445
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,000
is different I did not know I was gonna

446
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:22,250
have to come in and answer a bunch of

447
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,130
Swift questions one day and now I find

448
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:27,679
myself doing it but I struggle with that

449
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:29,450
I struggle with user awareness getting

450
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,669
my users to understand and be a part of

451
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:33,200
the culture I find that to be extremely

452
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:36,200
valuable from a security standpoint I

453
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,630
want people to take centuries security

454
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:41,240
as part of something that they are part

455
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:42,919
of and by doing so they are secure in

456
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:46,010
the professional environment and they're

457
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:48,590
secure in their personal environment we

458
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:50,030
work really hard at that and i

459
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:53,780
understand i'm getting you guys from

460
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:56,418
bear song about watching um take away

461
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:58,070
from this i think a you know a bit of a

462
00:18:56,419 --> 00:19:00,380
paradigm shift from the security world I

463
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:03,379
try to be an enabler the most positive

464
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:05,240
sense of that if someone says though we

465
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:07,340
can't do that I want to find out how we

466
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,690
can't do that no that servers isn't

467
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,918
allowed well let's find something that

468
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:11,990
is allowed will find a secure way of

469
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:13,850
doing it lets you know let's not be that

470
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:16,070
that breaking point let's be the

471
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:21,139
enabling point of that that's gonna take

472
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:22,399
away Josh your indigent yeah good you

473
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:24,200
know one thing that I was that just

474
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,960
president here was I'd say my biggest

475
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,850
struggle before I I myself and we the

476
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,890
team is prioritization we're figuring

477
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:32,360
out what I want to get what I want

478
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:34,490
personally what I want the team to get

479
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,740
an a-plus on and will be what's okay to

480
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:38,110
get a C on I mean a lot of times it just

481
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:40,610
feels like you're rolling the dice

482
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:43,520
especially when you're dealing with you

483
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:45,168
know a smaller organization but you know

484
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,908
sometimes it just it feels like you're

485
00:19:45,169 --> 00:19:50,870
guessing it really comes down to

486
00:19:46,909 --> 00:19:52,610
intuition and ultimately instinct and I

487
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:56,299
don't know it commission if you should

488
00:19:52,610 --> 00:20:01,250
have a larger larger organization and

489
00:19:56,299 --> 00:20:03,080
I'd say the takeaway is that I think

490
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,760
that the industry in many respects is

491
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,350
become very pessimistic and I actually

492
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,740
am optimistic i think that they're

493
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:09,439
really

494
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:12,710
problems that we can solve if we get

495
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,960

building your program yeah that's a new

507
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:39,620
tangent for India the left one maybe

508
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:41,540
talk about what Joshua is describing the

509
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:46,100
kinds of people that you look for ya so

510
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:51,010
the struggles but I'm having here it is

511
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:51,010
easy everything a good staff yeah good

512
00:20:55,210 --> 00:21:00,740
time I'm kanya so often that was the

513
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,150
state Larry because we weren't here in

514
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:05,510
the previous talk Larry's that I who

515
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:07,940
broke CBE and failed to find 1300

516
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:10,190
WordPress vulnerabilities wants down 30

517
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:12,230
instead but like we hired Larry and

518
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:15,020
larry was it officially security person

519
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:17,240
right his resume was been assisted men

520
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:20,230
for god I don't even know how many years

521
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:23,360
like since before there were computers

522
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:25,400
right great security researcher yeah we

523
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,899
hire from places and sometimes you make

524
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,690
mistakes when you do that right you

525
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:31,880
don't always find it the best fit and so

526
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:34,100
one of your struggles is how do you take

527
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,940
somebody because everybody has value

528
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:37,250
that they bring into your organization

529
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:39,350
and put them in a position where they'll

530
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:42,170
thrive because when somebody is in

531
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:44,480
thriving more than half the time it's

532
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:46,400
not their fault it's the fault of the

533
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,530
organization of how you supported them

534
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,740
of how you train them or didn't bother

535
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:54,020
to and we've done you know almost every

536
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:55,610
mistake imaginable all I'm sure we'll

537
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:57,560
discover some more next year I have very

538
00:21:55,610 --> 00:22:00,530
defensive managers

539
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:03,050
way to fail and you blew off food but

540
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:05,510
for the second one the one thing I want

541
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:07,909
ever been to take away with is you know

542
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:10,010
in your career at some point probably on

543
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:12,320
a regular basis you or one of your

544
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:14,540
co-workers will engage with the business

545
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,879
in a dynamic in which the security

546
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:19,129
person is holding themselves up as

547
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,290
protecting the business and trying to

548
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:24,350
stop this stupid or evil person from

549
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:27,770
doing a thing cut it out it's not

550
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:31,669
helpful right we have security personnel

551
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:33,560
do not make money for the business our

552
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:36,050
job is not to keep them from taking

553
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:39,080
risks it's to help them make better risk

554
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:41,149
choices and any dynamic in which you say

555
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:44,300
that they're the villain which obviously

556
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:47,090
means you're the hero is exactly the

557
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:49,129
opposite we are sidekicks we're in the

558
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:54,439
industry where the best we get to be is

559
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:58,240
Robin you're not Batman we are not

560
00:22:54,440 --> 00:23:02,030
Superman we're not even Aquaman Wonder

561
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:05,660
Woman like that I'd killed 31 woman I'm

562
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:07,460
Robin I'm running around and maybe I

563
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:11,210
help Batman remember to put on his

564
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:13,730
utility belt that's what our industry is

565
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:15,200
there is there something that Andy said

566
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:17,720
on several years ago that I actually

567
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,850
whenever I stayed out business number oh

568
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:22,100
my god what is what is happening he said

569
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:23,990
something very similar which is known as

570
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:26,600
the villain in a nobody and so whatever

571
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:28,340
i'm going to crush created or or is then

572
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,189
tell it to the same thing to every every

573
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:31,139
professional

574
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:32,670
point is when somebody is coming back

575
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:34,800
and saying something that you think is

576
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:37,080
the most ludicrous thing you've ever

577
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:39,180
heard like you step back and try and

578
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:41,159
make sure you don't try make sure you

579
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:45,780
understand that respect in why they rely

580
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:48,150
y all right I got this next one probably

581
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:50,010
a little bit more for Indian Josh since

582
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:51,600
they actually do have staff here humping

583
00:23:50,010 --> 00:24:02,010
your staff and other people have your

584
00:23:51,600 --> 00:24:05,250
company better serve you it's all right

585
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:06,750
give us one tapas and executives don't

586
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:08,820
want problems brought to the mother

587
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:11,880
staff they want solutions offered ideas

588
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:14,040
suggested it takes problem set it so I

589
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,900
have said that to people and I

590
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:18,030
increasingly feel like that's an untruth

591
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,380
when I want to tell that to post I do

592
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:21,270
want to know what the problems aren't

593
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:23,310
even if you don't have a solution now

594
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:24,600
that doesn't mean that fact you found a

595
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:27,030
problem that you think is crazy

596
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,919
existential doesn't mean I'm going to do

597
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:31,020
anything about it because guess what

598
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:32,520
gotta register some crazy existential

599
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:35,760
problems that I can't do anything about

600
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:38,160
anyway and this might just go on it so

601
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,750
some of it is that level of tolerance to

602
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:42,630
understand that when you find the thing

603
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:44,310
then you're traumatized by that might

604
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:46,770
actually be reasonable within the scope

605
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:48,929
to order within the organization so

606
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:50,340
accept it it's going to go up and it's

607
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:54,150
not going to bounce which is not going

608
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:55,830
to move the organization but also expect

609
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:57,870
that if you bring me a problem without a

610
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:59,490
solution and it's a problem that i think

611
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:01,800
i know what a solution is I'm just going

612
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:03,450
to tell you what's good too like if you

613
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:06,120
walk into hey I got a problem like this

614
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:08,580
and you stop I'm going to say ok go to

615
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:11,610
this this this and this like I'm not a

616
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:13,949
psychiatrist if you want somebody just

617
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:16,290
to be able to talk to for a minute you

618
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:18,210
got to start by saying like hey I'm

619
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:19,830
frustrated about this day I want to tell

620
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:22,110
you about it and I don't want any action

621
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:23,679
from but if you walk in and say I'm

622
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:25,149
having a problem with my data

623
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,560
are my great let me solve it I'm a

624
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:29,350
troubleshooter that's what I do for a

625
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:31,060
living so that that's the one thing that

626
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:32,709
I think and I most of my folks were

627
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:36,580
pretty good about learning that one but

628
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:38,500
that's big piece I would say that I I

629
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:41,320
encourage as much open dialogue as

630
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:43,540
possible and so it's never a if you

631
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:45,220
don't have a solution don't don't come

632
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:47,500
what I don't like they don't like people

633
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:49,330
to complain a ton and never try and

634
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,560
offer you know a valuable approach to

635
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:52,060
the things that are bothering them it's

636
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,290
just constant complaining i think that's

637
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:56,409
different than coming with a real

638
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:58,360
problem and and working through it as a

639
00:25:56,410 --> 00:26:00,520
team but what I what I don't like I

640
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:02,649
don't like when people in the security

641
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:05,230
industry in general go to business

642
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:06,520
without a solution right you think we

643
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:08,440
can't just be people and point out

644
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,580
problems right so the most important

645
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,200
thing is that when we see a problem

646
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:13,000
there's something that we're

647
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,220
uncomfortable with that we're not just

648
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,770
going in saying no it's hey how about

649
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:19,300
this or if you can't do it this way

650
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:21,190
maybe we can help you do it that way if

651
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:23,230
you don't have the resources to which

652
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:26,260
isn't always practical with all security

653
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:27,910
organizations a you know froggy staffing

654
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:29,290
reasons but it's a really important

655
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:30,640
focus oh you just not the team of no I

656
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:33,520
know you guys have started to hear that

657
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:36,070
but if that's if that's what your team

658
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:38,710
is doing your time to be successful as a

659
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:40,810
team Sonia I think you said you had

660
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:42,400
seven people and even if you had more

661
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:45,460
that wouldn't be enough oh no I don't

662
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:48,760
have seven people oh man that I said

663
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:51,720
even if I had seven people it one thing

664
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,720
I guess

665
00:26:54,159 --> 00:27:01,340
okay one thing that I guess I DISA tag

666
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:03,559
off of that you know it's I think we get

667
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:05,539
tagged as a team of know and so one of

668
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:06,889
the things I implore people to do is

669
00:27:05,539 --> 00:27:09,859
invite me to the meeting because I'd

670
00:27:06,889 --> 00:27:11,269
rather see that wreck ahead right or if

671
00:27:09,859 --> 00:27:13,070
a new technologies coming down the pipe

672
00:27:11,269 --> 00:27:14,570
or they are planning on you know doing

673
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:16,629
something strategic that involves an

674
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:18,889
application that is fraught with

675
00:27:16,629 --> 00:27:20,600
security holes like Swiss cheese in the

676
00:27:18,889 --> 00:27:23,719
code I want to know about it and make

677
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:26,988
other you know mitigating decisions on

678
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:31,940
it John how does this work with your

679
00:27:26,989 --> 00:27:34,009
office oh man every one of my scenes is

680
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:36,799
you are a security on profit internally

681
00:27:34,009 --> 00:27:38,479
is probably better than I am to be

682
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,220
honest with you I'm the guy that's the

683
00:27:38,479 --> 00:27:43,070
extrovert the ncj is they fall in the

684
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:44,960
psychology world apparently but I know

685
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:46,668
that after that and just trust very much

686
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,070
everything that they do for me the

687
00:27:46,669 --> 00:27:51,320
better served me they can stop bringing

688
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:53,509
solutions for our clients basically

689
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:56,149
because they don't sound like it's just

690
00:27:53,509 --> 00:27:58,009
hey we did this business and nine times

691
00:27:56,149 --> 00:28:01,908
out of ten as a matter of okay with what

692
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:03,409
resource in time but no it's really

693
00:28:01,909 --> 00:28:04,609
honestly about communication and they

694
00:28:03,409 --> 00:28:07,970
never talked about it be very

695
00:28:04,609 --> 00:28:09,439
transparent routine on at times I would

696
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:11,869
like to be more involved as she said

697
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,429
with things that may seem mind you to

698
00:28:11,869 --> 00:28:15,279
someone or they may seem so they don't

699
00:28:13,429 --> 00:28:17,419
have a solution to that problem

700
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,859
cross-pollinating across little work you

701
00:28:17,419 --> 00:28:21,710
actually did a lot of things like the

702
00:28:18,859 --> 00:28:22,908
CFO make know something I've got CEOs or

703
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:26,389
in preventable star

704
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:29,659
I mean that person hell that you see SEO

705
00:28:26,389 --> 00:28:31,149
in one ear CEO other than okay good

706
00:28:29,659 --> 00:28:33,889
that's all so many more of those right

707
00:28:31,149 --> 00:28:35,779
so actually asking something back on the

708
00:28:33,889 --> 00:28:38,029
top side you can also help out I think

709
00:28:35,779 --> 00:28:43,039
not just people that serve you see the

710
00:28:38,029 --> 00:28:46,190
people you work for long okay remark

711
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:52,249
doing a tease me a good yeah I have to

712
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:57,109
say I trust your team for a reason said

713
00:28:52,249 --> 00:28:58,940
smart I knew but what do you make sure

714
00:28:57,109 --> 00:29:02,658
that they understand that it's okay to

715
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:04,999
get a problem sometimes penalize them

716
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:10,609
for that look at an opportunity to get

717
00:29:04,999 --> 00:29:14,599
it right and x yeah in the tomorrow in

718
00:29:10,609 --> 00:29:16,879
Sonja's and Johnson also i really

719
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:19,220
appreciate open communication so you

720
00:29:16,879 --> 00:29:20,809
know it's going to upset me more you

721
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,859
know they come to me on a friday and say

722
00:29:20,809 --> 00:29:24,200
hey with banging our heads against the

723
00:29:21,859 --> 00:29:25,728
wall since monday on this and we've made

724
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:29,269
no progress and we're still dealing with

725
00:29:25,729 --> 00:29:31,309
it i wish it came here earlier you know

726
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:34,279
we've gone to these points and we're

727
00:29:31,309 --> 00:29:38,418
being paid to be solution providers i

728
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:41,629
think at this level in our job so open

729
00:29:38,419 --> 00:29:43,059
dialogue is extremely helpful talking

730
00:29:41,629 --> 00:29:46,580
through it whatever the case may be but

731
00:29:43,059 --> 00:29:47,840
bring us a little every right here party

732
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:49,249
this next one we're going to ask you to

733
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,749
look into your crystal balls and

734
00:29:49,249 --> 00:29:52,879
hopefully with the different industries

735
00:29:50,749 --> 00:29:54,499
we get different answers what do you see

736
00:29:52,879 --> 00:29:56,090
is the next big thing that security

737
00:29:54,499 --> 00:29:59,809
practitioners who have to face and deal

738
00:29:56,090 --> 00:30:00,889
with over the next few years who wants

739
00:29:59,809 --> 00:30:05,510
to jump in on

740
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:07,610
first I was open security vendor I want

741
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:11,090
to say ironically that I think that

742
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:12,949
would you like we fear like a huge

743
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:15,679
monolithic more than security vendor

744
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:18,140
early very important but you do a lot

745
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:21,230
other really cool things I would say

746
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:22,820
that the fact security tech cooling is

747
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:24,770
failing us I mean lately if you were a

748
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:26,450
security practitioner and all you do is

749
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:27,950
install security tools you're not a

750
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:30,380
security practitioners their tools

751
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:32,270
practitioner security practitioners are

752
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:35,000
innovative their intuitive they've

753
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:36,980
learned how to automate problems and

754
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,450
solutions they don't sit there and click

755
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:40,700
the same button every day over and over

756
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:41,750
because they go hey that's not effective

757
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,820
like that's something I should be able

758
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:45,500
to make happen automatically and so I

759
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:47,750
think what if I had first of all its

760
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:49,730
what what a practitioner is and how we

761
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:52,460
start addressing problems to be much

762
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:54,470
more oriented around as much more word

763
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:56,480
interest interest is building it into

764
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:59,990
solutions that kind of bindings in both

765
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:02,930
indoor environment first of all got a

766
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:08,450
protest on security vendor 250 million

767
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:11,809
in revenue broken out our revenue for

768
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:15,210
anything is for security so excited

769
00:31:11,809 --> 00:31:18,540
been waiting to drop exclusive security

770
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:20,940
vendor that's much better secret of

771
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:23,700
boxes I think that it's the there's an

772
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:25,110
approach on complexity apocalypse and

773
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:27,780
you learning what everybody my father

774
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:29,540
and here's a simple anecdote for you how

775
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:32,100
many people here automotive engineers

776
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:34,500
great no hands went up so I've got no

777
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:36,689
readers in the room people remember the

778
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:38,100
story the Ford Pinto put a gas tank

779
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:39,870
right at the very back when you got

780
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:42,990
rear-ended at least yeah how many of you

781
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:45,270
think that's a good idea again none of

782
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:47,880
you you're all lame people and you can

783
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:50,549
all understand how the Ford Pinto is

784
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:52,860
badly designed the jeep cherokee that

785
00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:54,840
was taken over at top speed by a number

786
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:56,729
of your researchers were always supposed

787
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:58,709
to credit and i don't want to like blank

788
00:31:56,730 --> 00:32:02,910
on new haberdasher Charlie Miller's name

789
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:05,160
so it's do I love their twitter name now

790
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:07,169
what did they do wrong anybody here know

791
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:11,640
what is the simple design failure of a

792
00:32:07,169 --> 00:32:14,370
Jeep Cherokee there's like 18 things

793
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:16,020
that go wrong right it's not once I go

794
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:17,939
into one simple we can the aunt about

795
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:20,668
but the lane versity can look at that

796
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:23,220
and say here is the one bad design

797
00:32:20,669 --> 00:32:26,490
failure that went into that systems are

798
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:29,400
now so inherently complex then we can no

799
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:32,400
longer look at them and go this is safe

800
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:34,740
or this is not safe and that means doing

801
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:36,299
risk evaluations really hard because

802
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:38,700
here's the other dirty little secret our

803
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:40,590
industry quantitative risk assessment

804
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:42,809
doesn't work outside of the actuarial

805
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:44,850
industries like if you're doing fraud or

806
00:32:42,809 --> 00:32:46,918
insurance on large populations great

807
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:49,110
other than that all risk management is

808
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:51,750
done from the gut we're papering it over

809
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:53,549
with the beautiful reports that say what

810
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:55,020
we should do but it isn't it's a gut

811
00:32:53,549 --> 00:32:57,360
check we think we need more security

812
00:32:55,020 --> 00:33:00,570
short go to risk assessment so I track

813
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:02,428
which things i'll go do but it's only

814
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:04,350
started because somebody believed that

815
00:33:02,429 --> 00:33:06,840
there was a problem we're losing the

816
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:08,449
ability for lay people and by laypeople

817
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:10,939
that includes three

818
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:12,320
Gio's in the room and all of us if

819
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:14,480
you're not a systems architect you're

820
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,490
looking at some complex system that

821
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:19,100
you're building and trying to judge its

822
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:21,830
risk and we no longer have the tools to

823
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:23,090
understand how these systems operate and

824
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:25,639
that's something that really worries me

825
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:28,189
is will security increasingly become a

826
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:30,560
cargo cult where we just tell people

827
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:31,550
will go rotate your password every 90

828
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,040
days because that's what we've always

829
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:38,120
done even while that's no longer

830
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:42,950
interesting problem or solution sorry so

831
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:45,350
far yep oh so I think we're going to

832
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:48,140
continue to see that cyber application

833
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:51,080
of traditional crying models I think

834
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:53,720
that's the big emotional ladder 15 years

835
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:56,389
you know you had vandalism with people

836
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:58,670
just defacing websites and then we had

837
00:33:56,390 --> 00:34:01,730
that the sole credit cards and their

838
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:04,520
data and there we have you know

839
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:06,710
kidnapping and ransom warrior which is

840
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:08,150
the next thing and even its evolving

841
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:10,280
because they start their your

842
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:12,380
fingers off and send them back to you is

843
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:15,770
it delete your files when you don't pay

844
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:16,250
I think that's it's not gonna where they

845
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:18,379
at

846
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:20,210
I think everybody knows the FBI said

847
00:34:18,379 --> 00:34:23,290
that ransomware is going to be a

848
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:26,840
billion-dollar business this year and

849
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:28,850
it's just never-ending and I think

850
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:31,129
adding to the complexity of the Internet

851
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:33,139
of Things that's just going to open more

852
00:34:31,129 --> 00:34:35,179
opportunities for these you know

853
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:39,320
traditional crying models to move into

854
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:40,490
the cyberspace and and we all have bank

855
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,480
accounts so this should be interesting

856
00:34:40,489 --> 00:34:44,750
to see what you're worried about

857
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:47,120
management I like marc bullard and cyber

858
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:51,399
advised the cyber cyber minus I thought

859
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:51,399
of a good summer vacations like this one

860
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:57,530
too like the bank at pointa know i wish

861
00:34:54,980 --> 00:35:00,410
i had a nice metaphor that like Andy had

862
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:02,660
but um I'm with mark on kind of that

863
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:04,490
that what we've seen in the past or

864
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:06,980
regular crime taking on that digital

865
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:08,240
life and I think one of the you know

866
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,530
again if I knew what was gonna be the

867
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,970
next big thing I'd be talking to my

868
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:13,070
broker's right now and not talking

869
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:15,770
anyone else here but I don't know what

870
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:17,990
it is so I think kind of that I OT that

871
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:19,430
mark kind of led onto is as we start

872
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:21,979
putting on more and more things to the

873
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:23,960
internet without truly understanding the

874
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:27,470
proper ramifications of you know how to

875
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:29,330
secure you know a simple bus within you

876
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:31,790
know jeep cherokee like that you know so

877
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:32,750
someone can't tap into your car and turn

878
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:35,810
it off while you're driving on the

879
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:37,670
highway we're missing that full

880
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:39,110
understanding of the implications of

881
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:41,150
when we add these things and I'm sure

882
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:42,530
Sony can talk more about from a health

883
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:44,030
care standpoint of you know having a

884
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:46,400
heart rate monitor things like that to

885
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:47,720
the Internet the personal devices all

886
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,390
the wearables all that stuff are

887
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:53,480
becoming more and more relevant and I'm

888
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:54,960
just cautious that no one is watching

889
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:58,240
the watchtower

890
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:00,730
yeah this morning when Mudge was talking

891
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:04,180
about how one of the car companies send

892
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:07,330
out a USB to create their own where do

893
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:08,770
so I'm I'm really glad that that I'm

894
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:10,660
hoping the health care industry doesn't

895
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:17,230
do that for pacemakers or something like

896
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:19,960
that Jam this into your nipples likely

897
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:21,670
taking all of y'all laughter yeah the

898
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:23,740
market what would you have them do

899
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:25,990
instead like think through the

900
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:27,819
alternative of how else would i think it

901
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:30,310
was our update we can send it over to

902
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:32,110
the internet and you can download it to

903
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:34,810
your pacemaker does that no damn in I've

904
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:37,570
idea like we have somebody hand side of

905
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:39,700
it all that really makes me scared like

906
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:41,770
so we don't give them place solutions to

907
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:45,819
really children it's going every day

908
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:48,040
when I was on drug dealer but there's

909
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:49,960
real Duke solutions it was easy for us

910
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:53,230
especially make fun of the ones they

911
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:56,410
choose but at the end of the day the

912
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:58,270
larger IT industry has failed yes to

913
00:36:56,410 --> 00:37:00,879
create means that will work for

914
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:02,590
businesses so businesses ignore us

915
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:05,830
because we haven't helped them solve

916
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:07,510
their problems yes are to actually

917
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:09,310
answer your question path from a

918
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:13,930
financial sector what we're seeing is is

919
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:15,700
the sagra fication of money so the big

920
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:18,399
boys editing of that manner in the

921
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:21,700
blockchain looking at kind of how are we

922
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:23,740
going to handle the credit default

923
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:25,600
default swaps and things like that from

924
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:28,419
a financial standpoint with this digital

925
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:30,549
currency it's really unprecedented I

926
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:33,250
haven't seen much regulation revolves

927
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:34,950
around it it's gonna be an interesting

928
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:40,950
world as it becomes

929
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:44,129
morrell into the layperson health care

930
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:46,700
so within healthcare the compliance the

931
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:49,980
regulatory space is changing rapidly and

932
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:51,990
it's been very difficult to understand

933
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:54,420
and the standards and controls that are

934
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:55,890
going to be used across the industry so

935
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:58,320
everybody's sort of using their best

936
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:59,940
effort right now but the technologies

937
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:04,650
that we know around you know encryptions

938
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:06,570
in more secure protocols but since

939
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:08,880
there's really not a definitive guide

940
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:10,710
line and now you know changing with a

941
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,990
political landscape that kind of in

942
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:14,490
government is trying to you know

943
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:16,290
regulate the standard that's even a

944
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:18,569
little bit scarier and more challenging

945
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:19,800
because we do have potentially solutions

946
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:21,480
in the private sector they're going to

947
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,920
be overlooked because government

948
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,900
political officials feel like their

949
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:28,020
standard is going to be better may not

950
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:32,260
may be may not be but it's an effective

951
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:34,810
rapidly evolving the space challenging

952
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:36,730
and earlier one of you referred to us is

953
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:39,340
how many the group of know which is

954
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:41,920
often said that the security team is no

955
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:43,630
you can't do that but enough negativity

956
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,640
in worrying what are some of the things

957
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:50,850
that you think the security field does

958
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:50,850
really well I'll go John yeah sure

959
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:59,050
actually one of the last one answered

960
00:38:54,760 --> 00:39:02,260
Polly a directive if you really come on

961
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:03,880
oh ok my selfish alert moment on the

962
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:07,570
last thing of his challenge to my

963
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:09,700
subjective opinion is that we are not as

964
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:10,930
practitioners in our community mentoring

965
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:13,569
and controlling and guiding

966
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:15,069
industrialization of our workforce we

967
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:17,860
have people with security buzz that have

968
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:20,230
I made an industry experience working in

969
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:21,970
drugs on those people and these children

970
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:23,740
these projects innovations in their

971
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:25,299
pocket of every of the block we don't

972
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:26,950
have the best mentors for ethel

973
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:29,890
barrymore references or them to meet the

974
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:31,180
demand our policymakers i created in the

975
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:33,790
cyber nashville challenge over the

976
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:35,290
summer I was probably not a person there

977
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:37,090
that ever actually worked on the video

978
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:38,800
network which is really good to see how

979
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:40,780
these kids and remember universities

980
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:43,360
talking about policy I actually went

981
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:44,950
there as a social project the CBD to do

982
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,750
a white paper is coming out soon to talk

983
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:49,000
about the socialization of cyber

984
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:50,740
security and to see the difference in

985
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,300
the definition of what some of my age

986
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:54,640
that's working on PhD a political

987
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:57,820
science has to meet us in kc i'm working

988
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:59,379
on is so in 10 years it's good for me to

989
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:01,060
sit down and actually see what their

990
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:03,910
thing is coming and it's totally

991
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:06,730
different so I talked about policymaker

992
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:10,240
definition if people like much DTI

993
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:12,220
workings advocates for years and no

994
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,270
one's could see to have much more

995
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:14,799
drastic impact

996
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:17,110
if they had listened to them whether you

997
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,120
do now so investing into your cheer one

998
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:21,130
person now is absolutely been opposed to

999
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:22,630
your success in the future I'm sorry

1000
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:24,820
about that that's just what I'm saying

1001
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:27,730
any part b 1 vectors welcome back on

1002
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:29,410
that social but negativity and wearing

1003
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:30,850
yeah absolutely or anything optimistic

1004
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:32,410
and it's like the is starting on

1005
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:33,880
the guys it's like it's cool we got this

1006
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:37,440
don't worry about it sometime i three

1007
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:37,440
gigs of data would be probably that back

1008
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:41,650
it was good though is that your bank

1009
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:43,900
card works you'll right I don't know

1010
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:45,940
it's all century um they probably just

1011
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:49,930
be want to know telling me how's it

1012
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:51,850
going um Gator but know some of these

1013
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:53,410
materials / well so we're actually going

1014
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:55,480
to go back into their coin there I've

1015
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:58,420
seen the hackerspace situation right

1016
00:40:55,480 --> 00:41:00,580
people while it sounds to people that

1017
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:02,530
arguing better things on their off-duty

1018
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:04,630
time than they're not if I working as a

1019
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:06,460
security practitioner and we've only

1020
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:08,680
driving that later but I really think is

1021
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:10,480
what we're doing well we are working as

1022
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:12,759
a middle piece better now I think that

1023
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,920
we honestly ever have an industry yet

1024
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:16,120
cso's that are going out of their lanes

1025
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:18,130
and doing things like going to the

1026
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:19,420
Masters developing with the CEO because

1027
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:21,280
they know that might be what it needs to

1028
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:23,830
take it are keen to victory you next

1029
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,870
year and its back in the day that would

1030
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:28,120
then never even heard the security guy

1031
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:30,609
and I didn't even have an you know a

1032
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:32,109
full seat of the board so I think we're

1033
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:34,000
doing really well today or bringing

1034
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:38,640
ourselves out of her comfort zone that's

1035
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:41,989
it all Andy what are we doing well I

1036
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:46,288
don't know dorm conferences

1037
00:41:41,989 --> 00:41:49,199
yeah so it's a hard one yep sort of step

1038
00:41:46,289 --> 00:41:51,659
back and say what is our job right

1039
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:54,539
fundamentally our job is to enable

1040
00:41:51,659 --> 00:41:57,329
better risk voices and so are we doing

1041
00:41:54,539 --> 00:41:59,609
that or is our the industries that were

1042
00:41:57,329 --> 00:42:01,469
protecting thriving and are we helping

1043
00:41:59,609 --> 00:42:03,209
contribute to that the automatics it

1044
00:42:01,469 --> 00:42:05,399
like naming vulnerabilities might

1045
00:42:03,209 --> 00:42:08,999
actually be the thing we did most well

1046
00:42:05,399 --> 00:42:10,558
over the last three and look I know a

1047
00:42:08,999 --> 00:42:12,269
lot of people are opposed it right they

1048
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:14,459
talked about you the jeep cherokee being

1049
00:42:12,269 --> 00:42:16,799
stunt hacking and why do we have have a

1050
00:42:14,459 --> 00:42:18,928
logo for heartbleed and image tragic and

1051
00:42:16,799 --> 00:42:20,969
all this other stuff but let's put it

1052
00:42:18,929 --> 00:42:24,929
this way how many people besides Larry

1053
00:42:20,969 --> 00:42:27,149
can name Seabees by number right and

1054
00:42:24,929 --> 00:42:32,669
sure times on the e guy and I can't

1055
00:42:27,149 --> 00:42:34,499
there we go right we can you know

1056
00:42:32,669 --> 00:42:36,239
continue to think of our industries

1057
00:42:34,499 --> 00:42:37,890
being this arcane thing we have to be

1058
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:39,719
part of and which means we have to

1059
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:41,699
market ourselves and I think we are

1060
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:43,769
doing better marketing ourselves and

1061
00:42:41,699 --> 00:42:45,269
everybody interested that they had to do

1062
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:47,819
something because of Hartley like

1063
00:42:45,269 --> 00:42:50,069
everybody across every business rather

1064
00:42:47,819 --> 00:42:51,689
than I talked with somebody the reason

1065
00:42:50,069 --> 00:42:53,849
we're hiring and he came in he said yeah

1066
00:42:51,689 --> 00:42:56,219
you know heartbleed was a boon for me in

1067
00:42:53,849 --> 00:42:57,689
my previous job I'm like why said well

1068
00:42:56,219 --> 00:42:59,729
because for the first time I could say

1069
00:42:57,689 --> 00:43:03,089
we have to do this thing and pass

1070
00:42:59,729 --> 00:43:05,519
servers and nobody argued with all right

1071
00:43:03,089 --> 00:43:07,619
that's fantastic then we're actually

1072
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:09,178
able to communicate up to the layperson

1073
00:43:07,619 --> 00:43:11,479
even as our systems are getting

1074
00:43:09,179 --> 00:43:11,479
complicated

1075
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:21,089
yeah oh I agree I don't want to go too

1076
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:23,100
much on the same similar rent but the

1077
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:24,690
socializing of security you know the

1078
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,759
longest time the security guy was

1079
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:29,430
someone in a dark room in dark corner

1080
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:31,260
doing you know whatever security people

1081
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:35,339
did you know even if they had a security

1082
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:37,410
guy or girl and I think the ability to

1083
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:39,540
now you know understand that there is a

1084
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:41,640
human aspect to it and being out there

1085
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:44,070
and talking to people and I work very

1086
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:46,140
hard to be the social face of security I

1087
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:48,060
walk around I put my ear to the ground i

1088
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:49,350
know people see me kind of water in the

1089
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:51,570
halls and that's how i get good

1090
00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:52,680
information i learn about it you know

1091
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:56,610
what are you working out when you see

1092
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:59,299
how this where possible we don't just

1093
00:43:56,610 --> 00:44:02,130
becomes very well yeah right thank you

1094
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:04,260
but I'm serious becoming that social

1095
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:06,510
aspect and I think we're doing a better

1096
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:09,510
job of it I think that we have a face we

1097
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:11,100
have a name you know security besides I

1098
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:13,890
don't know how long you guys been doing

1099
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:15,390
this six or seven years six or seven

1100
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:16,890
years but I think we're making that

1101
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:19,980
progress you know six or seven years ago

1102
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:23,250
this wasn't here so get out there put a

1103
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:25,320
face to it it's funny I occasionally

1104
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:27,210
somebody will poke fun at me for not a

1105
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:30,180
ping pong I play but I'd like the best

1106
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:32,460
source of information that is

1107
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:34,980
have be being social is so critically

1108
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:36,570
important to the role in here if you're

1109
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:38,160
not going to walk around and again talk

1110
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:39,570
about a little really come from the top

1111
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,399
of the stack you're seeing you all the

1112
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:43,740
way down to junior developer help desk

1113
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:45,090
person they it's probably not a great

1114
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:47,609
role role for you so you get

1115
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:51,030
disconnected on the organization I would

1116
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:53,340
say as far as the optimism i think that

1117
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:55,710
the security community yeah I've talked

1118
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:58,470
about it a different way a few different

1119
00:44:55,710 --> 00:45:00,660
tops but it will really a young industry

1120
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:03,350
right people have saw me in source on

1121
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:05,220
Wednesday long as I said is that you

1122
00:45:03,350 --> 00:45:07,980
legitimately in the late eighties

1123
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:09,959
through the 90s were a bunch of you know

1124
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:11,880
teens or young adult or in some cases

1125
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:13,650
kids breaking into shin and then we woke

1126
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:15,060
up in this I really do now epileptic

1127
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:17,820
crap this is like an industry to have

1128
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:20,070
Caroline and so we're really young and a

1129
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:22,200
function of that maturation so which has

1130
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:24,570
been good or someone obviously has been

1131
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:27,210
bad one of the fantastic things that

1132
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:29,250
we've seen is we've seen our community

1133
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:31,920
become more open and accepting so I mean

1134
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:33,780
you know Andy Lucas earlier with holding

1135
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:36,120
conferences it was not that long ago

1136
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:37,680
when you roll up to DEFCON people in OB

1137
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:39,630
were like you were going to be bored you

1138
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:41,129
weren't welcome like it was just a

1139
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:45,240
different experience than that you have

1140
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:46,950
now a lot of adventure and I'm add one

1141
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:48,390
more thing on a jump onto the third rail

1142
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:51,870
yo that'd be really careful up as a

1143
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:53,460
white male to talk about diversity but

1144
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:54,480
if I was in a conference like this five

1145
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:56,550
years ago it would not have been

1146
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,110
twenty-five percent female or this

1147
00:45:56,550 --> 00:46:00,860
outwardly female in case anybody's

1148
00:45:58,110 --> 00:46:03,360
presented differently in the inner room

1149
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:05,670
right that was not our industry our

1150
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:07,320
industry was pretty much white male if

1151
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:08,720
you weren't white male you we felt like

1152
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:10,849
the outsider is nobody knew

1153
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:13,189
work I'm sure so I did quite has some

1154
00:46:10,849 --> 00:46:16,670
stories of those days but that's a

1155
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:18,080
fantastic change we are not a community

1156
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:20,300
that is installer and we'll need one

1157
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:22,640
demographic so I think that's the thing

1158
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:26,000
we're doing well at but that's well by

1159
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:28,339
comparison of we were horrible several

1160
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,220
years ago Chomp well by comparison oh he

1161
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:33,140
should just be done don't sounds bad

1162
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:36,200
yeah we don't suck as bad as we used to

1163
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:38,890
yeah that's going to all take that

1164
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:42,520
that's that's always the first step

1165
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:46,098
acceptance and markup I didn't pirate ah

1166
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:47,270
hi right in general I think one of the

1167
00:46:46,099 --> 00:46:50,000
things we're doing well is we

1168
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:52,160
communicated with each other we share an

1169
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,380
information in ways that we have done

1170
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:57,020
previously on hell even the government's

1171
00:46:54,380 --> 00:47:00,020
stop to get better on and that's that's

1172
00:46:57,020 --> 00:47:01,730
unique and not only are they shared

1173
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:03,020
information better with themselves but

1174
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:05,060
they're sharing information with other

1175
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:07,490
it is important organ we're sharing it

1176
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:09,740
back with that and I think that helps us

1177
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:12,859
all higher end is always being

1178
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:15,080
relatively good at that is Adam will

1179
00:47:12,859 --> 00:47:18,348
probably a test when it was back in his

1180
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:21,080
days of high rent or longer we share

1181
00:47:18,349 --> 00:47:23,330
information a lot we talked about how

1182
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:25,960
good vendors are badly their tax on

1183
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:29,720
quarter and thirty or anything else is

1184
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:31,940
whether the by-product or not we share

1185
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:34,910
indicators are compromised very quickly

1186
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:37,790
amongst ourselves and never I'm seeing

1187
00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:40,040
more initiatives where high red is

1188
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:42,980
pardoned with the business is partnered

1189
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:44,279
with the government that collaborated

1190
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:46,500
shows

1191
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:49,860
of information and this is really help

1192
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:52,140
and not eat any job to get that pay no

1193
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:56,010
fees I think that's one of the things

1194
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:57,420
that while I'm looking better did you

1195
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:59,580
want to add anything Simon yeah I would

1196
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:01,410
just say the collaboration I mean you

1197
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:04,259
would think that security professionals

1198
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:06,029
would not be a very open bunch but I

1199
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:07,860
don't know if it's the therapeutic value

1200
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:11,010
that comes from getting around the table

1201
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:14,550
with fewer stories I hear would you know

1202
00:48:11,010 --> 00:48:16,290
we cross hair yeah and it but that's

1203
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:18,150
refreshing to me because it kind of

1204
00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:20,820
keeps me aligned with what I feel like

1205
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:23,130
my strategy and my priorities are going

1206
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:25,560
to be for the next year it's sort of a

1207
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:27,200
sort of you know throwing things on the

1208
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:29,730
wall making you know having them stick

1209
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:32,609
just kind of reiterating the value of

1210
00:48:29,730 --> 00:48:34,290
what I'm doing day to day so I think

1211
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:36,120
collaboration is what we're doing well

1212
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:38,340
and that we need to do more of it and I

1213
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:39,839
think it needs to be you know security

1214
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:42,180
is not security across every industry

1215
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:43,590
and I constantly seek out people in my

1216
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:45,960
vertical to understand what their

1217
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:47,460
particular problems are because programs

1218
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:49,550
are going to look very different I mean

1219
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:51,690
you have baseline you know firewall

1220
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:53,340
architecture discussions at its you know

1221
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:54,930
security forum like this but when you

1222
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:56,640
get into healthcare you get into banking

1223
00:48:54,930 --> 00:48:59,250
things become very different very

1224
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:01,200
quickly and with the amount of monies

1225
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:03,270
that we get in the nonprofit sector we

1226
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:05,700
will really have to be very careful

1227
00:49:03,270 --> 00:49:06,750
about where we invest annually invest

1228
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:09,390
with

1229
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:12,960
I just have one more question when I

1230
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:14,609
want to hit you sony just said something

1231
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,800
that I think it gave me an anecdote

1232
00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:19,350
humble years ago to drive some pretty

1233
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:21,270
much a good chunk away just hurt I was

1234
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:23,009
standing at the recon two years ago

1235
00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:24,270
there are different kinds of levels in

1236
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:26,070
September each year I think they're

1237
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:29,070
having their sixth one this year and

1238
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:31,350
every year separately they've broken the

1239
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:33,750
record of the including Kentucky Derby

1240
00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:37,319
weekend of the hyatt in Louisville is

1241
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:40,380
about alcohol sold Institute and so they

1242
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:42,870
always have fleets on site we have large

1243
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:44,970
event and like it was like three o'clock

1244
00:49:42,870 --> 00:49:46,830
for 45 min Mourinho's competing in CTF

1245
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:48,450
and I was just kind of taking a walk and

1246
00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:50,190
talk to one of the cops and he's like I

1247
00:49:48,450 --> 00:49:52,830
usually I've never seen anything like

1248
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:54,600
this before like you like that sweetly

1249
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:56,670
obliterated people playing with complex

1250
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:58,850
variants of chess like some guys are

1251
00:49:56,670 --> 00:50:01,470
talking about like Heidi headers and

1252
00:49:58,850 --> 00:50:03,839
every excuse this is not something you

1253
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:08,520
just vacation other and it's only on

1254
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:11,580
vacation is just cool alright so we're

1255
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:13,050
drinking will yeah it really nice out

1256
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:14,500
drinking every what bunch of alcohol

1257
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:16,990
that was the takeaway

1258
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:18,760
about a functional social out foundation

1259
00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:20,680
is that they excel in etiquette so

1260
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:23,620
before we can go all sit around the

1261
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:26,200
table and have a beer i7 laptop question

1262
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:28,569
afro so how would you say that your team

1263
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:30,640
is or your team can impacts the

1264
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:35,550
community both local and abroad John do

1265
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:39,400
you want to start without yeah so uh

1266
00:50:35,550 --> 00:50:42,430
we're dying here and here is that I

1267
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:43,900
don't not even explain Anaheim I see

1268
00:50:42,430 --> 00:50:46,660
chapter president I think we were

1269
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:49,300
workers labor laws we have no chapter I

1270
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:51,819
mean we just don't stop it's pretty much

1271
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:53,590
the mission is in size every day two of

1272
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:56,230
us are finishing up at HT is Peavy who

1273
00:50:53,590 --> 00:50:59,140
can't great long ago started loudly

1274
00:50:56,230 --> 00:51:02,350
about 90 people here medical offices in

1275
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:05,140
there every heavy literally just don't

1276
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:06,490
stop every single day being advocated we

1277
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:09,100
get on the barnes and noble some votes

1278
00:51:06,490 --> 00:51:10,509
on the group and basically just work to

1279
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:11,980
teach people like how the 3d

1280
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:14,320
internationally understands what's doing

1281
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:16,480
for programming is security but

1282
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:18,430
advocating my god dinner with the mayor

1283
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:20,260
and next week to talk about the economy

1284
00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:22,480
development direction cybersecurity and

1285
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:24,580
two weeks obviously one of the person

1286
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:26,860
who we volunteered via community courts

1287
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:30,520
council to help children with shua

1288
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:33,650
congregation initiative and sin as well

1289
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:38,569
as disabilities so nonprofit work

1290
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:41,839
belarus abilities so to summarize it

1291
00:51:38,569 --> 00:51:44,299
don't hack the world and have a good

1292
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:46,160
time for you each other I guess along

1293
00:51:44,299 --> 00:51:49,069
the way inception is where you're going

1294
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:51,759
my CEO is a roast and I even have a

1295
00:51:49,069 --> 00:51:53,808
party response people everybody that

1296
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:56,329
just you have anything about how you're

1297
00:51:53,809 --> 00:51:58,220
impacting the local scrutiny because

1298
00:51:56,329 --> 00:52:04,730
everybody is it because it's because we

1299
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:10,220
had a 144 divided people speak like it's

1300
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:12,589
exactly except I think that you a always

1301
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:14,538
push the envelope and then talk about it

1302
00:52:12,589 --> 00:52:17,680
but one of the problems is industry guys

1303
00:52:14,539 --> 00:52:19,910
they got caught in this run its end

1304
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:21,950
because people that aren't new to the

1305
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:23,390
industry or are new to the industry want
