1
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:13,219
drinking out of the silo the Inca rods

2
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:15,440
through the automation explain exactly

3
00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:16,910
what we mean by that a little bit first

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,850
we're just going to Google quick

5
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:22,550
introductions so but in philly and I'm

6
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:24,620
Astrid engineer rabbit 7 and a lot of my

7
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:28,160
day to day is spending time doing

8
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:31,880
definitely floor tuck belt and you know

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,489
while I am honey new on this computer to

10
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:37,670
charge its part long as though the

11
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:39,818
ringer I'm Justin without on the

12
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:42,620
information simulated rapid7

13
00:00:39,819 --> 00:00:47,420
specifically overseeing the operations

14
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:51,140
and engineering punctuation so let's

15
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:54,499
dive right in going back to the title

16
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:58,519
and slide what we need by silent silent

17
00:00:54,499 --> 00:01:00,859
automation broad automation silent

18
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:05,110
automation we all know how to apologize

19
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:08,180
miss okay think about a tool that does a

20
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:09,920
specific and sort of categorically

21
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,770
within instead of tasks on floor

22
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,469
abilities fire one it's automatic most

23
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:18,460
tasks for you vulnerability scanners

24
00:01:15,469 --> 00:01:20,408
automatically discovering assets

25
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:24,350
discovering the corner abilities

26
00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:25,760
advertising them and reporter Rob

27
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:29,550
automation on the other

28
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:32,300
like a mousetrap you're taking disparate

29
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:35,310
systems that all do and specialize in

30
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:37,410
different things and tying them together

31
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:40,530
and tying them is together in the

32
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:42,570
context of a broader workflow process

33
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:45,090
we're going to dive into some use cases

34
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:52,470
later on that sort of mean generic

35
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:55,200
operating definitions so why are you

36
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:57,360
talking about broad automation what sort

37
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,860
of problems that we're trying to solve

38
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:04,680
with it there's a pretty well-documented

39
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:06,770
shortage of security staff in the US

40
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:10,530
across the globe the u.s. monomers valve

41
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:12,630
from insolence 209,000 unfilled but

42
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,190
needed security positions across the

43
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:17,850
balloons about a million according to

44
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:20,579
cisco and and flip side to that problem

45
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:22,350
is you know we as defenders and security

46
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:25,050
practitioners definitely getting better

47
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:29,160
at our jobs in this case when I are

48
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:32,160
getting better responding to incidents

49
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:34,260
but attackers are getting better faster

50
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,459
and that's a problem and that's sort of

51
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:40,290
a gap amina focus on the things i hope

52
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:42,360
you look back in the industry kind of

53
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:44,940
see that major focus in the 1990s

54
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,650
alkenes but it's focused on meeting

55
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:50,400
prevention so you had tools like

56
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:52,890
firewall maybe ids IPS and either a

57
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,510
prime example of styling automation you

58
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:56,488
can automate within their own world

59
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:58,739
context of the firewall you can automate

60
00:02:56,489 --> 00:03:01,530
pools and policy deployments same with

61
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:03,300
ids example heavy and maybe you could

62
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:05,459
change some response activities for that

63
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:08,310
but you couldn't really do much more so

64
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:11,519
maybe a firewall talked or 90s but not

65
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:13,650
much more be on the security list and

66
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,140
then moving to late 2000s we kind of had

67
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,210
this

68
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:19,790
to detection so we had on favorite tool

69
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:21,560
to sim and you know it gave us access to

70
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:23,690
all the data all of our event sources

71
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,390
and you know we can build rules and do

72
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:29,540
all this fun stuff and but still limited

73
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:31,160
in the kind of detection days and then

74
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:33,859
moving into the 2010 to come to move

75
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,959
back toward prevention again but now it

76
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:38,630
has a new name club next generation so

77
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:41,060
you had your next generation EV so fire

78
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:44,090
I'd sandboxing and experience of

79
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:47,180
firewalls backup application firewalls

80
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:49,190
and we're still kind of limited in the

81
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:52,489
context and not really focusing on a

82
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:57,380
little skraelings that just takes us to

83
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:59,239
broad automation and you know sort of

84
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:01,549
going back to what Julian was talking

85
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:03,920
about before in the context of the

86
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:06,470
security lifecycle the trends in the

87
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,059
industry focused on prevention a lot of

88
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:10,190
tooling around prevention a lot of money

89
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:12,650
going into prevention we have security

90
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:14,660
practitioners today we know we talked

91
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:16,630
about how sort of short sight of that

92
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:21,610
one now we need to focus on detection

93
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:23,990
touring a lot of money back but in this

94
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:26,390
life cycle that we're all familiar when

95
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:27,979
it seems like the last stage hasn't

96
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:32,150
gotten a lot of love in terms of tooling

97
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:34,700
and automation and budget and if this is

98
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:36,890
a sort of the second aspect of brought

99
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:39,080
on you were talking about automating

100
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:41,690
full lifecycle whatever we can for any

101
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:44,090
given process and feed it into your

102
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:45,950
detection tools and then take that out

103
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:50,039
of your detection tool and manually run

104
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:54,610
some process to correctly respond to

105
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:57,040
and before we move on just one of issues

106
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:58,360
and caveats we're not saying we're going

107
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,250
to automate everything one hundred

108
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,410
percent we're not saying this is a

109
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:05,199
silver bullet we're not saying people

110
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:08,949
are doing this today what we are saying

111
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:11,530
is this is a basic foundational building

112
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:13,389
block that not to me in part of every

113
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:15,549
security program whenever we have the

114
00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:17,110
opportunity to put it there this is

115
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:20,770
something we really should have been

116
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:24,250
focusing on years ago so that we could

117
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:25,990
free up the time that our security

118
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,090
personnel have day to day so they can

119
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:31,389
focus on the things that humans are good

120
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:33,369
at and creative thought engaging in

121
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:37,290
dynamic processes that are predictable

122
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:41,610
repeatable and also writing more code to

123
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:44,169
further refine your automated processes

124
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:45,430
so before we go on tiny strategies that

125
00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:48,190
we have we have to cover some basic

126
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:50,050
assumptions any tools that you have or

127
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:51,460
plan on getting we're going to have that

128
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:54,340
you can get I capabilities so that you

129
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:56,830
can interact with them in a automated

130
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:58,419
fashion they have to be open and rich

131
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:00,130
enough to do a minimal job they're not

132
00:05:58,419 --> 00:06:02,139
going to everything that you want right

133
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:04,150
off the box so you're going to have to

134
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:06,789
you know kind of tie different systems

135
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:09,250
together to do one thing to example this

136
00:06:06,789 --> 00:06:10,930
at rapid7 is we have no bunch of

137
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:13,000
different data sources for our users and

138
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:15,729
as great team you what is it going to

139
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,580
consolidate all of that so we integrated

140
00:06:15,729 --> 00:06:20,469
our single sign-on provider KPI if you

141
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:22,090
join us provider and other tools and

142
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:24,160
vegetable together to this blending

143
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,810
systems that we have one single source

144
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:30,099
for our users and then we start using

145
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:32,169
that brother another assumption is

146
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:33,820
programming skills to be able to

147
00:06:32,169 --> 00:06:36,520
interrupt the API is until these tools

148
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:37,840
you have to go to program you know you

149
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,510
ought to be a bleep row grammar you know

150
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,638
rapid7 our team from big on passions

151
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:44,820
that we can program it to be taught just

152
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:48,250
the way of thinking is what we're big on

153
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:50,740
and the last assumption is it's time and

154
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:52,960
you stuff problem issues as easy as

155
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,979
applying a tool of solid copy you're

156
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,659
going to have to tie different tools

157
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:56,400
together

158
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,800
you're going to have to you know figure

159
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,500
all that out it takes time a very handy

160
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,000
oh it's worth it in the long run to be

161
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:08,040
able to have all your tools tied

162
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:10,710
together in an automated fashion so so

163
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:13,470
the core features of strategy behind

164
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:15,200
brought on mission again I'm talking

165
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:18,780
about automating repeatable processes

166
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:20,280
that you might be doing man today we're

167
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:22,140
all starting about automating across

168
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,789
again from disparate systems and tools

169
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:25,500
but also across different students

170
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:27,480
whether those are teams within your

171
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:30,750
security organization or between

172
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:34,410
security and I teeny and DevOps an HR

173
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:37,500
marketing I'm sure you can think of some

174
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:40,290
processing on a date in a mutiny phases

175
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:42,120
where you have certain rules and

176
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:44,730
security team partnering with certain

177
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,860
roles and adnan street if any of those

178
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:50,660
steps in that workflow are repeated and

179
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:53,820
predictable why not abated and then

180
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:55,950
another caveat some of you might be

181
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:58,950
thinking well try going on me of

182
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:59,400
everything it's kind of scary or talking

183
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,259
about

184
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:04,020
automating certain actions may not be

185
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:06,509
the changes to certain systems yes that

186
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:09,180
can be a little scary but let's extend

187
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:10,830
that idea and think about why not how to

188
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,870
make full backs of those automatic

189
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:16,650
chambers again for talking about

190
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:18,539
predictable actions some changes we

191
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:20,940
should know and be able to predict what

192
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:23,280
you will match to those changes should

193
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:26,060
be too quick a problem that might be

194
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:29,400
agreed by one of these automated steps

195
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:30,180
again want to highlight that we're not

196
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,218
going to be able to automate everything

197
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:34,260
if you do have a workflow though where

198
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:37,020
you can automate ninety ninety-five

199
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:39,059
percent of it but your organization

200
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,919
isn't comfortable with automating

201
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:42,900
certain steps especially the steps that

202
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:45,079
make changes to systems throw in some

203
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:50,040
manual steps and push button approval

204
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:52,920
stages to to fit your organization's

205
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,510
needs and we'll have some in there next

206
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,640
to use cases we have some ideas for

207
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:58,650
manual steps that we see that probably

208
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:02,180
will come on yeah probably reasonable to

209
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:03,870
have a feel just in case so use cases

210
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:06,510
vulnerability management and patch

211
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:08,190
management show of hands how many people

212
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:10,560
have dealt with this or deal with this

213
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:12,980
today it's a pretty common use case

214
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,779
absolutely necessary to any organization

215
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:17,790
and for these use cases we have this

216
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:21,480
legend down here Green stages are

217
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:24,980
automated orange are manual and and this

218
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:27,660
is in our eyes sort of a average current

219
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,980
state and a lot of companies you have

220
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:31,319
your vulnerability scanner it's

221
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:33,110
automating that stage you're manually

222
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,850
submitting tickets and change requests

223
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:37,650
you might have a patch management tool

224
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:39,839
where you know system administrators

225
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:42,360
queuing up patches to apply to systems

226
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,620
at a later date then that that person

227
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,390
will send out a notification to the

228
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:47,130
company or potentially impacted users

229
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:48,540
say hey patches are coming down your

230
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:51,089
system is going to reboot in 24 hours

231
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:53,730
just so you know patch management tool

232
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:55,380
applies those patches long skin re scans

233
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:57,180
to validate that the patches took and

234
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,570
then someone goes in and closes out

235
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:01,520
those two tickets

236
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:03,110
this is clunky this is going to take a

237
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,030
lot of time and it's not the most

238
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:08,210
exciting thing to do every day or every

239
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:10,490
week why not automate as much as

240
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:12,110
possible there there are plenty of

241
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:14,060
opportunities especially with modern

242
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:16,220
tools modern ticketing tools and

243
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:20,810
vulnerability management tools to tie

244
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:24,860
these things together so that any time

245
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:26,989
you can predict these vulnerabilities

246
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:28,910
from my vulnerability scanning tool they

247
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:31,070
pair up with these patches in my patch

248
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:32,839
management tool let's get them stage

249
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:34,490
let's get them rolled out in two weeks

250
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:37,040
between these times we know what our

251
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:40,130
maintenance window is we can add that

252
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,770
into this automated workflow and we have

253
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:45,200
minimal human intervention if this is

254
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:48,050
scaring you though I might scare you a

255
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,850
little more if you want to get a little

256
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:51,469
more creative here and you're thinking

257
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:53,150
well my organization we can't tolerate

258
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:56,390
having workstations out there that

259
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:58,310
remain unpatched for two weeks we have

260
00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:01,130
users who aren't connecting to the

261
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:02,479
corporate network very often and you

262
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:05,240
know the last time we saw them they were

263
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,520
missing the past two months of Microsoft

264
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,320
Patch Tuesday updates if you have

265
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,910
notifications going out to those users

266
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,380
saying hey you need to work with IT to

267
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:14,329
get patched in two weeks or your network

268
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:16,550
access gets revoke you can tie this

269
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:19,040
workflow into your network management

270
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:20,780
systems or firewalls to automatically

271
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,310
quarantine that assets so it can't

272
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,380
interact with any systems on your

273
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:26,089
corporate network until it gets patched

274
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:29,060
and until your vulnerability scanner

275
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:31,910
tool validates that the patches talk I

276
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:32,900
might be freaking some of you out let's

277
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:35,540
say you don't want to automate

278
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:37,760
everything you you don't want those

279
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:39,620
patches to just go out willy-nilly throw

280
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,510
in a manual step where an IT

281
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:43,640
administrator someone from the security

282
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:45,560
team used to go in and push approve on

283
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:48,110
that change request in order for that

284
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:50,119
workflow to proceed going forward and

285
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:52,700
again any of these stages you can just

286
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:55,550
throw in manual steps or leave any stage

287
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:58,340
entirely manual if your organization

288
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:59,769
deems it too risky to make these changes

289
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:01,420
on the fly like that

290
00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:03,489
and I just want to highlight to you know

291
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:05,949
we were talking about tying together for

292
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:09,040
different types of systems it's very

293
00:12:05,949 --> 00:12:13,149
doable stuff we do and are doing more of

294
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:16,420
it rapid7 every day and it really can

295
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:18,519
help your team's focus on more important

296
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:21,040
things to help mature your security

297
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:22,869
program and to deal with alerts that are

298
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:27,879
coming in on a day to day basis this

299
00:12:22,869 --> 00:12:29,889
really is a time saver so in other use

300
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:32,199
cases I mean much simpler than what

301
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:34,239
justin has covered but it's a firewall

302
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:35,738
configuration management so that goes

303
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:37,720
from defining your policies and

304
00:12:35,739 --> 00:12:39,579
standards and rules configuring those

305
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,559
firewalls and you know hopefully

306
00:12:39,579 --> 00:12:42,849
auditing those policies and the rules

307
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:44,559
and making sure they stick to the

308
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:47,679
standard and then reacting to any

309
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:49,509
deviations you know all of this is very

310
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:51,189
manual across lot of teams you'll have a

311
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:52,839
team may be defining the policies and

312
00:12:51,189 --> 00:12:55,209
standards another team you know actually

313
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:56,889
writing the rules and then maybe have

314
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:59,768
another team outing policies and rules

315
00:12:56,889 --> 00:13:01,809
and then they're going to respond to you

316
00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:03,639
know having another team maybe fix those

317
00:13:01,809 --> 00:13:05,829
deviations or alert or some kind of

318
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:07,199
process around that and you know you're

319
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:11,049
covering a lot of tools a lot of teams

320
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:13,299
and you can kind of see this is pretty

321
00:13:11,049 --> 00:13:16,689
hectic and you could definitely have

322
00:13:13,299 --> 00:13:19,480
some room for automation so here let's

323
00:13:16,689 --> 00:13:21,219
say we have a policy in place so this is

324
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,709
your defining polishing standards for

325
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:26,529
your like web servers who have orch 80

326
00:13:23,709 --> 00:13:30,489
and 443 open to public addresses so it's

327
00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:33,189
not RFC 1918 addresses and you drop

328
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:34,929
those policies and then hopefully you

329
00:13:33,189 --> 00:13:36,639
have some kind of a movie tool or

330
00:13:34,929 --> 00:13:38,199
something a little bit easier more

331
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,759
automated than actually going to the

332
00:13:38,199 --> 00:13:42,609
firewall on writing the rule and command

333
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:44,769
line and then you have an automated

334
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:46,629
process of going through scanning those

335
00:13:44,769 --> 00:13:48,399
rules and policies and making sure it's

336
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:51,040
all standard but then you come up with

337
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,290
oh there's now this rule that has 422

338
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:56,139
open to some random public IP addresses

339
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:58,480
that you don't own and fall now you're

340
00:13:56,139 --> 00:14:00,119
stuck like what do we do so you have

341
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,230
automated process that goes through

342
00:14:00,119 --> 00:14:04,389
alerts or information security team and

343
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:06,549
maybe hopefully automatically they're

344
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:08,649
coming out that rule track down through

345
00:14:06,549 --> 00:14:09,000
your config management repo team who put

346
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:11,760
that

347
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,800
win and following up with that and you

348
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,590
doing that process and then you have

349
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:18,630
ability to go back so during this

350
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:20,970
process you find that oh this we needed

351
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:22,320
this for some troubleshooting probably a

352
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:25,770
bad for this use case because I don't a

353
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,450
white one 22 ok but you have the ability

354
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:29,579
to roll back and then put that roll back

355
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:30,960
in place there's simple fashion versus

356
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:35,100
having a bunch of tickets open and

357
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:38,880
manually following that up and you have

358
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:43,200
any questions so far so another use case

359
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:48,960
as I'm sorry good so your automation

360
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:52,190
tied to keep your product such that if

361
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:55,110
you were to like swap out your firewall

362
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:56,850
we have to change a certain amount of

363
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:58,680
automation you know is there like the

364
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:01,810
kind of life cover like a plug-in layer

365
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:05,630
that allows you to

366
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:07,609
something like that has now so at least

367
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:09,590
on our team we try to when we write

368
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:11,030
services for those types of tasks we

369
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:12,860
kind of make a generic enough that like

370
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:14,329
oh I want to block something this and

371
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:16,370
then we'd write plugins like you're

372
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:18,260
saying for this particular tool and then

373
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:20,900
when we're looking to purchase either

374
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:22,939
replace a tool or a new tool we look for

375
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:24,620
stuff that has similar API capabilities

376
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:26,540
so that you know we're not stuck and

377
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:28,010
like now we replaced our firewall but we

378
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:29,870
can't actually block anything through an

379
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:34,819
API so that's kind of always in our

380
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:36,500
mindset to be able to do that yeah so

381
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:39,140
another use case as defenders is

382
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:41,480
responding to fishing alerts and stuff

383
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:44,439
it's pretty common we're all doing it

384
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:46,430
and it's it's crazy because you

385
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,820
hopefully maybe have an automated tool

386
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:50,959
that where to maybe you have your users

387
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:53,000
send you a phishing email study for you

388
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,270
to analyze you have a bunch of tabs open

389
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,770
for different analysis tools virustotal

390
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:59,930
malware some kind of sandboxing to see

391
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:02,689
if there's any kind of malicious

392
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:04,489
attachments and then urls go to Europe

393
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:07,010
riri to get a screenshot to see what

394
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:08,720
that website looks like then you have a

395
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:11,750
message trace to see who else got that

396
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,550
email and then track that down notify

397
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:15,350
any users who may have opened the email

398
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:17,930
and see if they interacted and then you

399
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:19,280
have to follow up with that once you

400
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:21,380
deem that you know there's a bunch of

401
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:23,030
malicious domains you have to reach out

402
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:25,370
to abuse context so they can shut that

403
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:27,740
domain down and then you also have to

404
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:29,450
update your prevention tools for any of

405
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:32,630
indicators compromise so whether it be

406
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:34,880
your firewall AV spam filters what have

407
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:37,400
you and you know a lot is his manual

408
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,620
when I first started rapid7 this was a

409
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,750
big chunk of our time initially coming

410
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:44,930
up with you know an SOP for it was all

411
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:47,060
manual and so we switched to a

412
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:48,620
significantly automated fashion and it's

413
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:51,680
going to kick us off into thinking

414
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:54,350
broader and automation so we tied in our

415
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,810
you know our web api so we can

416
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:59,060
automatically pull in web phishing

417
00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:00,770
emails and I have great services that

418
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:02,449
analyze the links the attachments

419
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:04,459
submitted to virustotal get the results

420
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:07,250
back we've created a service that takes

421
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:07,580
screenshots of websites and they kind of

422
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,869
do

423
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:12,169
automatically instead of opening a tab

424
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:14,540
and your query you can start tracing

425
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:16,760
messages automatically assuming again

426
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:18,589
that there's an API for it and you get a

427
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,089
feel for who else got this kind of

428
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:23,839
message based on the subject and the

429
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:25,280
from and you know you can maybe if you

430
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:28,220
have a confidence level okay I'm eighty

431
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,020
percent sure that this message is

432
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:32,540
malicious you can automatically delete

433
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:34,879
that email from the mailbox or on the

434
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:37,310
flipside have a push button so if you

435
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,540
have like a GUI representation and you

436
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:41,270
don't feel comfortable automatically

437
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:42,980
deleting an email like push this button

438
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:44,960
because you know we're seventy percent

439
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:47,450
sure or eighty percent sure and then we

440
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,580
can go from there automatically emailing

441
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:51,410
users to say oh we notice this phishing

442
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:52,820
email and you've got it please let us

443
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:56,000
know if you interact with it in any way

444
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:58,280
and again automatically notifying abuse

445
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,390
contacts and updating your firewalls and

446
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:02,120
your any of your tools for any

447
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:04,310
indicators of compromise that you found

448
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:06,709
during your analysis and by automating

449
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:08,450
all this you can start focusing on you

450
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:10,760
know what kinds of emails are phishing

451
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:12,530
emails am I getting who's being targeted

452
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,210
who's you know how can we use this

453
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:16,580
information to maybe even fish our own

454
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:18,410
company for better campaigns and you're

455
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:20,000
not focused on like trying to always

456
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:23,210
react to a phishing email you're kind of

457
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,290
taking a proactive stance and you know

458
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:27,980
that's what we're trying to fight so

459
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:29,210
we're trying to do rapid7 so next we

460
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:31,430
have some bonus screenshots and I'm

461
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:32,870
apologize if they don't come up with

462
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:35,960
kind of just did it this morning but uh

463
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:37,610
we have this QE front end with people so

464
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,230
I rapid said that we have users submit

465
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:41,240
phishing emails that they see I think

466
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:42,830
it's suspicious or fishing and then we

467
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,990
have our services automatically parse

468
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:46,639
those and it's represented in a GUI this

469
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:49,550
is the first one where it kind of comes

470
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,140
up as a ticket and a workflow and in

471
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:53,840
this next one which will be pretty bad

472
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:55,160
but it's you know we if you can see they

473
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,560
have some screenshots of any websites

474
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:59,060
and URLs we automatically pull

475
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:01,190
virustotal and get the results for that

476
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:02,960
and it's all represented in a single

477
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:07,030
page so that we're not having you know

478
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:09,770
six tabs open for all these things and

479
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:11,810
yeah so it's you know he's kind of do

480
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:13,539
analysis from there and we found that it

481
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:15,190
saves us a bunch of time

482
00:19:13,539 --> 00:19:16,629
other than again like having all this

483
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:18,909
running around like a chicken with its

484
00:19:16,629 --> 00:19:22,779
head cut off which is a lot of times

485
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:24,369
what defenders do so so before I go into

486
00:19:22,779 --> 00:19:26,109
the next use case I just want to

487
00:19:24,369 --> 00:19:28,178
highlight quickly about the fishing

488
00:19:26,109 --> 00:19:32,830
analysis use case how that whole

489
00:19:28,179 --> 00:19:35,830
workflow again we automated to a great

490
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:37,869
extent the whole security lifecycle for

491
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:39,428
that workflow we have prevention tools

492
00:19:37,869 --> 00:19:41,859
already in place spam and phishing

493
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:43,690
filters a lot of phishing emails get

494
00:19:41,859 --> 00:19:45,100
past them so we have detection

495
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:47,320
mechanisms in place that we've automated

496
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:49,869
and that detection mechanism and that

497
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:52,029
were close to fold our employees they

498
00:19:49,869 --> 00:19:54,580
will manually notify us they'll send us

499
00:19:52,029 --> 00:19:56,139
phishing emails to a certain mailbox but

500
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:58,149
then this tool we built will

501
00:19:56,139 --> 00:20:00,309
automatically notify us when an employee

502
00:19:58,149 --> 00:20:02,529
has reported a phishing email that got

503
00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:06,340
passed our filters we automate all the

504
00:20:02,529 --> 00:20:09,399
analysis and then in the final stages we

505
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:11,678
go in and we automate correction we add

506
00:20:09,399 --> 00:20:13,209
the sending email address of that

507
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,789
phishing email to our spam and phishing

508
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:17,320
filter so it'll get blocked again and

509
00:20:15,789 --> 00:20:19,929
we're adding those indications of

510
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,939
compromise to some of our other tools

511
00:20:19,929 --> 00:20:25,149
like a file hashes and URLs to web

512
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:27,429
proxies and things like that so we're

513
00:20:25,149 --> 00:20:28,928
automating that correction phase so that

514
00:20:27,429 --> 00:20:31,720
it feeds back into the beginning

515
00:20:28,929 --> 00:20:34,139
prevention and it just continues

516
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:39,789
iterating on itself and it's in effect

517
00:20:34,139 --> 00:20:42,099
so anyway Next use case access

518
00:20:39,789 --> 00:20:47,590
management we've been dealing with this

519
00:20:42,099 --> 00:20:50,229
forever but for us we're trying to come

520
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:52,809
up with flexible and still secure ways

521
00:20:50,229 --> 00:20:56,470
to provision access especially to

522
00:20:52,809 --> 00:20:59,918
critical production systems so you know

523
00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:03,729
we had this problem where we're trying

524
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:06,729
to both allow people who need access to

525
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:08,470
production servers to get access when

526
00:21:06,729 --> 00:21:11,169
they need it without giving them

527
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:13,330
persistent access without just having

528
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:16,090
their account on there until the end of

529
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:18,220
time we felt that was too risky and so

530
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:23,168
you know we've been we've been taking

531
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:24,100
this process which is probably automated

532
00:21:23,169 --> 00:21:26,860
to this extent it

533
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:30,850
of companies and and we took a step

534
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:32,918
further and so that a user an

535
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:35,439
administrator or an engineer can log

536
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:37,030
into a web portal they go to request

537
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,179
access which is pretty standard in a

538
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:42,010
ticketing system but in this use case

539
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:44,289
they specify I need access to these five

540
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:45,760
servers for just an hour and they click

541
00:21:44,289 --> 00:21:47,530
a button and their account gets

542
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:51,370
automatically provision just on those

543
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:53,860
systems and after provisioning occurs

544
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:55,659
and they log in for the first time their

545
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:58,809
activities being monitored at a granular

546
00:21:55,660 --> 00:22:01,240
level and that activity audit log when

547
00:21:58,809 --> 00:22:03,280
the user is done on that system gets

548
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,690
sent off to a security analyst and they

549
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,850
just check out to make sure everything's

550
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:08,830
kosher in this case we're talking about

551
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:11,350
critical production systems we really

552
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:13,090
want to be careful about even for

553
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:17,100
authorized users what changes they're

554
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:19,780
making on these servers and then yeah

555
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:23,789
problem with some of those type systems

556
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:23,789
is that a person never locks off

557
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:32,450
um so about applications yeah so we

558
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:35,960
could throw in a step there to kill

559
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:37,760
sessions you know that that's a great

560
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,170
point to you weren't really yeah Whitney

561
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,370
javi out that that won't break anything

562
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:41,750
because you know you have to kind of do

563
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:43,489
the information gathering and say okay

564
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:45,530
these users will need to be logged in

565
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:47,030
and definitely can think of a good use

566
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:49,250
case why that would happen but again

567
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:50,690
like you would say okay these users to

568
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:52,220
login we don't want to kill their

569
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:54,290
sessions because they're made in

570
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:55,850
practices yeah and just another thought

571
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:57,470
to before you even automatically kill

572
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:58,820
the session send out a few automated

573
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:00,110
notifications we soon you're still

574
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:02,240
logged in do you still need to be logged

575
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:04,699
in after five notification attempts all

576
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:09,890
right we're filling your access welcome

577
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:11,210
good question and for the last slide you

578
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:15,950
know we've gone over a lot of technical

579
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:17,630
use cases and for for some teams we

580
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:21,010
think that when we're talking about

581
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:23,780
automation we're focusing a lot on

582
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:26,540
automating the workflows of a security

583
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:28,389
operation center or a technical security

584
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:32,420
team but really we should be thinking

585
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:34,040
broader if I can across the entire

586
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:36,590
security organization so if you have a

587
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:39,020
governance and compliance team that is

588
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:41,689
getting out a new policy to a company

589
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:44,120
like an acceptable use policy automate

590
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:46,250
that workflow so the document from your

591
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:48,620
document management system gets pushed

592
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:50,360
out to all applicable employees you're

593
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:52,429
sending reminders automatically you're

594
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:55,340
tracking how many reminders haven't sent

595
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:56,930
so that after 10 reminders let's say if

596
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:59,570
an employee hasn't acknowledged or

597
00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:01,520
signed than your policy you escalate to

598
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:04,610
their manager maybe you escalate to the

599
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,200
security team again and after 20-30

600
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:10,040
reminders if they still haven't signed

601
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:11,930
it quarantine the Machine revoke their

602
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:14,570
network access once you get

603
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:17,090
acknowledgments and signatures move them

604
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:18,830
from the quarantine and track that all

605
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:22,350
in real time as those acknowledgments

606
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:25,289
come in it's yes sir

607
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:27,600
with the automation a good film sending

608
00:24:25,289 --> 00:24:29,070
the daily reminders how would you say

609
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,949
they acknowledge the rate tends to be

610
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:35,939
how frequently do you find yourself

611
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:38,190
we're here the party places for us it's

612
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:41,970
been pretty great I haven't looked at

613
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:44,789
our resellers for a most recent campaign

614
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:46,740
I recent campaign it was pretty

615
00:24:44,789 --> 00:24:49,410
successful I don't like we made me add a

616
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:51,299
few stragglers that had her reason maybe

617
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:53,280
two I definitely escalate their managers

618
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:54,690
but we didn't have a policy in place for

619
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:57,000
warranty we don't want to just

620
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:59,039
quarantine someone's box without like

621
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,510
having that notice before like that if

622
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:03,210
you don't sign it we're going to

623
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:06,350
quarantine your box so something that we

624
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:06,350
could definitely work into the future

625
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:14,260
but yeah again we're tying together a

626
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:16,210
lot of disparate systems to free up our

627
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:20,070
security resources time to focus on

628
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:23,850
better things and that's it in summation

629
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:27,310
automated like that yes of course any

630
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:34,230
questions we have an answer yes so

631
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:34,230
across there's always a full list within

632
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:50,980
many was for that last case you mean so

633
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:54,580
for the vulnerability management use

634
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:59,650
case for example and for others really

635
00:25:54,580 --> 00:26:01,060
the systems we're building our I mean

636
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:02,980
itís fair to say there are full stack

637
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:04,480
you know there's the web layer we have a

638
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:07,270
database layer in that database is

639
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,520
tracking different approvals and they

640
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:11,080
normal is its North at having the

641
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,330
database helps normalize all that data

642
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:16,179
to so we're not just stuck in the data

643
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:19,090
format of the ITSM tool where that

644
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:21,240
approval is clicked and it helps us to

645
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:24,129
maintain that record as well a case

646
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,930
changes are made in the original system

647
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:27,790
we can have our own source of record to

648
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:30,580
double check things if that makes sense

649
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:31,780
yeah and also like we create when we're

650
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:33,340
creating the service we define the

651
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:34,930
business rules of these are the types of

652
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:36,639
people we want for author for the

653
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:38,590
escalations and for their approvals and

654
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,600
then I mentioned the user service that

655
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:41,919
we kind of built and based on those

656
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,590
business rules it will call it the

657
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:47,050
service will pull in okay i need the IT

658
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:48,310
director it'll pull in that and we can

659
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:50,290
start working off those work clothes so

660
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:51,730
nothing's really hard coded as far as

661
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:53,500
the person but maybe the role was

662
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:55,160
hard-coded that we need to contact this

663
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:58,980
person

664
00:26:55,160 --> 00:27:01,500
you use any kind of common rules

665
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:04,020
framework across all of these different

666
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:09,560
workflows or are these kinds of kind of

667
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:12,060
separate programs right now it's pretty

668
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:14,129
pretty separate like we are just getting

669
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:15,540
like growing our team growing all the

670
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:18,120
services that were coming up with and

671
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:18,930
peach kind of person on our team is kind

672
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,610
of come up with their own thing and

673
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:23,880
we're starting to unify things a lot

674
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:25,560
better by having you know one single

675
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,480
repository for our users and all are the

676
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,980
singular positive for our assets we're

677
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,890
not defining all that information

678
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:33,570
multiple times so like that's kind of

679
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:35,610
starting the head yeah well that's a

680
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:38,399
conversation we actually had pretty

681
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:41,010
recently again you're having a business

682
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:43,500
rules repository of sources because and

683
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:45,600
again to like when when you start

684
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,860
automating these processes you're not

685
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,570
going to automate everything from start

686
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:50,669
to finish you'll do it piecemeal and

687
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:52,470
then once you get one workflow automated

688
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:54,510
and then a separate workflow automated

689
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:59,070
you can start focusing on that sort of

690
00:27:54,510 --> 00:28:01,770
central business rules policy system and

691
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:04,169
repository for it and and that just

692
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:05,580
speaks back to the idea of once you

693
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:08,790
start automating things more broadly

694
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:10,590
like this you're able to iterate on that

695
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:12,180
automation and mature your security

696
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:13,620
program much more easily than you

697
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:18,330
otherwise would have if everything we're

698
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:20,699
still just manual so it seems like the

699
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:22,409
moment your focus is you're saying

700
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,120
automate it and

701
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:26,940
the extent that you're not comfortable

702
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:29,070
with the the automations effective

703
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:32,250
person function stickers previous data

704
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:34,820
and make clear exemption is also have

705
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:37,080
you gone past that point where on those

706
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:39,480
processes that you have fully automate

707
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:41,639
you take it as proof sets out all that

708
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:44,040
you actually have done anomaly detection

709
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:45,480
rather rules to kind of figure out when

710
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:47,820
the automated furthers what your name

711
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:50,250
percent when is going wrong what you

712
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:54,060
need to do work rates on it and what

713
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:56,640
lets you learn that that's a good point

714
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:58,050
and we will definitely start figuring

715
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,940
that out as far as like working that

716
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:01,530
into our services like we haven't we're

717
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:03,630
just getting like started and like these

718
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:05,070
all these ideas and once we start having

719
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:06,180
more mature automated process that's

720
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:12,470
definitely something that we need to

721
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:12,470
like start looking out for so can you

722
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:16,380
everybody is kind of like Robbins

723
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:18,300
just so we understand you know the size

724
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:21,920
of your organization number of users and

725
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,919
people information

726
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:30,620
what we've done three of us so far built

727
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:32,390
a good number of tools so we have

728
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:33,860
another person focusing on just one

729
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:37,330
workflow and they're off on their own

730
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:37,330
for kind of not on the

731
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:51,280
so rapid sevens roughly like 700 800

732
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:53,680
people and our security team always the

733
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:56,710
engineering operations side is for

734
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:58,090
before for four of us and you know we

735
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:59,250
have it we'd which is Justin and we have

736
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:02,139
a few other engineers that are actually

737
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:05,230
you know maybe seventy percent of time

738
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:06,880
focusing on taking manual steps and you

739
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:09,280
know into an automated process and and

740
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,140
then as we start doing the other against

741
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,730
thirty percent is manual we start

742
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:16,030
working that as a project okay how can

743
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:18,820
we automate this and then for a good

744
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:21,310
amount of time we were all to an extent

745
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:24,280
sharing the workload on automating a

746
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:26,830
certain process um but now we're

747
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:28,750
starting to sort of crystallized into

748
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:30,370
specialized roles and center one

749
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:31,750
person's focusing on this over here the

750
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,699
others there but in terms of the

751
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:35,380
operations side especially for these

752
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,760
processes that are generating alerts

753
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:38,200
that we need to respond to we're all

754
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:40,870
sort of sharing the responsibility

755
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:43,750
around that did that answer your

756
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:45,719
question are you doing up in your Python

757
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:49,380
I saw the Python

758
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:52,860
um most of its in Ruby some of its in

759
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:54,330
Python like we has we hire new like team

760
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:56,729
members we don't really care like what

761
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:58,050
language you're writing and as usually

762
00:30:56,730 --> 00:31:00,990
six the Python Ruby because that's

763
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:02,730
usually where our expertise lies but as

764
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:04,110
long as the service is working and like

765
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:06,420
you're able to support it and

766
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:07,770
documentation is relatively good it's

767
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:09,450
not really all that matters so I'm

768
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:11,250
really looking forward to refactoring

769
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:12,630
everything into Phil's yeah I here go is

770
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:18,980
pretty pretty popular so we're probably

771
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:18,980
rewrite everything so yeah

772
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:29,230
fishing lake tables yeah so there other

773
00:31:28,179 --> 00:31:31,840
zone

774
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:35,580
that you don't have as big as you guys

775
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,580
have expertise

776
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:44,790
to to commercialize it yeah yeah we just

777
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:47,940
work on the security team we don't yeah

778
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:59,970
we don't know our heads are down all day

779
00:31:47,940 --> 00:32:01,410
we have no idea what there's phantom

780
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:03,300
there's command what you'll see people

781
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:04,950
walking around a breacher I mean there's

782
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:07,260
a lot of like energy security

783
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:08,730
orchestration the products are coming on

784
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:10,590
the more I think you really have a way

785
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:12,150
whether the cost of those is worth the

786
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:14,899
first right except icon screw himself

787
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:14,900
yep

788
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:19,280
yeah can you recommend just like a good

789
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:21,168
starting point if you're looking for

790
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:25,070
something automated process where Jan

791
00:32:21,169 --> 00:32:27,830
first um for us the fishing analysis

792
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:30,289
workflow was a great starting point and

793
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:35,659
I'm pretty sure a lot of companies deal

794
00:32:30,289 --> 00:32:37,490
with that and I guess I'm biased but I

795
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,809
would recommend that it's it's

796
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:40,669
straightforward enough you know you can

797
00:32:38,809 --> 00:32:43,250
set up a mailbox that employees can send

798
00:32:40,669 --> 00:32:45,230
all that into and then you can start to

799
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:47,270
pull out those emails and test parsing

800
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:48,860
them and then move to the next step

801
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:51,740
integrate with some sort of link

802
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:53,240
analysis system file analysis system and

803
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:55,610
you just iterate on that slowly and then

804
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:57,020
all of a sudden it all ties together and

805
00:32:55,610 --> 00:33:00,260
they're like how did I find the time to

806
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:01,970
do all yeah we were fortunate for being

807
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:03,950
able to have the mail service that

808
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:05,539
supports API is so like that's where but

809
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:07,309
we saw that capability like oh well we

810
00:33:05,539 --> 00:33:09,379
can easily automate this and we also

811
00:33:07,309 --> 00:33:11,450
started like independently developing

812
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:12,830
services because a lot of times if you

813
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:14,090
want to look up a domain see if it's

814
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:16,490
malicious we will get a bunch of tabs

815
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:18,168
outside of the fishing use case so we

816
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:19,760
built some services to do that and then

817
00:33:18,169 --> 00:33:21,260
we start incorporating that into the

818
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,080
fishing workflow so that everything

819
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:27,590
seemed fine work seamlessly and on up I

820
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:29,480
I guess I had to answer that question

821
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:31,639
with my own bias just because they're

822
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,780
probably so many other processes out

823
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,159
there we haven't thought about

824
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:36,799
automating yet and that's kind of the

825
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,330
point of the talk sort of bring this

826
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:40,220
idea to the forefront of everyone's mind

827
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:42,049
so when you go to back to work next week

828
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:43,520
and you engage in that day-to-day

829
00:33:42,049 --> 00:33:45,320
process you've been doing for the past

830
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:47,418
few years you stop and think wait a

831
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:49,010
second I do this over and over again

832
00:33:47,419 --> 00:33:51,230
isn't there a system I could plug into

833
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:52,669
or tie two systems together just to get

834
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:56,320
this one step done and then think about

835
00:33:52,669 --> 00:33:56,320
the other steps in that process yeah

836
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:03,900
specifically regarding your fishing flow

837
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:06,000
do you see like how you have treat

838
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:08,100
handle incident response within a

839
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,780
success others correction of the UN

840
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:12,150
dismayed cultures and stuff like that a

841
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:16,790
lot of people play from Atlanta it's

842
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:21,120
actually executed malicious he may

843
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:22,710
consider as part of that yeah and we we

844
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:25,889
didn't have stages on there for that

845
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:28,650
just to keep it simple but you know you

846
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:31,679
can imagine that if you have some kind

847
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:35,610
of ids IPS tool or web proxy where you

848
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:36,870
can see okay I got this phishing email

849
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:38,280
from an employee it's definitely

850
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:40,109
malicious and there's a link in there

851
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:43,140
did anyone else visit that link you

852
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:44,940
correlate that across your proxy tools

853
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:46,469
what have you then you can narrow that

854
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:49,050
down to all the users that actually

855
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:50,969
visited the link you can see if anything

856
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:53,190
was actually returned it was is it a

857
00:34:50,969 --> 00:34:55,620
dead link was it just a 40 for something

858
00:34:53,190 --> 00:35:00,300
or knows the 200 and it looks like a

859
00:34:55,620 --> 00:35:02,490
file gets dropped if if you're brave

860
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:05,040
enough and you know like okay that

861
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:07,560
machine is screwed you can add that

862
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:10,290
quarantine step to the workflow if you

863
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:12,150
have a remote imaging system could add

864
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:13,380
that to the workflow say okay we're

865
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:14,850
going to quarantine the box we're going

866
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:16,620
to do a little more analysis to see what

867
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:17,970
happened and then once we're confident

868
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:21,359
that we can just blow this away and

869
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:23,700
reissue something let's remotely wipe it

870
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:25,790
a reimage it pick it up later give them

871
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:29,250
a loaner laptop or something like that

872
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:30,930
that's that's definitely something to

873
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:33,590
consider for that work for them to add

874
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:33,589
into it yeah

875
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,900
you
