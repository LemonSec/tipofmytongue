1
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:15,739
a little bit about my background I've

2
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:17,660
done about everything in security i

3
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:22,580
started i graduated out of the Media Lab

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:25,640
the MIT Media Lab focused on how humans

5
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:27,139
perceive technology I was doing some

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,059
crazy things with head-mounted displays

7
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,890
a friend of my friend and I actually

8
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:32,899
developed our own head mounted display

9
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:35,780
crazy enough it looked just like the

10
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:38,059
Apple glass or the google glass that

11
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,590
came out so I'm trying to figure out

12
00:00:38,059 --> 00:00:44,059
where my friend is who worked with me on

13
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:46,129
that but I I mean that was a small-time

14
00:00:44,059 --> 00:00:47,899
you know kind of kitty hacker at a c64

15
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:49,428
at home poor family so what else am I

16
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:51,440
going to do but do BBS hacking in my

17
00:00:49,429 --> 00:00:52,789
spare time I learned some basic did some

18
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,379
coding that sort of thing and then

19
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:56,480
decided yeah I suck at this so if I

20
00:00:54,379 --> 00:00:58,129
could figure something else to do and so

21
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,260
I went into cognitive psychology start

22
00:00:58,129 --> 00:01:03,170
focusing on how humans interact with

23
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:05,600
technology which made it great to become

24
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:08,120
a social engineer so that was fun and so

25
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,009
from there I did usability engineering

26
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,800
for the government doing user interface

27
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:14,510
design but then I moved into security

28
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,770
because I was already kind of doing

29
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,969
security so I figured I might as well

30
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:19,070
move into security I've been doing

31
00:01:16,969 --> 00:01:20,780
security for about 20 years started on

32
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:23,449
the consulting side I actually call

33
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:26,210
myself recovering consultant anybody a

34
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:30,340
consultant in the room anybody who wants

35
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:32,869
to be a consultant in the room they so

36
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:34,219
but i did some interesting things i work

37
00:01:32,869 --> 00:01:35,930
with some big companies work with some

38
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:39,860
big agency start working on really

39
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:41,810
really large risky security oriented

40
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:45,680
projects i'm sure everyone's heard about

41
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:47,240
DHS at one point in time DHS was a bunch

42
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,829
of different little bureaus that all

43
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,240
came together at a net by an act of

44
00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:52,250
congress and didn't want to communicate

45
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,140
with each other I was the guy who was

46
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:57,829
trying to convince all those CIA SOS to

47
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:59,750
do so so I did some of that and then I

48
00:01:57,829 --> 00:02:01,130
jumped out of consulting became a CISO

49
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:02,210
started listening to vendors try and

50
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:04,579
sell me twenty-thousand-dollar

51
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:06,619
appliances why do security appliances

52
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:10,788
always cost twenty thousand dollars I

53
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:12,140
don't get it to this day somehow that's

54
00:02:10,788 --> 00:02:14,179
the magic price point I guess somebody

55
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:18,440
paid twenty thousand dollars like oh I

56
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:19,940
got an idea so so I did that and then I

57
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,500
ran my own consider curity consulting

58
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:23,060
company with a friend of mine moved from

59
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,900
DC thank goodness i don't know if

60
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,000
anybody lives in DC ors ever lived in

61
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,819
DC I would never wish that on my worst

62
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,640
enemy came up here to Boston I started

63
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:34,920
focusing on advanced research and one of

64
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,809
the things about advanced research you

65
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,599
know we have a problem with security

66
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,489
right in all of those pads that you know

67
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,230
all the path that I've taken all the

68
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:45,150
little touch points I've taken as far as

69
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:50,899
security is concerned there's one thing

70
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:54,359
that has been consistent we users

71
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:56,970
administrators investors businesspeople

72
00:02:54,359 --> 00:02:59,609
executives etc etc board members we are

73
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:02,670
the weakest link right why have we been

74
00:02:59,609 --> 00:03:05,280
saying this for 20 some odd years at

75
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:07,379
least right I say 20 some odd years

76
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,629
because of course we didn't have really

77
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:11,459
the web before then so we didn't have a

78
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:13,560
lot of cause to have to talk a lot about

79
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:15,750
security but for the past 20 years we've

80
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,959
been talking about we are the weakest

81
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:20,489
like and the thing is is through my

82
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,540
entire career I've been trying to figure

83
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:27,420
out what does that mean not what does

84
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:29,668
the statement mean but what does it mean

85
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:32,160
that we keep saying the same thing over

86
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:34,470
and over and over for two decades at

87
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,000
least and so you started taking a look

88
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:37,650
at the problem of course cognitive

89
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,440
psychologist I always have to see okay

90
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,849
how am I things up right what am

91
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,379
I just doing wrong I'm doing something

92
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:44,760
wrong everyone's doing something wrong

93
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:46,620
I've been saying for years everyone's

94
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,260
doing something wrong and I started

95
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,329
thinking about it and I'm like there's a

96
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:53,220
different problem here if we if we keep

97
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:56,010
saying the same thing it's kind of the

98
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:58,859
definition of madness right we keep

99
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:00,418
expecting a different result and all

100
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:03,090
that's happened over the past 20 years

101
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:05,220
is there's more of us saying it right

102
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:08,489
but you start thinking about it and you

103
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:10,470
start realizing that what is going on is

104
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:14,430
we're trying to convince ourselves that

105
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:15,720
we know what the problem is but if we

106
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:18,840
can't haven't been able to solve the

107
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:21,060
problem then can we really say that and

108
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:22,679
so I started looking at the psychology

109
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,830
of it I came to bsides last year was my

110
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:29,639
first b-sides I really had a great time

111
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:30,659
and Melanie Anson last year she was she

112
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:32,220
was talking about how security

113
00:04:30,659 --> 00:04:35,969
professionals market themselves how they

114
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:38,520
market their capabilities and how they

115
00:04:35,969 --> 00:04:40,860
communicate to executives and all that

116
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,750
and she said consistently blaming people

117
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:45,000
reinforces the perception of being part

118
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:47,099
of a negative subculture and generates

119
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,690
hostility well we all know that because

120
00:04:47,099 --> 00:04:49,979
we're kind of a hostile community right

121
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:52,469
when in part we want to generate

122
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:54,659
hostility because we think that by

123
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:58,770
generating hostility we are going to

124
00:04:54,659 --> 00:05:00,930
affect change right but I'll go back to

125
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:02,789
we keep saying the same thing over and

126
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:04,050
over and you can extend that to just

127
00:05:02,789 --> 00:05:07,229
about everything else that the community

128
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:09,780
does vendors are saying the same things

129
00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:11,969
over and over they're selling the same

130
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:13,739
things over and over we put new names on

131
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:15,449
them we do some incremental enhancements

132
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,069
we add about five more pages of

133
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:21,449
configuration and say now you're good to

134
00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:23,699
go right so if we keep saying the same

135
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:25,830
thing over and over and we're developing

136
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:29,400
a negative subculture so we're being

137
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:31,770
less listen to less and less then what

138
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:34,440
does that actually mean about us as a

139
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:35,758
community now I piss people off by

140
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,319
talking about this in the way that I

141
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,819
talk about this i'm not saying it in

142
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:40,229
order to be adversarial even though as a

143
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:44,729
security professional i suppose it is

144
00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:47,090
part of my job right but i think that

145
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:51,030
we're living with the shared delusion of

146
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:55,169
superiority right it's a delusion that

147
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:57,479
is consistently reinforced right these

148
00:05:55,169 --> 00:05:58,830
headlines this is from this week because

149
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:00,690
of course i wrote the presentation this

150
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:06,810
week it didn't really have time to do it

151
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:08,250
otherwise and so um we every time we see

152
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:11,130
a data breach every time we see a hack

153
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:15,300
every time something happens that's bad

154
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:18,599
in security it reinforces our rightness

155
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:20,639
our correctness right we are basically

156
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:22,380
living high on the fact that all these

157
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,789
years everything that happens we are

158
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:31,770
right and this is proof that we're right

159
00:06:25,789 --> 00:06:33,810
hmm yeah America that's right so the

160
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:38,340
question at the bottom there if we're so

161
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:41,039
smart then why isn't anything getting

162
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:45,419
better I ask people all the time I ask

163
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:47,849
the people I work with I I work with a

164
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:50,008
lot of non security researchers right

165
00:06:47,849 --> 00:06:52,320
and I also work with I'm working with

166
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:54,630
the ciso of my organization right now

167
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,969
as he and I have good sit-downs me

168
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:59,880
having Tennessee is oh he being a CISO

169
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:02,670
for a nominally a defense contractor and

170
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:05,250
I sit down I say here are the ways that

171
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:06,510
I'm breaking your policy right now you

172
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,640
know I'm breaking your policy you know

173
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:10,170
my team's breaking the policy and I can

174
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,120
tell you all the good reasons why we're

175
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:13,560
breaking that policy the thing is is

176
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,060
that it's because something's not

177
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,800
working we're not being enabled we can't

178
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:20,940
do this but I understand that I try and

179
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:23,250
serve as a bridge right but if we're

180
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:26,790
always consistently right and why isn't

181
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:28,920
anything getting fixed so I want to

182
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:33,210
change things up a little bit and say at

183
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:34,460
some point we need to stop being so good

184
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:39,210
about pointing the finger around

185
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:41,310
everything that surrounds us and we need

186
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:43,590
to turn the finger back on ourselves as

187
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:46,290
a community if things aren't getting

188
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:47,880
better okay fine at some point we just

189
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:50,130
need to come to acceptance we're living

190
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:52,200
in the state of denial right now we are

191
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:59,310
the weakest link the security community

192
00:07:52,200 --> 00:08:01,830
has not fixed what we set out to fix so

193
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:04,140
then the question becomes okay after

194
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:06,419
half the room wants to lynch me or you

195
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:08,669
know then we go into typical security

196
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:11,480
mode cynicism I haven't seen anyone

197
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:14,700
leave yet so i guess i'm doing ok but

198
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:18,840
the obvious statement the next statement

199
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:22,650
that we too rarely move towards is what

200
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:25,950
do we do about it right what can we do

201
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:27,840
about it so what i would say from a

202
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:29,370
cycle from a psychology perspective i'm

203
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,520
going back to my social psychology

204
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:34,740
education where of course the professor

205
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,390
asked why are you in this class and the

206
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:38,039
best response came from a football

207
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:40,348
player and yes MIT does have football

208
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:41,640
players the best response came from a

209
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:43,320
football player who said I want to learn

210
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,880
how to manipulate people and the

211
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:48,300
professor says that's the best response

212
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,340
I've ever heard anyone give he also

213
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,750
wanted us to grade ourselves by the end

214
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,820
of the term and halfway into it he was

215
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:56,180
asking us he had to have an intervention

216
00:08:53,820 --> 00:09:00,600
because we were all giving ourselves ass

217
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:03,540
so I I presented this theory at is d

218
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,880
squared last year where I said that my

219
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:07,290
theory is that part of the

220
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,610
if we start going to start looking at

221
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:10,079
the root causes the problem we have to

222
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:11,820
take some introspection maybe a little

223
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:15,840
bit of intervention and we have to say

224
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:17,970
that where what is the root cause of our

225
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,590
problem and I would I what I'm

226
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:21,690
theorizing is that the root cause

227
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:24,060
happened at about the point where the

228
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:25,590
web was the web started getting used for

229
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,719
e-commerce right where we started

230
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:29,400
professionalizing the use of the

231
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,100
internet and we started to

232
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,630
professionalize ourselves as a community

233
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:35,070
right at one point in time hackers and

234
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:38,400
security professionals were the same

235
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:42,840
people in different contexts in fact

236
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:44,550
literally the same person right you're a

237
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:47,010
hacker by some point of the day you were

238
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:50,130
a protector at some point at night mit

239
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:52,020
at the in the 90s the way that the MIT

240
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:55,050
network was run the MIT network was run

241
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:58,020
by the hackers why because they were the

242
00:09:55,050 --> 00:10:00,000
ones trying to defend their space right

243
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:02,370
from the hackers that were trying to

244
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,830
take over that space it was a game you

245
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:06,960
know it was a game but we all had very

246
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:08,840
similar skills and we all shared

247
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:13,680
information we didn't have any sense of

248
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:14,520
malfeasance vs um what altruism or you

249
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,880
know whatever you want to call it

250
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:20,100
goodness we were the same people and in

251
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:22,320
a lot of ways we would make decisions

252
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,000
based on the context that gave us kind

253
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,500
of that gray hat sort of mentality right

254
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,270
depending on the context we might be a

255
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,260
black hat we might be a white hat it's

256
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:30,480
all a matter of what we're trying to

257
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,830
defend that then there was a divergence

258
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,970
the divergence happened with

259
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:35,850
professionalizing the use of the

260
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:38,370
internet okay so what happened is we

261
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:40,020
started becoming corporate beings we had

262
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:44,270
to start adhering to certain structures

263
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:49,020
we had to start you know we had to start

264
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:51,720
being consistent we had to have

265
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:54,480
stability in what we were doing we had

266
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,700
to get certifications I've had my cissp

267
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,070
forever I don't know why is just kind of

268
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:01,200
inertia at this point right I don't even

269
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:02,790
know what it means anymore to have it

270
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,710
other than the fact that every July I've

271
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:06,599
got it goes creeping back through all my

272
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:08,400
you know activities to get my CPEs

273
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,230
together thank you very much besides for

274
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:17,339
letting me speak I think I've got my cps

275
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:19,250
for this year um hmm hey yeah so so we

276
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:21,380
had this divergence but

277
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:24,530
the whole puzzle thing up there we I

278
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:28,010
feel like by professionalizing we've

279
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:29,530
lost our ability to solve the puzzles we

280
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:31,819
used to solve we used to get really

281
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:34,069
fascinated by the puzzles by just trying

282
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:36,080
to tool around and figure out how things

283
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:38,270
worked and and we didn't figure out

284
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,830
things broke to find out how they broke

285
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:41,780
we were do we were breaking things

286
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:44,600
trying to figure out how it worked right

287
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:46,280
and it was there there was there was

288
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:49,250
that exploration of it but what happened

289
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:51,650
is that the security practitioner became

290
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:55,700
way too formal and way to practice in

291
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:58,550
routine but the hacker did not and so

292
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:00,620
there was a divergence and we started

293
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:03,620
losing cycles we started losing the

294
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:05,510
ability to to dedicate time to invest

295
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:12,590
time and resources and doing that stuff

296
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:14,000
so if you accept that and I won't ask if

297
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:15,830
anybody accepts that because I like to

298
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:21,620
live in my own delusion superiority uh

299
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:23,540
what about security is so hard right and

300
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:26,750
I asked that question intentionally

301
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:28,339
because 1i I like my hacker graphic of

302
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:31,790
being hit over the head with a hammer

303
00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:35,060
but I asked the question because I feel

304
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:37,130
like we're asking the wrong questions

305
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:38,839
we're trying to solve the wrong problems

306
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:40,490
and I think that all the breaches

307
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:42,680
telling us that we're right that there

308
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:43,790
are problems it's kind of masking the

309
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,979
fact that we're not willing to actually

310
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:50,270
explore what those root cause problems

311
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:52,490
are right and so I feel like in all the

312
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:54,079
steps in my career I I kept thinking

313
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:55,490
there's got to be a better way I'm gonna

314
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,020
go try something different I'm going to

315
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:59,180
go become an executive and see how

316
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:00,860
operations can be fixed okay well that

317
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:02,569
didn't work out too well let me let me

318
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,460
go run a consulting company because I

319
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:05,690
think I I'm better well you know that

320
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,520
didn't work very well actually that

321
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:08,960
works great my wife relocated us here

322
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,180
and I gave it to my partner because I

323
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:13,550
wasn't willing to travel at him down to

324
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:16,370
DC well maybe Advanced Research had the

325
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:19,069
answer but then what are some of the

326
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:20,450
things that people say about researchers

327
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,440
and when I say Advanced Research i'm

328
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:23,960
talking about i'm going to be talking

329
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,250
about DARPA programs right I'm going to

330
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,480
sound a lot like Mudge actually in fact

331
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:28,280
you'll see a couple of graphics that

332
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,170
look just like Mudge's graphics except

333
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:35,750
they're better here

334
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:38,779
but you from from there's gotta be a way

335
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:40,940
all of our intelligence all of our

336
00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:44,089
smartness and our innate abilities to

337
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:46,850
solve puzzles we should be able to do a

338
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:48,320
better job so how do we do that what

339
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:50,690
about it is so hard let's look at that

340
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,980
problem so I know a lot of people have

341
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:59,120
seen this t-shirt walking around the

342
00:13:51,980 --> 00:14:00,740
cons um majority said this he was about

343
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,149
as critical of antivirus as I am about

344
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,430
the entire security industry as a whole

345
00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:05,720
security industry is a subscribe and

346
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:07,819
respond model it's not even about

347
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:12,290
security what we would consider security

348
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:14,810
right security companies they come up

349
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:18,199
and I can say this because they did this

350
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:21,138
to me come up and they say i want you to

351
00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:22,399
subscribe to my service okay i want you

352
00:14:21,139 --> 00:14:24,860
to subscribe to my service because it's

353
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,990
fantastic everything you're doing well

354
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:30,230
you got to keep doing it but i want you

355
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:32,360
to do more you've got capex right you've

356
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:34,220
got a capital expenditure moaning well I

357
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:38,390
want you to use it on us because you've

358
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:40,459
got to use it somewhere and then when

359
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:42,939
something breaks I want you to call us

360
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:46,250
again so we can tell you what broke and

361
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:47,240
then when we tell you what broke I want

362
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:49,699
you to call us again because then we'll

363
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:52,640
tell you how to fix it oh you still have

364
00:14:49,699 --> 00:14:54,620
capex right what ended up happening from

365
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:57,230
a CISO perspective is my capex Dave

366
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:58,339
level year after year my effects was

367
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,810
going through the roof because I was

368
00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:04,640
kept sliding more and more appliances

369
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:09,589
into my racks right but so essentially

370
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:11,420
the question becomes why do most of us

371
00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:12,620
think this is actually correct there's a

372
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:14,120
point in time where the only way you

373
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,760
learn about data breaches was because

374
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,680
brian krebs figured it out going through

375
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,660
credit records and you know dark web

376
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:23,209
forum selling credit cards and you know

377
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:25,130
all the connections that he has all

378
00:15:23,209 --> 00:15:29,899
these organizations you know they had

379
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:32,360
the tools right they all had tools and

380
00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:35,630
what do we say when target gets hacked

381
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:37,390
her when Sony gets hacked or whatever we

382
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:39,199
say oh they just weren't using the ring

383
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:41,209
target what was the one the first

384
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,410
headlines I saw oh they had something

385
00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:43,319
that could have found the breach but

386
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:44,939
they weren't using it

387
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,550
it hasn't been actually you know

388
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:49,620
deployed yet and we keep finding reasons

389
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:53,189
but if they have the tools what good are

390
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:57,240
they right the basic premise I'm trying

391
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:58,980
to get to is an understanding that okay

392
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,450
we're selling lots of tools we're using

393
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,560
lots of tools we're consulting we're

394
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:04,800
integrating we're doing all this stuff

395
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:07,560
but they're not working our first

396
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:10,579
instinct is to blame the administrators

397
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:14,160
to blame the users to blame how it was

398
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:16,590
configured how it's being logged but

399
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,439
that's that's going past the point right

400
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:24,350
what we're doing is we're really

401
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:28,880
defeating our core mission and that's to

402
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:31,320
protect what's good protect the users

403
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:34,740
right how do we protect them if we keep

404
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:37,320
blaming them so as I delve into this a

405
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:41,220
little more I kind of came to this idea

406
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:44,310
that we we sort of i'm sure people could

407
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:45,630
add to this list but i kind of started

408
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:46,859
thinking about it from a software

409
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,480
perspective we keep selling tools

410
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,980
generally it's software there there's

411
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,330
not a lot of hardware and I'll time I

412
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:53,010
talk about a little bit of that but I

413
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:55,440
kind of cut it down to three assumptions

414
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:58,560
right these three assumptions we can

415
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,760
write secure code right you think about

416
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,550
the things that we blame people for

417
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:04,410
right we can write secure code we can

418
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:07,619
simplify the administration of software

419
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:10,110
or is it simplify the development and

420
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:14,579
administration of software we can manage

421
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:17,310
patches right all of the messages I hear

422
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:20,220
that blame someone kind of go in some

423
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:23,579
spectrum of these assumptions right so

424
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:25,410
if we're blaming them based on these

425
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:27,990
assumptions then these assumptions must

426
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:30,000
be correct right well if we take a look

427
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:31,170
at each of the assumptions maybe maybe

428
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,050
we can get a better understanding of

429
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:37,410
that root cause problem um we can write

430
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:39,450
secure code Microsoft are wonderful

431
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:41,040
hosts here hopefully I don't piss

432
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:42,990
anybody off from Microsoft if I do I'm

433
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:47,280
sorry I doubt you want to hire me anyway

434
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:49,620
um Microsoft is great case study right

435
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:52,230
the trusted computing initiative great

436
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:55,229
idea great necessary idea it was a

437
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:56,830
marketing ploy it lasted for 10 years 12

438
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:59,740
years something like that

439
00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:02,590
and of course Microsoft will come back

440
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:04,929
and say well it's still going on all we

441
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:07,209
did is redistribute those people into

442
00:18:04,929 --> 00:18:09,159
the places where they need to go living

443
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:10,450
one of the mantras that we use which is

444
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:14,140
the security people need to be

445
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:15,850
integrated into the teens right except

446
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,289
what Microsoft doesn't tell you is most

447
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:18,459
the people who were part of the trusted

448
00:18:17,289 --> 00:18:20,470
computing initiative are no longer with

449
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:24,909
Microsoft so if that was such a good

450
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:28,299
idea why right well we still have

451
00:18:24,909 --> 00:18:29,529
patched Tuesday right in fact in trusted

452
00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:31,090
computing initiative I think probably

453
00:18:29,529 --> 00:18:32,500
started Patch Tuesday because otherwise

454
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:33,730
it was just randomly we're just getting

455
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:36,370
patches and so in order to help

456
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:38,139
organizations we we gave them okay

457
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:40,389
here's what we're going to do just to

458
00:18:38,139 --> 00:18:42,668
make CISO your life easier we're going

459
00:18:40,389 --> 00:18:44,158
to tell you which day of every single

460
00:18:42,669 --> 00:18:46,450
week you need to have your people

461
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:48,460
working overtime so they can evaluate

462
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:50,830
whether or not something's going to

463
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:52,929
break in your environment right then you

464
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:55,629
can plan around it that's great love it

465
00:18:52,929 --> 00:18:57,610
but the core thing is is that what

466
00:18:55,630 --> 00:19:03,279
Microsoft was experimenting with and was

467
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:06,428
doing quite a let's call it a beneficial

468
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:08,350
effort was Microsoft really put a lot

469
00:19:06,429 --> 00:19:10,870
behind and I mean Bill Gates had a great

470
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:13,269
statement about it I have a lot of

471
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:18,928
respect for everything that mr. gates is

472
00:19:13,269 --> 00:19:22,389
done and I think this is right in a way

473
00:19:18,929 --> 00:19:25,149
but yet here we are this was what 2002

474
00:19:22,389 --> 00:19:27,549
here we are 14 years later and we're

475
00:19:25,149 --> 00:19:29,260
still getting patches every week right

476
00:19:27,549 --> 00:19:31,418
the only thing that's changed is that

477
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:33,669
they're shrinking the lifespan of the

478
00:19:31,419 --> 00:19:38,919
operating systems so they don't need to

479
00:19:33,669 --> 00:19:41,080
keep releasing patches for them right my

480
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:44,620
iPad just went in lock I think Apple

481
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:48,639
needs to fix that assumption too we can

482
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:52,439
we can simplify software right this is

483
00:19:48,639 --> 00:19:55,539
going to look really familiar okay

484
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:58,179
software size continues to grow right

485
00:19:55,539 --> 00:19:59,889
anybody else see this recently you know

486
00:19:58,179 --> 00:20:04,169
why this chart is better than Mudge's

487
00:19:59,889 --> 00:20:07,510
well I'll tell you um I'll tell you

488
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:10,600
Mudge is one of my jizz bosses who

489
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:12,309
reported to Regina Dugan at DARPA

490
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,600
and at Google a tap was a gentleman by

491
00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:16,210
the name of Ken Gabriel who's now my

492
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,590
boss he hates this chart too just as

493
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:19,840
much as general Alexander I best hate

494
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:24,220
that hates it and so when I showed him

495
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:27,159
this chart he said I hate this chart and

496
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:31,059
what I did I took out the years and the

497
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:36,520
lines of code now it's gorgeous now no

498
00:20:31,059 --> 00:20:38,678
one can argue with me about numbers but

499
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:41,020
up there we have I changed I've changed

500
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:43,270
some of the the code bases a little much

501
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:46,379
talked about operating systems i added

502
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:49,120
in i think that's a c-class Mercedes

503
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:51,460
Mercedes Mercedes is great at creating

504
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,959
bloatware I'll tell you what you should

505
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:57,940
see the number of processors on that

506
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:59,620
thing it's awesome so anyway the budget

507
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:01,360
I have some disagreement as far as the

508
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:03,428
number of bugs per thousand lines of

509
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,799
code i'm pretty sure it's 15 i think

510
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:08,770
that 125 is a number of security defects

511
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:10,389
in thousand lines of code but i don't

512
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:11,980
think we need to argue about that about

513
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:14,320
numbers i'm actually going to take out

514
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:16,120
those numbers after you know much

515
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,559
disagrees because i know you know Mudge

516
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:23,020
has all the credibility I'll just some

517
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:27,730
dope up here so I've gotten like a

518
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:29,408
little gallery over here so um so when

519
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:31,240
you take a look at this and you think we

520
00:21:29,409 --> 00:21:33,010
can simplify software this doesn't even

521
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:35,409
tell the whole story right think about

522
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:37,240
the number of packages that we're

523
00:21:35,409 --> 00:21:39,240
reusing as we're building software think

524
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:43,179
about the number of open source packages

525
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:46,120
I was just looking at one very commonly

526
00:21:43,179 --> 00:21:47,590
used open source package and it has

527
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:51,459
somewhere on the order of a hundred

528
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:53,918
different other packages calling within

529
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:56,140
them now if you if you've ever been

530
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,549
exposed to open sort of it to software

531
00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:00,370
in general or anything like that you

532
00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:02,110
understand that a package the software

533
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:04,000
package may have a lot of functions in

534
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:05,830
it right and you need to you need to

535
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,299
basically use that package in order to

536
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:08,949
call that one function you want and

537
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:10,299
suddenly you've you know inherited

538
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:14,799
hundreds of functions you're never going

539
00:22:10,299 --> 00:22:17,770
to use right and then we're nesting so

540
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:20,230
much into that software that any given

541
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:22,450
developer actually does not cannot touch

542
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:23,980
every part of the saw of the software

543
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:25,360
that you're actually delivering

544
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:27,840
then when there's a paps that comes out

545
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,820
no one knows where who's affected by it

546
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:33,040
right G would see that's a good one

547
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:35,290
let's have a vulnerability in G let's

548
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:39,190
see and see how many people you know can

549
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:40,418
fix that right away um and so we're

550
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:42,400
talking about all the nesting and

551
00:22:40,419 --> 00:22:46,240
everything that happens and we start to

552
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:48,880
understand that can we really simplify

553
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,290
code I mean someone l word some people

554
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,370
say that the answer is going to be IOT

555
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:56,799
because we're gonna have smaller code

556
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:58,299
bases I laughs of course majority showed

557
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,530
that malware is not going up anywhere

558
00:22:58,299 --> 00:23:03,340
because we only have to attack one

559
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:05,470
little you know small park right so I

560
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:08,620
think that assumption it can be blown

561
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:10,929
away so third assumption let's talk

562
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:12,639
about managing patches who thinks we can

563
00:23:10,929 --> 00:23:14,799
manage a patch man and we can do patch

564
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:18,220
management oh they just didn't deploy

565
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:19,540
the patch yeah how many times have you

566
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:21,070
heard people say that how many times

567
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:26,020
have you said that how many times have I

568
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:28,120
said that we are terrible Apache for

569
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:29,710
good and bad reasons right okay the

570
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,719
administrator I can't patch that

571
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:34,030
database because it might break it well

572
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:36,429
yeah I I remember Oracle deployed a

573
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:38,260
patch one time this was back in the 90s

574
00:23:36,429 --> 00:23:40,540
Oracle developed a patch for a

575
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:43,419
vulnerability it was it was some sort of

576
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:45,159
you know remote oh we've got an open

577
00:23:43,419 --> 00:23:46,990
back door vulnerability we're gonna

578
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:50,429
close it by not closing vulnerability

579
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:54,850
but by removing the function that had it

580
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:57,610
thanks Oracle I appreciate Larry um but

581
00:23:54,850 --> 00:24:00,459
there are good reasons there are bad

582
00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:05,168
reasons there are many reasons there are

583
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:07,059
people reasons right but please don't

584
00:24:05,169 --> 00:24:08,710
argue with me about the verizon dvir i

585
00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:11,020
intentionally did not fix this to be the

586
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:13,510
2015 because it seems like nobody likes

587
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:15,280
the 2015 I don't really like the 2015

588
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:18,250
either so get past the fact that this

589
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:22,090
comes from verizon let's just focus on a

590
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:23,980
little bit about the information in 2014

591
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:24,909
verizon found its investigations at

592
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,559
seventy-five percent of the

593
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:30,160
vulnerabilities that were exploited in

594
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:34,270
2014 came from before 2014 in fact came

595
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:35,890
from 2011 back I love 1999 I think

596
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:37,040
verizon they get real kick when they put

597
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:42,650
that 1999 and

598
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:44,930
you know what that is that's SNMP it's

599
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:47,660
it's it's still a problem right it's

600
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:49,490
still problem but so 75% older than

601
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:51,320
three years right five percent were

602
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:56,180
discovered in 2004 to where at least

603
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:58,790
discos in 2014 right so there's reasons

604
00:24:56,180 --> 00:25:00,500
for this we know that okay now we're

605
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:03,110
looking at going oh my gosh things are

606
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:05,990
really bad we can't do anything right

607
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:08,510
well I think that kind of blows

608
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:11,480
assumption 3 out of the way right is

609
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:12,890
this right we could argue over whether

610
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:15,530
or not this is right but i think it

611
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:19,610
probably is a pretty good point right is

612
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:21,110
the assumption valid well i think based

613
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:22,760
on what I've heard from blame messages

614
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:29,379
it's a valid assumption that we're

615
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:32,030
making but is it correct can we fix that

616
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:35,060
there's a harder problem to evaluate

617
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:40,910
here and it gets worse let's talk about

618
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:43,610
IOT again what was it nest or Google had

619
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:45,350
bought that a hub and they said that I

620
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:46,459
OT hub that everyone said it was going

621
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:47,870
to be the next big thing and then they

622
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,860
killed it and said what we're going to

623
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:50,300
do is we're just going to remove the

624
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:51,790
capability all together so that we're

625
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,980
not leaving it unmanaged out there I

626
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:56,060
actually said that was a good idea

627
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:59,690
because that's not what's going to

628
00:25:56,060 --> 00:26:02,600
happen right right now we're getting

629
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:05,750
patches right right now it's just a

630
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:07,879
process problem right a really big one

631
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:09,470
but what about when we stop getting

632
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:12,290
patches whose responsibility is it going

633
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:15,050
to be to maintain those devices that are

634
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:16,879
on that are in the IOT that are no

635
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:23,000
longer being managed by companies that

636
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:25,490
no longer exists who twenty thousand

637
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,240
dollars in appliances that's right so

638
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:30,920
that is my premise the hypothesis

639
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:35,290
software will always be inherently

640
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:37,460
flawed why do we try to fix that then

641
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:39,020
you know we're going to be we're going

642
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:40,970
to be trying to write secure code and

643
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:43,340
what's going to happen is that all the

644
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:45,440
Sun we read the best code and we need to

645
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:47,899
write a new function as some kid 22

646
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,820
years old is going to come in some guy

647
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:51,030
who's 60 is finally going to retire that

648
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:52,500
22 year old is going

649
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:58,350
make a mistake that 60 year old maid

650
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:59,340
when he was 40 right oh but universities

651
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:04,949
they're the problem they're not teaching

652
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:06,270
them right I mean it Microsoft oh I'll

653
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:09,990
pick on our host a little bit i pick on

654
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:11,790
our hosts a lot um microsoft did a great

655
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:15,570
thing most brilliant thing they could do

656
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:17,940
in the 90s and that was to say hey we

657
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:20,790
know our software kind of doesn't always

658
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:23,430
work right but it's not our

659
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:27,030
responsibility to protect it it's yours

660
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:30,030
I want you to invest all of your

661
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:31,649
company's money and your employees time

662
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:34,860
I want you to create a whole industry a

663
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:38,180
professional industry around protecting

664
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:42,000
our software I call it defect acceptance

665
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:43,740
right brilliant business strategy you

666
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,850
can argue whether or not it's merited

667
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:49,260
but um it really is we've we've become

668
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:50,699
accustomed to that idea that it's hard

669
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:53,160
jobs to protect something that's already

670
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:55,500
defective right but all we can do is

671
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:57,600
just kind of put containers and wrappers

672
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:00,480
around it but again I ask what's the

673
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,740
core problem right we don't want to ask

674
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,930
that because now we're starting to get

675
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:05,640
hard right our imaginations are starting

676
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:08,580
to run wild about what the problem is

677
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:10,710
and so what what I'm trying to charge

678
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:12,449
everyone to do is number one stop the

679
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:14,400
blame it's not effective it obviously

680
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:17,610
hasn't worked you know you could just as

681
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:20,280
easily say stop the madness let's start

682
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:23,490
focusing on what the users need to

683
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:25,379
perform well not where they fail right

684
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:28,620
let's reassess the problems that we're

685
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:31,740
trying to solve and let's an embrace our

686
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:32,820
inner hackers again what we're dealing

687
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:35,220
with is we're dealing with a really

688
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:38,639
complex puzzle and it's a puzzle I think

689
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:42,210
most of us have willingly stopped trying

690
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:44,790
to piece together not saying it's going

691
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:47,190
to be easy but I'm saying that we need

692
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:49,590
we's can start forging new paths and

693
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:52,500
stop whining about the problems we can

694
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:54,270
be part of the solutions so the question

695
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:56,490
becomes what are we going to do about it

696
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:58,379
well I put this up here because I I

697
00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:00,060
really if you haven't noticed I'm trying

698
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:01,050
to charge I'm trying to charge up the

699
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:04,418
community I'm trying to change the

700
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:07,509
narrative CIO phone s from

701
00:29:04,419 --> 00:29:09,789
DHS he said this in 2016 it's online you

702
00:29:07,509 --> 00:29:12,279
can you know it's it's video it's really

703
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:13,779
great he says there there's no there's a

704
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:15,340
lot of incremental improvements in cyber

705
00:29:13,779 --> 00:29:18,039
security but there's really no

706
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:20,230
breakthroughs going on I'm like oh my

707
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:23,499
gosh here's a Vinick biggest cynic I've

708
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:27,999
heard in a while right the thing is is

709
00:29:23,499 --> 00:29:30,639
he's wrong but there's a problem there's

710
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:32,049
a problem they are happening i'm going

711
00:29:30,639 --> 00:29:34,119
to talk about three technologies that

712
00:29:32,049 --> 00:29:35,408
are going on in boston right now that

713
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:39,639
are being developed in boston right now

714
00:29:35,409 --> 00:29:41,499
the problem is is it's well one nobody

715
00:29:39,639 --> 00:29:43,029
speaks research or talk you know

716
00:29:41,499 --> 00:29:45,039
researchers can't talk to the

717
00:29:43,029 --> 00:29:46,989
practitioners because researchers have

718
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:49,029
this idealistic vision practitioners

719
00:29:46,989 --> 00:29:50,859
want you know too much blah blah blah

720
00:29:49,029 --> 00:29:52,539
blah blah it's hard to talk to the

721
00:29:50,859 --> 00:29:56,019
researchers I know I'm do it all every

722
00:29:52,539 --> 00:29:58,210
day but the challenges is that they

723
00:29:56,019 --> 00:30:00,309
don't necessarily have the access the

724
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:02,379
tool or the tools or the relationships

725
00:30:00,309 --> 00:30:07,869
to figure out what about what they're

726
00:30:02,379 --> 00:30:10,779
doing will work well right that's where

727
00:30:07,869 --> 00:30:12,668
we as a community can help we can help

728
00:30:10,779 --> 00:30:14,139
the researchers researchers but it's

729
00:30:12,669 --> 00:30:16,350
going to take a little bit of effort let

730
00:30:14,139 --> 00:30:20,019
me talk about some of the technologies

731
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:22,209
appropriate disclaimers I'm I related to

732
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:23,769
this effort one of the things much was

733
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:26,169
talking about is the stuff that DARPA

734
00:30:23,769 --> 00:30:28,330
funded when Mudge was at DARPA there was

735
00:30:26,169 --> 00:30:29,980
one of those big money programs 100

736
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:33,279
million dollar program that was focused

737
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:36,730
on the idea what if we could redo

738
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:39,700
computer architecture right and so that

739
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:41,950
effort was um was based on the premise

740
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:43,809
that computer architecture we use today

741
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:48,489
is the exact same computer architecture

742
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:50,379
that van Noy Minh designed in 1948 1947

743
00:30:48,489 --> 00:30:51,909
1948 the same architecture we just made

744
00:30:50,379 --> 00:30:53,709
it bigger faster gave it more memory

745
00:30:51,909 --> 00:30:55,539
connected to network and said go and

746
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:57,340
that architecture is essentially when a

747
00:30:55,539 --> 00:31:00,759
processor sees something comes in it

748
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:03,428
goes okay and so what um what the

749
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:06,789
project was it was part of the crash

750
00:31:03,429 --> 00:31:10,119
program which has some long acronym name

751
00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:11,830
that DARPA likes to use and bae systems

752
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:14,769
which I was at I wasn't involved in this

753
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:18,070
research project but bae systems said

754
00:31:14,769 --> 00:31:19,870
they had a project around building

755
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:21,790
your processor now there are problems

756
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:22,870
with transitioning a secure processor

757
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:25,090
right now you're telling everyone

758
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:27,250
they've got to use a new processor well

759
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:28,570
at the end of the project the team the

760
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:30,880
engineering team was able to demonstrate

761
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:32,320
that they could get most of the same

762
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,140
properties that they were building into

763
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:39,070
a proprietary processor onto a commodity

764
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:41,710
processor and so we call it Dover Draper

765
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:43,600
took over the transition of it Draper's

766
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:47,350
and not-for-profit research laboratory

767
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:49,060
and the reason why I came was you know

768
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:51,310
to do this but the reason why I went

769
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:54,940
over to Draper's because its board

770
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:56,500
driven mission oriented and they said we

771
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:58,270
are going to invest money we have in the

772
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:01,330
bank to see if we can transition that

773
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:03,550
that's one of the gap areas DARPA's

774
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:06,159
going to fund a project from eighty

775
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:08,500
percent risk say to about maybe let's

776
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:10,060
say sixty or fifty percent risk a VC is

777
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,800
only going to fund something at sub

778
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:13,600
twenty percent risk so where's the

779
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,860
thirty percent going to come from that's

780
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,629
what Draper is trying to do they're

781
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:18,040
giving us the opportunity to do that we

782
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:20,320
may crash and burn but one of the things

783
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:23,050
that's really cool is we we stopped

784
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:25,120
heartbleed we demonstrated that to our

785
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:27,580
CEO in February we stopped heartbleed on

786
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:30,729
the working we're working on an FPGA

787
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:33,340
right now so bare metal FPGA so we

788
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:35,140
showed heartbleed working gave it gave

789
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:38,709
his password actually so we know ken

790
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:41,680
Gabriel's password but then um what we

791
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:44,200
did is we we put it on our adapted

792
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:46,660
processor and it stopped it the cool

793
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,370
thing about is it's on a risk five risk

794
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:49,660
five if anybody's not familiar with risk

795
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:51,219
five risk five is an open source

796
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:53,350
instruction set architecture being

797
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:54,760
developed out of it's essentially out of

798
00:32:53,350 --> 00:33:00,429
Berkeley it's backed by Google's backed

799
00:32:54,760 --> 00:33:03,760
by Oracle it's backed by amazon and

800
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:05,730
several others the point here isn't to

801
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:08,350
tout our own technology it's too

802
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:11,440
it'sit's to talk about this is really

803
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:13,300
cool if we succeed this is awesome right

804
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,710
nobody uses risk five today but the

805
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:17,919
thing is is it's open you know how much

806
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:21,550
arm costs arm cost a million dollars a

807
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:24,820
year to use for companies to use 20

808
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:26,050
million dollars to design to the what we

809
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:28,870
would need to do is we would need to be

810
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:30,909
doing 20 million dollars to do what we

811
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:31,779
feel needs to be done at the processor

812
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:33,639
level

813
00:33:31,779 --> 00:33:36,489
or a year to do it on arm we started

814
00:33:33,639 --> 00:33:40,029
with risk 5 because that's free you know

815
00:33:36,489 --> 00:33:42,669
it's open source but it's an example

816
00:33:40,029 --> 00:33:44,679
it's an example and we we're forming a

817
00:33:42,669 --> 00:33:46,570
not-for-profit collaboration with

818
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:48,879
industry partners right now to get

819
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:50,799
access to it to see how is it how could

820
00:33:48,879 --> 00:33:53,349
it work in your environment and we're

821
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:57,129
going to open source all of the tools

822
00:33:53,349 --> 00:34:00,129
that are necessary to do it so great

823
00:33:57,129 --> 00:34:04,330
example i have a link up here oh yeah

824
00:34:00,129 --> 00:34:06,369
credits randall Munroe XKCD rocks that

825
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:08,679
link on the slides I'll make the slides

826
00:34:06,369 --> 00:34:11,558
available somehow you can always email

827
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:14,079
me to that link will take you to the

828
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:15,730
core paper one of the court papers that

829
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:18,929
describe the technology from the

830
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:21,849
research perspective another technology

831
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:24,730
not affiliated with as well I kind of

832
00:34:21,849 --> 00:34:26,710
one of the projects I manage MIT is a

833
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:29,139
team member for DARPA they're doing a

834
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:30,849
competing project on the same so I'm not

835
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:32,109
talking about my project i'm talking

836
00:34:30,849 --> 00:34:34,659
about mi tease project because it's

837
00:34:32,109 --> 00:34:37,719
really cool and i'm an MIT grad so i try

838
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:40,210
and pump them up a little bit um the

839
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:42,009
idea profit is auto correcting code as

840
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:45,639
your as you're working on it how cool

841
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:46,899
would that be they're not quite to auto

842
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:49,270
correcting right now but they are

843
00:34:46,899 --> 00:34:50,980
stewing synthesis for a specific code

844
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:52,449
class but they've got about two and a

845
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:53,980
half more years of work to do on the

846
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:55,629
project but this is really great

847
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:59,770
technology it's the idea that they can

848
00:34:55,629 --> 00:35:03,368
press office said recently that they can

849
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:05,950
repair ten times as fast as other as

850
00:35:03,369 --> 00:35:08,410
other techniques they also do different

851
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:10,629
things than other techniques do but this

852
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:13,089
is being done right where are we where

853
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:15,430
it's right there hey you know at the at

854
00:35:13,089 --> 00:35:16,900
the strange Frank gehry-designed status

855
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:20,259
Center over there that's where this work

856
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:24,640
is going on they would love they would

857
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:26,799
love to get real problems from

858
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:29,410
practitioners that they can focus some

859
00:35:26,799 --> 00:35:31,480
attention on in solving right you can

860
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:34,529
just contact the researchers I put a

861
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:36,640
link to the place where they talk about

862
00:35:34,529 --> 00:35:38,710
profit for your information there's a

863
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:42,980
paper they're also all the contacts are

864
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:45,410
there and then let me talk about ibr

865
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:48,920
I came from bae systems when I came over

866
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:51,680
to Draper a Draper driver um and I've

867
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:54,260
used ibr I've designed technologies on

868
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:56,060
top of I BR disclaimers there I think

869
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:57,590
it's really really cool and it's open

870
00:35:56,060 --> 00:36:00,440
source so it's available right now

871
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:02,510
online and what I dr what's really cool

872
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:04,760
about ib our introduction based routing

873
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:06,680
it's based on this concept that two

874
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:09,530
endpoints cannot communicate and less

875
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:11,750
introduced by a third party by a by by

876
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:13,790
some communal third party that third

877
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:15,650
party can then be connected to other

878
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:18,859
third parties in order to create a link

879
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:21,109
chain of introduction then if one of the

880
00:36:18,859 --> 00:36:22,130
endpoints detects something wrong with

881
00:36:21,109 --> 00:36:26,359
something going on with the other

882
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:27,830
endpoint the reputation is funneled

883
00:36:26,359 --> 00:36:30,200
through all the introducers and

884
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:32,299
eventually if your reputation drops to

885
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:36,140
some level then you would take action on

886
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:38,840
that it was it's it's a very simple

887
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:40,640
technology it uses point-to-point VPNs

888
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:42,050
once the introduction chain goes through

889
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,509
then what happens is it creates a

890
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:46,820
point-to-point tunnel between the two

891
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:48,560
endpoints that tunnel is refreshed in

892
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:50,450
some arbitrary time frame we were

893
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:53,180
generally doing three minutes there was

894
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:55,009
we demonstrated how it had no effect on

895
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:57,259
a video stream for example between two

896
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:59,150
endpoints as it was refreshing that

897
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:01,460
session and what it does at that session

898
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:03,380
refresh it is it asks everyone in the

899
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:04,670
chain have you heard anything bad have

900
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:07,609
you heard anything bad have you heard

901
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:10,280
anything back really really simple

902
00:37:07,609 --> 00:37:11,630
concept the researcher who first came up

903
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,220
with the idea gentleman by the name of

904
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:15,980
Gregg Fraser he runs his own company

905
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:19,250
down in Virginia he called it a

906
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:21,500
peer-to-peer network for devices but we

907
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:23,450
had done it bae the technology we

908
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:25,520
actually ended up building a management

909
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:28,368
layer around it for cyber physical

910
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:30,109
systems and after i left bae they

911
00:37:28,369 --> 00:37:33,619
continued with it and it seems to have

912
00:37:30,109 --> 00:37:35,900
some some movement in DoD so we'll we'll

913
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:37,220
see how the technology evolves but like

914
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:40,730
i said it's open source you can play

915
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:42,470
around with it now right and um there's

916
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:45,560
a pay i put a link to up there for the

917
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:48,350
core introductory paper again one of the

918
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:50,750
things i was impressed by josh Gorman

919
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:52,640
said at a recent conference last year he

920
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:54,680
said at a presentation where somebody

921
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,150
was talking about active research going

922
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,779
on technology research he said there

923
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:59,120
isn't enough

924
00:37:56,780 --> 00:38:00,860
this going on in security cons so that's

925
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:02,450
why I'm putting the paper sources this

926
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:04,070
is stuff you can actually get access to

927
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:05,629
you can look at you can find the

928
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:12,290
contacts you can talk to people about

929
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:14,780
them okay so no breakthroughs going on

930
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:16,610
each of these technologies solves

931
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:19,370
lower-level problems than we've been

932
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:22,160
willing to address up to this point are

933
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:25,400
they the solutions for those problems

934
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,930
well time's going to tell but to say

935
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,580
that it's not happening that there

936
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:34,250
aren't people exploring this space is

937
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:38,440
just flat-out wrong my tagline solutions

938
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:41,000
not problems we've blamed people enough

939
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:42,730
but our jobs are to protect the users

940
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:47,770
may be to protect them from themselves

941
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:50,420
right but the thing is is that there are

942
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:54,350
inherent flaws and everything that we

943
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:56,510
use today and we have been unwilling to

944
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:58,430
address those flaws thinking that either

945
00:38:56,510 --> 00:39:01,400
the problem is too hard or that they're

946
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:02,990
impossible to fix I don't believe either

947
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:10,430
of those are the case but I don't

948
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:14,240
believe we're trying hard enough but I

949
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:17,600
think the researchers have the right

950
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:19,370
ideas I think DARPA too much as point I

951
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:21,350
think DARPA's doing a great job of

952
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:26,529
seating this stuff but they need help

953
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:29,240
the researchers need help so I I said

954
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:31,280
the definition of madness I when I

955
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:34,669
pitched this speech I talked about Moby

956
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:36,770
Dick a hab in Moby Dick right I get the

957
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:38,510
sense that we as a community are really

958
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:42,080
turning to Ahab and we're chasing our

959
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:44,360
white whale it's imaginary the problems

960
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:46,250
that we're trying to solve right they're

961
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:49,340
not really the problems they're just the

962
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:53,750
easy way for us to reinforce our feeling

963
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:56,000
of superiority so what can we do about

964
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:59,600
it how do we change every security

965
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:02,530
practitioner can help in some way if

966
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:05,509
you're willing number one collaborate

967
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:06,980
reach out to the researchers find out

968
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:09,650
about these technologies that are going

969
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:10,550
that are happening sit down with some of

970
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:12,230
these researchers

971
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:16,400
granted some of them are arrogant pricks

972
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:18,230
I I work with many of them I think in

973
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:21,560
order to do stuff that they're doing you

974
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:24,440
kind of have to be but they would love

975
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:26,690
to hear your insight and I'm sure you

976
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:28,190
would appreciate understanding how

977
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:30,380
they're approaching the problem I

978
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:32,210
mentioned before Draper is starting to

979
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:33,950
host an industry-wide collaboration

980
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:36,470
around the concept of inherent security

981
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:38,299
it's not meant to sell our processor

982
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:39,770
like I said we're open sourcing you know

983
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,970
most of the tools so there are some

984
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:44,020
designs that may end up getting

985
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:46,399
classified yadda yadda but there but

986
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:48,580
we're having we're hosting this

987
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:51,890
collaboration in order to bring

988
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:53,330
organizations together to say okay if we

989
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:55,040
agree that there's a big problem we

990
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:56,930
agree we can be part of the solution how

991
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:59,920
do we build an ecosystem to start

992
00:40:56,930 --> 00:41:04,339
supporting that solution space right so

993
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:07,610
reach out evaluate one of the things

994
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:09,860
that I found when I was in my ciso

995
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:13,220
position is I didn't give any time for

996
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:15,050
my employees to just tool around right I

997
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:17,450
didn't give them any sort of New

998
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:19,820
Directions hey this is a problem area

999
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:22,549
right can you go explore this I might

1000
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:24,110
say hey this vendor called me and wants

1001
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:26,380
to sell me this tool can you go valuate

1002
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:30,500
it that's not it that's not research

1003
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:31,970
that's not research um reserve time to

1004
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:34,850
take a look at this stuff give your

1005
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:37,399
employees a way to do it I I mentioned

1006
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:38,960
besides asked what do we want to say

1007
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,550
what questions do we want to ask at the

1008
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,680
CSO panel and one of the questions I

1009
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:46,070
want to ask is what are you willing to

1010
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:48,700
allow your employees to do to help your

1011
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:51,200
organization get more protected right

1012
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:52,549
and I'm not talking just internal bug

1013
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,870
bounties or something like that i'm

1014
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:57,650
talking about are you going to give them

1015
00:41:53,870 --> 00:42:01,430
time to tool right to kind of reinter

1016
00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:04,550
and participate offer researchers time

1017
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:06,799
and resources to help i'll tell you from

1018
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:10,580
my perspective i'm working on a project

1019
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:13,550
right now where if i could get object

1020
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:15,650
code from companies if I could just get

1021
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:18,140
your object code and I could you just

1022
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:21,140
allowed me to store it for example right

1023
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:23,910
so i can use it for my evaluation for

1024
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:25,109
I'm we're doing a machine learning

1025
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:27,799
he had mentioned at machine learning

1026
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:30,180
against to predict bugs and code right

1027
00:42:27,799 --> 00:42:32,220
we're going to find something at some

1028
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:34,859
point we can talk to you about it but

1029
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:37,140
we're not looking for any of your time

1030
00:42:34,859 --> 00:42:40,950
to do it other than if you give us your

1031
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:42,270
code if you're willing to write um you

1032
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:46,200
can give us old code if you want on

1033
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:48,509
earth just something to help us do it

1034
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,890
right in some cases what I've been doing

1035
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:51,329
is I've been reaching out also to other

1036
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:53,730
organizations at commercial

1037
00:42:51,329 --> 00:42:56,480
organizations and saying hey do you want

1038
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:59,250
to participate in some DARPA research

1039
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,750
are you willing to do that I mean Google

1040
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:03,599
you have lots and lots of money can you

1041
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:12,180
spare you know 100 engineers to help us

1042
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:13,980
out on this project oh thank you but we

1043
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:16,470
don't need necessarily a lot we just

1044
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:20,400
need a starting point and so what I'm

1045
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:22,439
just asking the community to do is give

1046
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,869
it a little thought offer something of

1047
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:27,299
yourself kind of get to that hacker

1048
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:28,529
mentality again and start asking well is

1049
00:43:27,299 --> 00:43:30,059
there something else that I could be

1050
00:43:28,529 --> 00:43:32,329
doing with a little bit of time a little

1051
00:43:30,059 --> 00:43:36,799
bit of money a little bit of resource

1052
00:43:32,329 --> 00:43:40,260
that could be in Ann's it could be an or

1053
00:43:36,799 --> 00:43:42,960
so that's my pitch it is now 247 I'm two

1054
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:45,349
minutes over I apologize for that are

1055
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,349
there any questions

1056
00:43:49,450 --> 00:44:12,439
from big peanut gallery over here well

1057
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:13,460
part III think I think part of the thing

1058
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:15,950
is they're there needs to be an

1059
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:17,930
educational side you know informational

1060
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:19,910
right because there are lots of

1061
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:21,950
agreements that are preventing that I

1062
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:23,990
work in the Department of Defense space

1063
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:26,419
and I try getting code from defense

1064
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:28,220
projects even though I mean please I've

1065
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:30,500
got asked if available to me I could

1066
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:32,240
keep things classified I you know can we

1067
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:33,740
just and there's that need to know sort

1068
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:37,970
of thing and it's the same problem and I

1069
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:39,680
was talking to one of the the gosh I

1070
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:41,720
forget her name at the moment the person

1071
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,100
who runs the bug bounty program for the

1072
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:46,370
the hack the Pentagon right i was

1073
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:49,549
talking to her hmm for well known the

1074
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:52,130
DoD side and i talked to her a week and

1075
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:55,220
a half ago and i asked her a very

1076
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:56,540
similar question and she said part of it

1077
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:58,459
is the educational side the

1078
00:44:56,540 --> 00:45:02,570
informational site it's making it

1079
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:06,980
available but part of it is also helping

1080
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:09,710
them understand that just because it's

1081
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:12,230
going out doesn't make it any less it

1082
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:16,130
doesn't make it any more available to

1083
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:19,250
attackers and it already is and so when

1084
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:21,290
you if you have those agreements it's

1085
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:23,540
one thing there are technologies where

1086
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:25,520
the researchers can bring it to your

1087
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:29,029
organization and you could use it there

1088
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:31,430
perhaps you can also of course I think

1089
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:34,100
as far as agreements are concerned if

1090
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:37,190
you go through the chain of people who

1091
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:40,220
are responsible for the restriction that

1092
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:42,830
you can architect some sort of way in

1093
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:45,109
order to do it it's not an easy problem

1094
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:46,819
from a contractual perspective but my

1095
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:49,070
whole thing is I'd much rather go to the

1096
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:51,250
source than to go to some you know

1097
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:53,690
further up the chain interface as

1098
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:57,290
concern so I'm not saying it's it's

1099
00:45:53,690 --> 00:46:00,520
certainly easy but it'll get easier if

1100
00:45:57,290 --> 00:46:02,500
more people start allowing it

1101
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:04,000
and part of it is a trust thing right i

1102
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:05,650
mean i can't tell you that Draper is

1103
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,070
going to hold your code and no one's

1104
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:14,290
going to get access to it right but then

1105
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:15,790
again neither can you so so there's

1106
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:17,860
there's some perception things to go

1107
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:20,140
over and stuff I I think there are

1108
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:22,060
strategies to be able to do it and I've

1109
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:23,589
worked on the contractual side of

1110
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:29,620
getting through some of those strategies

1111
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:33,660
and they're always oh I guess she's in

1112
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:33,660
control we have a question right here

1113
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:53,770
yeah I mean I I suppose I probably

1114
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:56,770
implied a few ways of how you need to

1115
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:59,800
support the users but one of the things

1116
00:46:56,770 --> 00:47:04,000
is is that our way of providing features

1117
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:06,670
to users is completely it's way too

1118
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,230
complex right we just add configurations

1119
00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:10,300
to tools that we're developing and we

1120
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:12,460
expect that as long as the capability is

1121
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:14,170
made available then the user can use it

1122
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:16,360
but we have no attention to usability

1123
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:18,040
you know what is it that users can

1124
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:20,950
actually do I don't think there's enough

1125
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:22,840
user testing about about the tools that

1126
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:24,730
are actually going into place that's

1127
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,380
that's one example and of course I'm

1128
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:29,170
biased because I started my career in IT

1129
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:33,040
as a usability engineer another way is

1130
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:34,720
simply by blaming them when something

1131
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,700
goes wrong I mean how many times have

1132
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:39,580
you heard people be blamed because they

1133
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:41,500
used a bad password rather than say well

1134
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:44,230
the whole active using passwords is

1135
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:46,660
wrong you know our the way we apply the

1136
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:48,460
way we use passwords is absolutely wrong

1137
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:50,410
we have websites today that won't let

1138
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:52,270
you copy and paste a password into the

1139
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:53,920
input field because they say that's a

1140
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:55,660
security risk but that prevents anyone

1141
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:58,350
using a password vault from being able

1142
00:47:55,660 --> 00:48:01,660
to use their secure passwords right um

1143
00:47:58,350 --> 00:48:03,819
so I think that there's that secure by

1144
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:05,740
design sort of the sort of perspective

1145
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:08,410
we need to kind of apply that to the

1146
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:10,660
community itself and understands that

1147
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:12,940
secure by design means designing user

1148
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:14,210
interactions in such a way that prevents

1149
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:19,460
them or helps them

1150
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:21,800
not break the security chain we're more

1151
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:24,230
informed than they are about the risks

1152
00:48:21,800 --> 00:49:03,339
and yet we put all the tools for them to

1153
00:48:24,230 --> 00:49:03,339
protect themselves in their hands okay I

1154
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:10,819
haven't looked at ways in in that regard

1155
00:49:09,470 --> 00:49:12,740
of course you know I'm one person

1156
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:14,480
unfocused on some sort of limited

1157
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:17,299
problem spaces right I'm familiar with

1158
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,890
some of the work and again I think it's

1159
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:20,660
really really cool work there are

1160
00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:22,339
challenges when it comes to the vast

1161
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:23,779
majority of ass number of systems that

1162
00:49:22,339 --> 00:49:25,549
we're going to start our devices that

1163
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:28,940
we're going to start talking about and

1164
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:30,920
stuff so I think that it's it's a great

1165
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:33,619
example of approaches that are being

1166
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:35,960
applied to address these problems but

1167
00:49:33,619 --> 00:49:39,440
like i said i don't have direct exposure

1168
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:41,540
in it one of the things i think there

1169
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:44,240
aren't enough people looking at things

1170
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:47,660
the way trying to bridge the gaps the

1171
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:49,819
way that a few of us are but i think

1172
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:51,920
that many of us are capable of doing it

1173
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:54,619
so it's great to hear about that and i

1174
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:57,890
think one of the big challenges comes in

1175
00:49:54,619 --> 00:50:00,230
disclosure right in talking about this

1176
00:49:57,890 --> 00:50:01,460
stuff right an academic researchers I'm

1177
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:06,680
going to come to be sides and talk about

1178
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:09,050
their work right and and well then they

1179
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:10,819
may not be able to in many many regards

1180
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:14,000
academic researchers generally don't

1181
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:16,070
care what they're allowed to do but uh I

1182
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,810
think then once you start transitioning

1183
00:50:16,070 --> 00:50:18,980
something you end up going into some

1184
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:22,040
sort of stealth mode where you don't

1185
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:23,780
want to talk about it right so so there

1186
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:25,640
there is a disclosure challenge there as

1187
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:28,040
well I think where we don't when we

1188
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:30,080
don't have any issues with

1189
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:31,790
like with these technologies everything

1190
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:33,650
I said up here is all public source

1191
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:35,210
information right there are things I

1192
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:37,130
can't talk about obviously in this

1193
00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:39,620
audience but that's all public source

1194
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:41,240
information and I'm willing to you know

1195
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:43,609
I want to do it because i think that

1196
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:45,200
there's a lot going on that we should be

1197
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:47,510
talking about and i'm just trying to put

1198
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:50,390
some more focus on having people talk

1199
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:54,220
about that side of how they're trying to

1200
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:54,220
fix that technology research side

1201
00:51:17,509 --> 00:51:27,229
uh I you know it's from my background I

1202
00:51:24,169 --> 00:51:32,859
talk about the gap areas when I'm with

1203
00:51:27,229 --> 00:51:36,348
my folks we talked about it we did I

1204
00:51:32,859 --> 00:51:37,999
generally become the voice I've become

1205
00:51:36,349 --> 00:51:41,359
the voice for the user the voice for the

1206
00:51:37,999 --> 00:51:43,189
human but funny enough our lab at the

1207
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:50,538
moment is co-located with our human

1208
00:51:43,189 --> 00:51:53,658
factors folks in at Draper so we sew and

1209
00:51:50,539 --> 00:51:55,489
I kind of take it in a different

1210
00:51:53,659 --> 00:51:57,799
direction I've been working with human

1211
00:51:55,489 --> 00:51:59,479
factors folks on identifying a new

1212
00:51:57,799 --> 00:52:01,459
solution space where we can combine

1213
00:51:59,479 --> 00:52:03,348
security and the human factor stuff in

1214
00:52:01,459 --> 00:52:06,769
order to do some really interesting

1215
00:52:03,349 --> 00:52:13,939
things around I don't want to say too

1216
00:52:06,769 --> 00:52:17,538
much around how we can model attacks and

1217
00:52:13,939 --> 00:52:19,219
how attacks work right and so I think

1218
00:52:17,539 --> 00:52:21,499
there are probably two sides of it

1219
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:23,839
there's the how do we leverage that

1220
00:52:21,499 --> 00:52:25,308
information to understand how users are

1221
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:27,019
using the tools that are available to

1222
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:28,519
them and I think we need to do more of

1223
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:30,379
that from a practitioner perspective

1224
00:52:28,519 --> 00:52:32,808
then there's the research perspective

1225
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:35,179
how can we leverage the research that

1226
00:52:32,809 --> 00:52:38,439
how they how the research they've

1227
00:52:35,179 --> 00:52:41,239
already done in behavior analysis and

1228
00:52:38,439 --> 00:52:43,308
usage analysis and all that stuff how

1229
00:52:41,239 --> 00:52:46,209
can we leverage that to understand

1230
00:52:43,309 --> 00:52:49,339
better how systems work for the user and

1231
00:52:46,209 --> 00:52:52,249
and how systems work for the attackers

1232
00:52:49,339 --> 00:52:53,569
and so I I there there are some really

1233
00:52:52,249 --> 00:52:55,848
we've been tossing around some really

1234
00:52:53,569 --> 00:52:57,349
interesting ideas and we've been

1235
00:52:55,849 --> 00:52:59,179
pitching some of them the dart bone

1236
00:52:57,349 --> 00:53:00,469
where we're we're hitting a little bit

1237
00:52:59,179 --> 00:53:03,380
of success a little bit of failure and

1238
00:53:00,469 --> 00:53:05,719
so I think I always say messaging

1239
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:07,159
usually when i get them when i fail at

1240
00:53:05,719 --> 00:53:09,199
doing something it's because i didn't

1241
00:53:07,159 --> 00:53:11,559
communicate it well enough and so we're

1242
00:53:09,199 --> 00:53:13,459
working on our messaging right now to

1243
00:53:11,559 --> 00:53:18,580
help at least communicate our ideas

1244
00:53:13,459 --> 00:53:20,640
better thank you thank you everyone

1245
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:20,640
you
