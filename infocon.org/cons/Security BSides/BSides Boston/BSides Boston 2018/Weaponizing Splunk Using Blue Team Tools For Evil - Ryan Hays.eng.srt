1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:22,020
shake of the day pressure and Ryan the

2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:24,090
PBGC fury okay so crazy through the time

3
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:27,960
talk to us a little bit about the nice

4
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:30,119
long yeah so they won't be done by 5:25

5
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,120
this is an hour long presentation so I'm

6
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:35,180
going to glance over a few things

7
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:38,519
hopefully we get at least the good stuff

8
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:40,170
so this is video I'm Ryan director of

9
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,730
security engineering at EBG which

10
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:45,200
basically just means i hack stuff and I

11
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:48,538
have to manage stuff at the same time um

12
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,309
whatnot so where does this talk come

13
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:53,910
from last year we were on a pen testing

14
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:55,320
engagement we had internal access popped

15
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,949
a couple boxes but we weren't really

16
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,199
getting anywhere

17
00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:00,210
we noticed that hey they got spunk let's

18
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:01,710
go look at it so you navigate to the web

19
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:05,339
page and it automatically logged me in

20
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:07,229
as admin like that awesome but what can

21
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:09,360
I do from there right so we look at the

22
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:11,490
data we got some new user names we've

23
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,049
got some machine to whatnot but up from

24
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:16,439
there how was I really going to leverage

25
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:18,090
that into into an attack so we were able

26
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:20,309
to build a custom app which install it

27
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,840
we get OS access that way and I'll start

28
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,430
talking about that later but then we

29
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,630
were also able to install other apps

30
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,130
that would make it that would allow us

31
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,949
to laterally move throughout the network

32
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:34,530
and basically own everything so kind of

33
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:36,030
awesome so what am I here for um I'm

34
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,079
going to kind of talk about sparks but

35
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,400
I'm going to breeze over a lot of that

36
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:41,279
because I hope most of you guys in here

37
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,590
know at least what Splunk is um the

38
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,479
basic stuff with misconfigurations that

39
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,350
we see during our engagements it's

40
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:48,750
probably the same stuff that everybody

41
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,829
else is seeing and then really into into

42
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,899
what we're here for

43
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:53,460
um so one of them we talk when I talk

44
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:55,710
about weaponizing Splunk there's really

45
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,419
three areas we're attacking the server

46
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,679
that the applications installed on or

47
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,840
interacting the organization we're

48
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,280
moving laterally and then I kind of

49
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,350
started putting together a little bit of

50
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,780
stuff where you could actually utilize

51
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:08,459
Splunk is almost a situ so you would

52
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,348
really view using a customer or

53
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:12,300
organization spoke server you'd be using

54
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:13,440
your own so that's what I'm gonna talk

55
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,960
about with attacking the data

56
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,250
and then I mean what's the use of

57
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,960
telling you how to break things if I

58
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,100
don't tell you how to fix it so we'll

59
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:24,660
kind of touch up some mitigating actions

60
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:26,489
really quickly so what is Splunk log

61
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:29,190
aggregation tool you can expand it using

62
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:30,810
python powershell bash just about any

63
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:34,079
scripting language you can you you have

64
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:35,640
out there with the expansion's it does

65
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,500
allow command execution which is really

66
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,829
cool it's the whole reason with the the

67
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,030
apps yeah I mean if anybody has any

68
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:44,310
questions these slides stop me and I

69
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,750
could talk about them too so the

70
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:47,820
misconfigurations the default password

71
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:50,010
now Spock has changed this in the recent

72
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,600
six five release but anything prior to

73
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,370
this when you installed it the default

74
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,380
password was changed me it now does

75
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:58,230
force the password reset upon

76
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:59,670
installation the older versions like I

77
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,170
talked about a minute ago they did

78
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:04,410
automatically log you in now that was

79
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:06,780
back probably version four four five so

80
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:08,190
a lot of that's been changed as well if

81
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,040
you're not using SSL you can do man in

82
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:12,540
the middle attacks and then obviously I

83
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,640
see we see this all the time especially

84
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:16,440
with the universal forwarders they're

85
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:22,170
running as root level access or system

86
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:23,940
mobile access on the windows box so

87
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:25,049
weaponizing smoke like I've talked about

88
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:29,190
a minute ago you're gonna be tacking

89
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:30,360
your the server itself and when you when

90
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,709
we attack the server we're going to be

91
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,450
looking at you know look at the logs

92
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:35,160
that are already in place on there read

93
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,929
over those I mean there's you know off

94
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,690
off logs in there I can get user names

95
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,550
um you might get web app logs in there

96
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:44,730
right now I know what what Web Apps are

97
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:45,900
out there what what configurations

98
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:50,579
they're in and what OS they might be

99
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:52,320
running local file access if spokes

100
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:54,120
burning as a root user or system user

101
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,010
right now I now have read access to

102
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,500
every file on there and there's no sort

103
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:00,390
of logging in place there and then

104
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,350
malicious applications that was what

105
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:03,029
I've talked about a minute ago where you

106
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:06,269
could install an app and we can actually

107
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:08,730
own the entire server so when we look at

108
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:10,290
attacking the organization I want to I

109
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:11,670
want to look at not only that funk

110
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:13,079
server but every other box out there

111
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,730
because all these Universal forwarder is

112
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,919
going to be deployed out and they're

113
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:18,719
going to be sitting in logs or running

114
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:20,820
applications that I write and send out

115
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,870
to them and it's finally the attack of

116
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,940
the data stuff like I've talked about

117
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:26,140
just bringing in all of our pen testing

118
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:29,210
logs

119
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:31,729
so reviewing reviewing the logs stuff

120
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:35,359
that's already there off logs I can talk

121
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:36,680
about for usernames um system logs you

122
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,570
know Windows Windows system logs

123
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,860
application logs I'll know what servers

124
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:43,520
are out there what the function of those

125
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:45,770
servers are I can get login information

126
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:49,460
from you know with Linux and Windows

127
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:51,200
boxes both so now I can I can profile my

128
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,820
target and say hey they have eight to

129
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,289
five working hours or they have a

130
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:56,750
rotating shift where everybody's working

131
00:04:54,290 --> 00:05:01,640
all day long all that thing can be

132
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:04,580
profiled out here's all the things I

133
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:05,690
just talked about here's some file or

134
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:08,300
yeah here's the files that I would

135
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:10,400
actually go to look for you know se

136
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:15,800
Shadow now I have all your hash password

137
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:20,440
hashes on the boxes um actually I have a

138
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,440
demo this one let's see here

139
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:25,520
so what we want to look at local files

140
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,320
you can add data and I can I can monitor

141
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,390
as long as I don't hit next all the way

142
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,710
to finish there's no log none of this

143
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:34,130
data is actually getting adjusted by

144
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:37,849
Splunk but I can read it so this would

145
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:39,830
be a common misconstrue is Splunk as you

146
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:42,410
know running as a root user or running a

147
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:44,270
system and I can now read in all the

148
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:46,850
passwords on a box or I could read in

149
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:48,409
the hostname or Etsy host file to see

150
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:50,630
what other boxes I communicate with and

151
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:52,010
any file really on the system there and

152
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:54,710
as I said as long as you don't keep

153
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:56,330
setting next to go to go to done stay

154
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:58,460
right here none of this information is

155
00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:04,280
log it's not brought in no one has any

156
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:09,109
idea we were over here so malicious

157
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:10,489
application Splunk something I didn't

158
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:12,380
talk about a second ago so just try to

159
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:14,150
go through it real quick smoke allows

160
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:16,100
applications to be installed usually

161
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:17,719
those applications are helpful in

162
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,730
parsing other data sets that you might

163
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,310
be bringing in but as I said it's

164
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:24,350
expandable with scripting so if you want

165
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:26,000
to write a Python shell a binder over

166
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:28,070
show or you want to write some other

167
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,460
code that you want to run on the Box you

168
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:34,450
can install that on Splunk so here's a

169
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,450
quick demo this one

170
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:40,938
so from from you're attacking machine

171
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,739
you'd I'm running Metasploit but I mean

172
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:45,129
you really could do this any any way you

173
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,129
wanted

174
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:03,490
so start up our handler will give it all

175
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,490
the options to the IPS and ports

176
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:22,180
come on

177
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:32,810
gonna allow me to guess we're going okay

178
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:36,110
so we have a handler running we're good

179
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:37,370
to go so now let's go back to Splunk

180
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:41,630
come on

181
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:44,480
catch up okay so here we're going to

182
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:45,590
login now hopefully through some sort of

183
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,150
miss configuration you have this

184
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,530
credential to login to spunk or it

185
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:51,770
automatically logs you in one of the

186
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:57,229
other we can go up top here to the

187
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:58,820
configurations for the apps we can

188
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:00,620
install this from a file because we've

189
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:02,060
already downloaded it all this stuff a

190
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:05,510
little bit is on github and the links at

191
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:07,810
the end so we'll install our app from

192
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,810
file

193
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:15,710
now there's one setting on the newest

194
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:17,660
version of Splunk on the 6'5 release

195
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:18,770
anything past six five you do have to

196
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,730
set the permissions here because you

197
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:22,219
can't set it within the configuration

198
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:25,220
file at least I don't know how if you

199
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:28,460
can so we'll set that and we'll save it

200
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:29,660
and so what this does is this installs

201
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:32,360
commands that you can run from the

202
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:33,680
search and reporting app so now we have

203
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,750
it installed we'll go over to the search

204
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,520
and reporting and you now have new

205
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,140
commands that you could run with this

206
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,939
one I only have a reverse in a bind show

207
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:42,620
but literally it could be expanded any

208
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,630
way you want so we'll run a reverse

209
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:46,190
shell since we started a matter Peter

210
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:47,720
handler we're going to do meterpreter

211
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:51,590
shell and we're going to give it the IP

212
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:53,660
to communicate to and the port and then

213
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:55,940
we just hit enter so when this this will

214
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:57,380
spin off a shelf it Forks it off so that

215
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,460
it's not sitting and running and

216
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:01,550
consuming all your resources on your

217
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:03,560
Splunk server and also if anybody

218
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:05,510
catches on it shuts down Splunk or logs

219
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,969
you out the shelf still going to still

220
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:12,340
live on so now we're logged in we have

221
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:12,340
access whatever they they give us

222
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:24,000
and obviously I can't type very well but

223
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:25,639
yeah so there we go there's that so I've

224
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,190
said everything's available on github um

225
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:33,290
it really wasn't available on the font

226
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:33,290
base for a little while about 54 minutes

227
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:39,240
there we go yeah so I submitted

228
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:42,268
submitted it to Splunk and I mean the

229
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,649
app is technically not malicious I mean

230
00:09:42,269 --> 00:09:46,009
you could be used it any way you wanted

231
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:48,690
to if you really wanted to install it um

232
00:09:46,009 --> 00:09:50,639
so yeah it got approved it was awesome

233
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:51,930
we all danced I thought it was great it

234
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:53,459
would have made it a lot easier vice

235
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:55,439
downloading this and uploading it to a

236
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:57,300
spunk server and sawing it you literally

237
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,920
could look for inside Splunk and just

238
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:05,579
hit install and be good to go but then

239
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:07,110
yeah about like 54 56 minutes later I

240
00:10:05,579 --> 00:10:08,719
got a rejection email and I'm sure

241
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:13,589
somebody got their hands slapped was

242
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:15,300
quite entertaining so we could extract

243
00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:17,160
data from smoke as well so smoke has a

244
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,839
full fully featured API the whole web

245
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:22,050
interface is all based on the API as

246
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:23,880
well um all the configuration files and

247
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:25,380
spunk they have passwords of some sort

248
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,120
if you install a Windows app for

249
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:28,589
instance and you want to talk to the

250
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,029
domain controller you have to have a

251
00:10:28,589 --> 00:10:31,500
user account to talk to the domain

252
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:34,589
controller so you want to save all that

253
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,819
stuff um smoke does do its best and it

254
00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:38,490
doesn't crypt all the passwords which is

255
00:10:35,819 --> 00:10:40,110
great and it does it does use a salt

256
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:42,120
when it encrypts them as well and that

257
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:46,199
salt is unique to each implementation so

258
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:48,420
you can't copy it over so here's just a

259
00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:50,459
demo or not a demo but a screenshot of

260
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:52,589
what you would see for instance with the

261
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:53,849
Windows app you can fill out all your

262
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:56,040
information and down there at the bottom

263
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:58,800
you'd have to give it a user at least

264
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,120
read-only access of some user nine times

265
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,639
out of ten you usually find that their

266
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,839
higher leveled and so that's what that

267
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:06,389
password look like in a configuration

268
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,250
file so it isn't correct that is it is

269
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:10,380
salted so you can't really decode it but

270
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:13,860
with about fourteen lines of Python I

271
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:14,880
can so using the split API and those

272
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,829
admin credentials that are already

273
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,009
logging in with we can run this and now

274
00:11:16,829 --> 00:11:21,599
down here at the bottom a loop stir

275
00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:23,579
every app and every configuration that's

276
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,899
available there and we do get clear text

277
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:26,899
passwords which is really awesome

278
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:34,089
so now that we've attacked the server we

279
00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:35,769
have our foothold on the server we're

280
00:11:34,089 --> 00:11:38,800
good to go there let's start attacking

281
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:40,739
everybody else in the network so as I

282
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,238
said earlier spokes based off of a

283
00:11:40,739 --> 00:11:44,739
universe smoke has universal Florida

284
00:11:43,239 --> 00:11:46,329
apps that go out to every machine that

285
00:11:44,739 --> 00:11:48,369
you want to collect logs to which

286
00:11:46,329 --> 00:11:50,138
usually at least is some high level

287
00:11:48,369 --> 00:11:53,829
machines Windows and Linux machines in

288
00:11:50,139 --> 00:11:55,209
your in your network these Universal

289
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:57,099
forwarders do allow you to run scripts

290
00:11:55,209 --> 00:12:02,018
and apps and command execution as well

291
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:04,179
so it's really cool they're all based on

292
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:06,220
a deployment server I have some

293
00:12:04,179 --> 00:12:07,509
screenshots of that there's what a

294
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:09,610
deployment server would look like you

295
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:11,589
have clients to check in they check in

296
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:13,389
on whatever interval you set usually you

297
00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:17,470
know 5 to 30 seconds to a minute

298
00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:19,089
whatever it is they split up all your

299
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,980
apps or all your apps and all your hosts

300
00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:22,420
are split up based on classes these

301
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:24,399
classes can be set up based on host

302
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:26,290
names based on operating systems to make

303
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,730
sure you install you know only windows

304
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:31,089
have some windows boxes and you don't

305
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:34,660
fill up everybody space and then all

306
00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:36,819
your apps of course so with the app that

307
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:39,009
we just installed earlier the shells app

308
00:12:36,819 --> 00:12:41,110
on there are two technology add-ons that

309
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:43,809
I have and those need to be fixed so

310
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:45,790
I'll make a note of that um there's two

311
00:12:43,809 --> 00:12:47,980
technology add-ons for Windows boxes and

312
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:50,349
Linux boxes that will allow you to once

313
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:52,209
I deploy out the application it runs the

314
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:53,799
reverse to the blind shells again and

315
00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:56,199
they all call home so in a matter of

316
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:59,129
seconds I could literally pop 60 to 80

317
00:12:56,199 --> 00:13:03,069
boxes or however many early in their or

318
00:12:59,129 --> 00:13:04,749
Metasploit crashes one-hander so the

319
00:13:03,069 --> 00:13:06,399
windows one is based on it's a bat file

320
00:13:04,749 --> 00:13:08,980
basically I run it's all based on

321
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,769
PowerShell I use a unicorn to generate

322
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:13,360
the power show or meterpreter PowerShell

323
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:14,980
payloads but again you could put

324
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:19,569
whatever the heck you wanted in there

325
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:21,519
and that would run the Linux shows they

326
00:13:19,569 --> 00:13:22,748
saw the same actually really the same

327
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,669
show that I was running on the other app

328
00:13:22,749 --> 00:13:27,429
it's python-based again it's just

329
00:13:24,669 --> 00:13:28,779
Metasploit it's all basic stuff but they

330
00:13:27,429 --> 00:13:33,519
can all be swapped out with whatever

331
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:35,499
code you wanted so here's that demo and

332
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,999
I've videotaped these because last time

333
00:13:35,499 --> 00:13:38,999
I did a live demo it all broke

334
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:49,000
so this step for the for the windows one

335
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:49,660
I use the unicorn tool um Dave is he's

336
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,270
still here

337
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:54,250
he's one I wrote it so this just

338
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:55,780
generates an output of a PowerShell

339
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,070
script that you can run any host and

340
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:59,650
it's basically phone to them gives you a

341
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:01,140
matter prashanta box so that's what that

342
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:03,010
looks like

343
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:12,189
so we're just going to copy and paste

344
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:13,569
that put that in our batch file so the

345
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:16,090
configurations that I'm editing these

346
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:26,290
are this is on the actual attacks or the

347
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:27,790
victim server so the spunk shells with

348
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:29,680
the app we installed a minute ago the

349
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:31,060
two TAS that are right there that's

350
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,260
where we're going to install we're going

351
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:34,260
to move those to be deployed

352
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,100
come

353
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,310
you

354
00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:18,229
fast forward it oh yeah it's not fast

355
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,230
forwarding oh well sorry

356
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:26,430
so we edited that now we need at the

357
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,019
linux app just to make sure that our IP

358
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:29,609
and our ports are configured correctly

359
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:31,820
we're coming back to the right attacking

360
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:31,820
box

361
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:48,290
all right so we got those set up now we

362
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:51,550
need to just go to oh when you set up

363
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:51,550
our handler first tube

364
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:18,550
it's updates on all right so we have a

365
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:21,259
handler for our windows payload

366
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:25,508
obviously we need to have one for Linux

367
00:16:21,259 --> 00:16:25,509
payload come on

368
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:46,100
any questions so far on that while this

369
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:53,508
is going it doubles of stager it is a

370
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:54,680
staged payload with Metasploit okay but

371
00:16:53,509 --> 00:16:56,059
no it's not point anything from the

372
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,258
internet it would all be from your

373
00:16:56,059 --> 00:17:03,019
attacking machine wherever you're

374
00:16:57,259 --> 00:17:05,419
sitting nope well it is but it's not

375
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:11,209
from the internet yeah it was yeah it's

376
00:17:05,419 --> 00:17:12,679
just from your attacking all rights

377
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:14,470
already got the apps here that we saw a

378
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:16,610
second ago we just can edit out some

379
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:18,409
we'll add the server classes at the

380
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:22,089
Linux payload those legs boxes windows

381
00:17:18,409 --> 00:17:22,089
give the windows vice-versa

382
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:32,899
was there another question yeah I

383
00:17:29,929 --> 00:17:34,610
recommended version yep you show the

384
00:17:32,899 --> 00:17:36,350
encrypted password menu so told me that

385
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:39,260
you didn't decrypt you just found like

386
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:41,120
this volcanic peak cryptic memory it's

387
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:42,590
not memory so the API actually goes

388
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,260
through all the configuration files so

389
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:46,939
that it can decrypt and use them I just

390
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:48,710
basically access that with the API and

391
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:51,980
said hey I'm the app I need my clear

392
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:53,210
text password and it gives it to me so

393
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:55,250
here's the meterpreter session coming

394
00:17:53,210 --> 00:18:00,740
back so you can literally pop you know

395
00:17:55,250 --> 00:18:02,070
30 40 50 boxes and so this one's still

396
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:04,680
development

397
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:06,600
as I said so this would be on my

398
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,400
attacking box i would insult Splunk and

399
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,969
then all these tools that we're under

400
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,680
our pen test and map you know Wi-Fi

401
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:15,270
pineapples any anything that we really

402
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,590
run it generates a lot of data and it

403
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,970
takes a lot of time to go through all

404
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:19,290
that data for when it comes down to

405
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:22,530
reporting and if the part I hate about

406
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:24,629
it so if we had apps and install them

407
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:27,120
and pulled all our data into Splunk

408
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:28,830
it would make our job a lot easier plus

409
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,149
it decreases that dwell time from

410
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:32,820
running an nmap scan and having to

411
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:35,490
pursue logs to find my ports now i have

412
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:37,080
it in real time so for here this is the

413
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:39,210
Wi-Fi pineapple app that i have set up

414
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,800
in real time I'd be getting data from

415
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:43,350
the device that's out there doing its

416
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:45,270
attack ID SSID that have the clients I

417
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:46,860
know what's happening um some things

418
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:48,389
that I want to do in the future is I'd

419
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,979
like to add context menus here

420
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:52,410
so that I could quickly click on

421
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:53,790
something and say hey run XYZ attack

422
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:56,190
against it and it would quickly do that

423
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:58,020
for me that's still in development and

424
00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:00,510
then another one that we like to use as

425
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:01,320
a responder so if you hadn't use

426
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:03,480
responder it's a man-in-the-middle

427
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:06,240
attack tool grabs half password hashes

428
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:08,430
from different protocols running inside

429
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,440
of a network so if I was running this in

430
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:11,880
real time I would have access to all the

431
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,800
data that told me hey how many hashes

432
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,880
have I captured what are the usernames

433
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,020
and then down there at the bottom

434
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,970
everything's blurred because this is

435
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:22,560
actually live data from a customer that

436
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:23,550
we were working with oh good so down

437
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:26,190
here at the bottom I can quickly

438
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:27,540
download that of that file that gave me

439
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:28,680
the password hashes and all the

440
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,930
information that I could feed into my

441
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:33,960
password cracker and quickly spit those

442
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:36,330
back out but uh yeah so yeah I had to

443
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,680
blur all that stuff to be on the top

444
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:39,300
right there you would have all the

445
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,620
clients that I was actually attacking

446
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:46,409
and then right below that would be

447
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:47,429
usernames okay so as I'm ending here

448
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:49,650
we'll just talk about mitigating actions

449
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:52,470
obviously it's basic updates your

450
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:54,120
software enable encryption change your

451
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:55,830
passwords and don't run this route and

452
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:58,020
there's a really cool document right

453
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:59,699
there about that link and they walk you

454
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:02,250
through probably 20 or 30 other pages

455
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,450
that you can do and here's my

456
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,430
information if anybody wants to reach

457
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:11,420
out and sorry I know it was quick but I

458
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:11,420
only had 30 minutes any other questions
