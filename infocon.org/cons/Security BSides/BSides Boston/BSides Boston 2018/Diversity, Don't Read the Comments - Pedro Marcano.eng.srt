1
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,250
you know

2
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,300
yes let's see if you feel about like

3
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,610
that after we're done they found the

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,990
topic in they gave it to me they said

5
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,880
just whatever you're uncomfortable with

6
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,610
give it to the Puerto Rican he'll take

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,020
care of it that's my job I'm the Puerto

8
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,390
Rican that just cleans up after

9
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:32,750
everybody else so I do forensics I do

10
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,820
governance I take care of bad behaviors

11
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:38,970
so why are a lot of people uncomfortable

12
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,590
with this topic the conversation starts

13
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,989
really really nicely you know there is

14
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,239
great post things there is great

15
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:48,599
research being done and then the trolls

16
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:50,730
come in so there is this really good

17
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,260
things to be said there's real numbers

18
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,120
there's all of these things out there

19
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,570
and then the conversation just very

20
00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:01,320
quickly degrades so whenever you get

21
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:03,360
into these conversations don't read the

22
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,459
comments don't listen to the comet just

23
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:13,050
bypass this thing to focus on what is at

24
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:15,508
hand so yeah questions oh okay good yeah

25
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:17,759
feel free to agree and disagree too for

26
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:20,340
that matter let's just not go too far

27
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,659
into that so definition what are we

28
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,700
going to talk about today we're not

29
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:27,570
going to talk about equality or

30
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:30,210
liberation or justice or anything any of

31
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:33,720
those things we need to get into a

32
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:35,820
position to staff some of the positions

33
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,740
that we have open and that's actually

34
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,789
where we're going to go another thing

35
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,339
that we're not going to talk about today

36
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:44,640
is we're not going to talk about how

37
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:47,100
this is so great and how having one of

38
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,509
everything is it's a good thing and it

39
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,979
do it this is not true it's not true

40
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:54,270
there's just no way that you're going to

41
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:56,220
put a whole bunch of personalities

42
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:59,570
particularly infosec personalities in

43
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:03,179
one room and they're going to get along

44
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:07,470
so what is diversity so when you look at

45
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:11,009
me a lot of people i have had Iranians

46
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:14,730
Iraqis Venezuelan so let's let's come

47
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:18,298
back to this continent Venezuelans every

48
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:20,700
every nationality of brown person so to

49
00:02:18,299 --> 00:02:24,300
speak clean me right it's like II one of

50
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:26,099
ours sec nom tiny little island a lot of

51
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,880
people don't know that it's actually a

52
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:28,590
turret

53
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,829
one of the last colonies if you actually

54
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:33,570
want to get political and it's a mess

55
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:37,290
it's a mess right now but putting that

56
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:39,000
aside it's what we perceive with the

57
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,560
five senses sometimes you know the

58
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,220
person next to you is cooking really

59
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,750
funky food they're not from here and you

60
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,690
know what do they look like and that's

61
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:50,910
how we tend to judge people okay fair

62
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:52,440
enough but if you actually start looking

63
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,450
underneath the surface and your

64
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,670
presentation happens to just go away for

65
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:58,769
some reason because you press the wrong

66
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:00,690
button you'll see that it's way more

67
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:04,050
than that right the conversation

68
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:05,700
nowadays it's in the gender right where

69
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:09,180
we're discussing a lot of gender issues

70
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:11,910
and bathroom conversations it's it's the

71
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,800
big thing that is part of the

72
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:15,540
conversation right but it's also where

73
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,450
does the person come from their politics

74
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:21,329
there the way they think their values

75
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:23,250
their beliefs is way more than just what

76
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:25,200
they look like or what they eat or

77
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:28,680
anything like that this picture is

78
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,450
floating around and it's we have

79
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,940
everything that we can see as the tip of

80
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:35,480
the iceberg and then the depth of the

81
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:37,740
person is actually way underneath that

82
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:40,049
there's a stereotype that I'm still

83
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:41,970
trying to look for it there is a there

84
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:44,580
is a little Mexican guy with a big

85
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:46,260
sombrero taking a siesta I gotta tell

86
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:48,450
you I've been to Mexico a few times have

87
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:51,030
friends that are Mexican I never seen a

88
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:53,119
mexican take a siesta now they're

89
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:59,370
fiestas though that their parties are

90
00:03:53,120 --> 00:04:02,340
wild but I never seen somebody take work

91
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:05,610
so seriously down to religious status as

92
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,290
I've seen a lot of immigrants they just

93
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:11,220
they come here to work they work really

94
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:12,750
hard and again it's like I'm still

95
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,430
looking for that little sleepy town

96
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:18,899
where I can actually take a rest and I

97
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:20,579
haven't found it so where this

98
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:23,099
conversation is going where I want to

99
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:24,900
take it where the people that write

100
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,180
these great postings want to take it

101
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:29,940
it's in a little bit more complex of a

102
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:34,140
direction this woman does anybody know

103
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:37,950
where she's from okay for the weekend

104
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:39,510
race to New York Sonia Sotomayor even

105
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,349
she's complaining about the fact that

106
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:43,620
the

107
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:45,270
words in our home state are a little bit

108
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,540
too uniform all of the judges are

109
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:50,669
familiar with white grant crime and

110
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:52,050
they're not really well versed in the

111
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:55,650
situations that they're going to be

112
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:58,590
faced as judges and what she's looking

113
00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:02,840
to do is to bring a diverse perspective

114
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:05,880
into the cases that the courts are seen

115
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:18,750
by the way this conversation is going to

116
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:20,070
be in stop doing that oh did they ok now

117
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,720
the entertainment portion I'm going to

118
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:25,980
teach you how to dance salsa in the

119
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:28,140
meantime but so I talked kind of quickly

120
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:30,990
is one of the traits that you don't

121
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:32,550
particularly see until you actually

122
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:34,740
start talking to and engaging me in

123
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:39,150
things that i really like like infosec

124
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:42,510
and politics so long as you know bring

125
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:48,090
them into the right we keep them at the

126
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:49,770
right level and so anyway let's see so

127
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:52,080
the issues whether we have security

128
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:54,659
security right now it's kind of like

129
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,870
diet and health we're spending a ton of

130
00:05:54,660 --> 00:06:02,280
money we're getting success as we move

131
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:06,600
forward we improve a lot and then cake

132
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:08,909
happens or insecurity we get breached so

133
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:12,990
we get pulled in different directions I

134
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:14,640
in the late 80s Early 90s it was all

135
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:16,800
your hacker you you Sakura thing you

136
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:20,039
break things can you prevent people from

137
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:23,400
breaking in can you change my mortgage

138
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:27,150
for my grades it's like well yeah but I

139
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:29,370
don't want to go to jail so in diets

140
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:31,650
most a lot of the diets fail there's

141
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:33,960
there's no commitment in diversity kind

142
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:35,039
of the same thing happens there is yeah

143
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:39,060
we're going to create a diversity

144
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:40,950
program we have these great successes in

145
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,000
infosec kind of the same thing we're

146
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,050
actually going to secure all these

147
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,960
things we're going to implement the

148
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:47,970
million dollars worth of new hardware

149
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,409
and then it fails we're back to the

150
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:51,990
drawing board well how about we get a

151
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:53,639
new risk management framework how about

152
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:56,030
we get some new tools let's do some new

153
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:58,860
scanning let's get a new perspective and

154
00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:01,409
it just is kind of like we keep going up

155
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:03,509
and down up and down and we don't get

156
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:05,580
anywhere so let's just jump on a new fad

157
00:07:03,509 --> 00:07:08,039
let's see what happens then in the

158
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:12,139
meantime we're going along with a whole

159
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:17,310
bunch of positions that are still open

160
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:21,030
so the conversation it scoops the

161
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:24,599
conversation needs to be about people

162
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:26,280
the life where later aight the the

163
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:28,919
problem that exists between the keyboard

164
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:31,619
and the chair it needs to be mu it needs

165
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:34,320
to be moved towards why can the human do

166
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,970
to actually secure the enterprise and

167
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,729
where do we get more of these humans

168
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:42,419
it's been about what the blue team needs

169
00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:45,740
to secure to secure the flag from the

170
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:49,698
red team what can your employees do to

171
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:52,289
defend themselves from attackers and

172
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:53,880
again there is no matter how many tools

173
00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:57,240
you put out there no matter how much

174
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:59,280
money you put out their tools money

175
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:06,659
resources you throw this problem there's

176
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:08,070
just not gonna be enough so not bad I'm

177
00:08:06,659 --> 00:08:10,169
having a lot of problems doing

178
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:12,000
presentations nowadays because it's I

179
00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:15,650
want to hit the most people and when I

180
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:20,099
present the a-team I said should be

181
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:23,520
people think of Oh Liam Neeson no this

182
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:28,139
is the 18 there is no other 18 there's

183
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:29,758
no more there's no other so as you can't

184
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:34,680
these the group does anybody recognize

185
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:43,640
the top picture NASA specifically which

186
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:47,790
team up Apollo 1 2 3 4 5 6 the moon 11

187
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:51,149
yes so one thing that these teams have

188
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:54,740
in common is a door diverse there was a

189
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:58,350
lot of issues in the 80s about

190
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:59,459
objectification of women in the 18 but

191
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,259
she was there

192
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:03,899
to me there was a woman that was mostly

193
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:06,860
part of the team but these are the guys

194
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:10,709
that that were the face of that group

195
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:14,040
then we get SNL saturday night live one

196
00:09:10,709 --> 00:09:16,258
of the most successful runs that they

197
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,149
had was with this team of crazy people

198
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:21,689

199
00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:24,050
gentlemen so if this keeps going we're

200
00:09:21,689 --> 00:09:26,368
going to switch to salsa lessons okay

201
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:28,498
which in the end may or may not be more

202
00:09:26,369 --> 00:09:38,089
productive but definitely will be more

203
00:09:28,499 --> 00:09:41,730
fun so what was that go ahead so

204
00:09:38,089 --> 00:09:46,499
question your team at home at work

205
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:49,879

206
00:09:46,499 --> 00:09:51,779
within your team all of these skills or

207
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:57,829

208
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:57,829

okay in very large companies this is

221
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:54,559
these are broken down and you know it's

222
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:58,319

237
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:58,120

240
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,040
the verse you think you are there's

241
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:07,810
always the attackers are going to throw

242
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,060
something at you that you may not be

243
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,829
ready for and what you think with that

244
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:15,040
and what you think you need it before

245
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:19,300
the attack it just gets thrown out of

246
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:21,569
the window somebody had a source this

247
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:24,089
week said everybody has a plan until

248
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:30,130
they actually get punched in the face

249
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:32,380
Mike Tyson yes somebody used that I at

250
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:34,570
source and what ends up happening is

251
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:36,070
sure you actually have all of these

252
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:38,529
plans you have all of these people you

253
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:41,350
have this awesome team and then you get

254
00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:45,990
a curve that my friends was a phone call

255
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:49,779
from a hacktivist in South America that

256
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:51,970
called the corporation and all he cares

257
00:12:49,779 --> 00:12:54,490
about is the politics of the corporation

258
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:57,310
and he just said I'm going to attack

259
00:12:54,490 --> 00:13:02,670
your corporation this is what I'm gonna

260
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:05,439
do go out defend against it good luck so

261
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:07,209
if you actually had somebody that spoke

262
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,190
Spanish and that actually looked this

263
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:13,689
good then you could actually

264
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,690
couldn't say that with a straight face

265
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:19,400
you would actually be in a better

266
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:21,140
position to defend your corporation and

267
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,750
again it may or may not happen that

268
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:27,050
easily but by the time you get the phone

269
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:29,930
call who knows what's going to happen so

270
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:31,640
what we have right now is we actually

271
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:34,189
have a lot of external factors

272
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:38,600
controlling what we do as incident

273
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:41,120
responders even as product managers we

274
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:44,750
have a lot of people that are getting

275
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:48,140
packed because of social engineering the

276
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:53,690
counts of fishing that it's that is

277
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:55,520
coming in for CEOs it's just it is

278
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:57,500
incredibly high as to how successful

279
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:03,020
they are last night we were sitting at a

280
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:05,450
table discussing InfoSec in politics and

281
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:06,829
what then this election happens one of

282
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:08,420
the people at the table got an alert

283
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:11,000
that somebody was trying to hack into

284
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:14,380
his account relatively high level

285
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,090
individual inner product corporation and

286
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:19,070
of course he doesn't respond very well

287
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:23,240
to Authority he doesn't respond very

288
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:25,430
well to getting you know click this to

289
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:28,550
actually change your you know it just

290
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:29,989
doesn't go then on the other side you

291
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:32,390
actually have a lot of people that are

292
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:34,280
very angry as to what corporations and

293
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:37,040
and particularly in this country are

294
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:40,010
doing so you get an activism and then

295
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:42,050
the worst thing seven thousand dollars

296
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:45,110
for example to just to pick a number

297
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:48,020
it's a lot of money in in other

298
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:51,230
countries it's what somewhat some

299
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:53,300
families make together in a year so for

300
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:55,760
a relatively amount for a relatively

301
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:57,880
small amount of money you have somebody

302
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,650
that is going to dedicate their life to

303
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:02,689
trying to get into your corporation to

304
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:11,890
get your secret's out or just to cause

305
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:11,890
mayhem if they shorted your stock so HR

306
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:25,300
I eat how do you know 022 yeah they just

307
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:26,920
click yeah its first of all right if you

308
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,060
actually if you're hacktivists right if

309
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,949
you're actually trying to break into a

310
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:31,750
corporation and you can get through what

311
00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:34,060
are you gonna do if you fall short

312
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:36,250
technically you go recruit someone that

313
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:39,008
is already angry and there we have it

314
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:42,009
ladies and gentlemen non-malicious

315
00:15:39,009 --> 00:15:45,279

317
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:50,050

of people do not want to security

330
00:16:30,309 --> 00:16:36,839
awareness we talk about individuals who

331
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:36,839
either intentionally or unintentionally

332
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:52,660
it it's ugly there was a talk this week

333
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:54,069
at source about insiders and the nation

334
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,600
states that love them if you can

335
00:16:54,069 --> 00:16:58,628
actually watch the recording it was

336
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:01,779
great it's scary the amount of money

337
00:16:58,629 --> 00:17:04,829
that it takes to recruit someone that is

338
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:11,049
disgruntled most of the successful

339
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:13,990
attacks exfiltration data that happen in

340
00:17:11,049 --> 00:17:15,939
corporations it's the range of money

341
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:17,890
that they get is between a thousand and

342
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:19,689
ten thousand dollars which in this

343
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:22,780
country is pocket change in other places

344
00:17:19,689 --> 00:17:25,179
is a lot of money but these are people

345
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:27,399
in corporations with white collar jobs

346
00:17:25,179 --> 00:17:29,830
that are just

347
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:34,780
getting paid peanuts to to just do

348
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:36,879
damage genuinely not only am I not being

349
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:38,260
wounded are they not malicious but they

350
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,990
don't realize what to do it for doing

351
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:43,870
this problem a former employer might had

352
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:45,640
a ton of fraud situation where attackers

353
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:47,729
collect socially engineered collected

354
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:50,410
pieces of information from different

355
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:52,120
employees of the organization and once

356
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:54,990
they had enough pieces were able to

357
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:58,179
submit fraudulent orders to our vendors

358
00:17:54,990 --> 00:18:01,660
and then made mom make off with more

359
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:03,370

that's like none of the targets inside

362
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:09,820
our organization malicious none of them

363
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:12,160
knew they were helping owners that were

364
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:16,389
paid off and then we're bad people ah

365
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:19,690
but things people can do wrong type of

366
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:21,670
the causing problems without because

367
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:23,500

375
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:50,889
people sent it back within the day I'd

376
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:52,780
ended a test of a financial of their

377
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:56,790
financial department I asked for a

378
00:18:52,780 --> 00:19:00,790
million-dollar million dollars and I

379
00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:04,180
didn't get it but I did ask for 25,000

380
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:08,590
and before I came back from lunch the

381
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:11,200
money was transferred so it's just it's

382
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:14,199
amazing yes people want to help that's

383
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:16,630
our nature but there's control in place

384
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:20,410
yeah there's control and it was email it

385
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:24,340
wasn't a lot of work and I made the

386
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:28,090
email ugly everything was well spell but

387
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:31,350
it was it we try to make it silly on

388
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:35,820
purpose and it just it worked it worked

389
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:35,820
you were okay

390
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:43,289
so then we have HR and recruiters and

391
00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:48,090
they make our teams look like this very

392
00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:51,269
capable very energetic energetic they

393
00:19:48,090 --> 00:20:00,379
had their is experience I saw anybody

394
00:19:51,269 --> 00:20:06,509
not caught up with this is it right um

395
00:20:00,379 --> 00:20:08,039
but she said it yeah so there's former

396
00:20:06,509 --> 00:20:13,559
dead people here to make it even more

397
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:17,490
diverse so it's it's you know great team

398
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:20,279
great team but you know they actually

399
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:21,629
have really predictable tactics right

400
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:23,159
this is what we're gonna do we're going

401
00:20:21,629 --> 00:20:25,740
to move together as a unit we're gonna

402
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:29,580
go left we're gonna go right everybody's

403
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:32,580
going to be honorable and let's fight in

404
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:34,559
line and let's get this done and then

405
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:37,019
the attackers come in and they throw

406
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:42,450
everything they can at you right old

407
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:45,870
ladies frozen dead people Giants

408
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:48,120
red-haired people actually that was one

409
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:51,689
of the one of the memes that was going

410
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:53,699
around at redheads heart no soul but I'm

411
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:58,169
glad that one this over I happen to like

412
00:20:53,700 --> 00:21:01,289
redheads a lot and so they throw

413
00:20:58,169 --> 00:21:03,059
anything they can they want and then

414
00:21:01,289 --> 00:21:04,408
then you're left with you know the

415
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:08,759
Spanish phone code that you don't know

416
00:21:04,409 --> 00:21:10,590
what to do with so the worst thing that

417
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:13,289
happens is you get a phone call saying I

418
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:15,658
have a great opportunity for you right

419
00:21:13,289 --> 00:21:18,389
and it happens to be a resume that you

420
00:21:15,659 --> 00:21:20,669
posted about 10 years ago that somebody

421
00:21:18,389 --> 00:21:23,610
sucked out of a database and you're

422
00:21:20,669 --> 00:21:25,590
getting cold to do tech support and you

423
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:28,439
haven't done tech support in the last 15

424
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:30,899
years or your career so yes I am a

425
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:33,240
senior recruiter my name is John I have

426
00:21:30,899 --> 00:21:36,120
a very thick accent from nowhere in this

427
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:38,070
country and I'm here to offer you

428
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:43,379
something and it's for your corporation

429
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:45,689
and there we have it so you get this

430
00:21:43,379 --> 00:21:47,668
phone call and then you get this if

431
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:49,120
you're actually the the hiring manager

432
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:51,280
you get this great

433
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,929
eat resumes from people that don't

434
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,610
really want to talk to you I was just

435
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:57,010
talking to someone at source Mike Taylor

436
00:21:54,610 --> 00:22:00,040
that said he got a resume from an

437
00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:02,670
individual that I wanted to do

438
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:05,200
metasploit as part of their job and

439
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:07,360
metasploit is a great product and if you

440
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,190
use that for pen testing or just to

441
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,320
cover the bases you know that is pretty

442
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:13,540
much a wizard you just you can put in a

443
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:17,590
wizard mode and you walk through it so

444
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:20,680
this individual asked for a hundred and

445
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:22,840
eighty thousand dollar salary to click

446
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:24,250
through a security tool and there was

447
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:27,100
nothing else he knew how to do by the

448
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:29,320
way so if you happen to be in this room

449
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:31,600
I want to hire you but I'm gonna put

450
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,610
your my sales team okay because if you

451
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:40,689
got that kind of money for that level of

452
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:44,169
job I mean hats off yeah yeah I mean 180

453
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:45,850
kick to run a wizard it's like the

454
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:49,210
clippy that Microsoft used to have in

455
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:51,280
the corner hey do you need help yeah

456
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:57,309
called their metasploit guy he's

457
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:59,590
clipping so we actually have regardless

458
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:02,730
how many bad resumes we get what we have

459
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:04,959
right now is we have a huge gap in

460
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:08,650
resources particularly impede on the

461
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:11,500
people side we have great tools awesome

462
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:14,650
budgets city that got hacked last year

463
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:17,230
was in the tens of millions just

464
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:19,570
insecurities I don't know about any of

465
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:21,580
you but if I had a 10 million dollar

466
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:23,710
budget for security I wouldn't be here

467
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:26,199
giving this talk I'll be in Mexico

468
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:28,120
sitting down looking for that mystical

469
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,040
village will the Mexican sit down and

470
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:32,860
just take siestas the rest of the day

471
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:35,770
but depending on who you ask right now

472
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:37,209
there's an awesome black screen that I

473
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:40,870
was just going to point that there is a

474
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:43,920
million jobs out there just in infosec

475
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:46,000
and that are open that are unfilled

476
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:48,610
there's a million jobs open out there

477
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I'm going to this guy by 2020 there's

478
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:55,240
going to be a million and a half right

479
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:58,050
however the good old US government says

480
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,050
there are

481
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:10,139
in 2014 there was 80 2900 security

482
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:12,399
professionals out there and to make

483
00:24:10,139 --> 00:24:16,418
90,000 you need a bachelor's degree in

484
00:24:12,399 --> 00:24:18,610
less than five years of experience okay

485
00:24:16,419 --> 00:24:21,690
these are the numbers that are a lot of

486
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:26,258
corporations use to pick your salaries

487
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:28,029
right good luck getting somebody with

488
00:24:26,259 --> 00:24:30,100
that level of experience here in

489
00:24:28,029 --> 00:24:31,840
Cambridge for example where they're just

490
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:36,269
people just go across the street and

491
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:38,799
they get a 30-percent salary increase so

492
00:24:36,269 --> 00:24:40,870
by the way there's two categories that

493
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:43,480
if you actually do the search for

494
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:45,250
information security that come up you're

495
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:51,129
either an information security analyst

496
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:53,139
any of those in the room ha one yeah so

497
00:24:51,129 --> 00:24:55,840
you are the person that they're counting

498
00:24:53,139 --> 00:24:58,360
here none of these are the good people

499
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:01,360
and then database administrators their

500
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:04,508
response they're responsible for setting

501
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:07,750
permissions on databases and keep any

502
00:25:04,509 --> 00:25:09,879
user is limited to the data I think

503
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:13,120
these are the guys that are skipping

504
00:25:09,879 --> 00:25:16,029
their jobs signal injection and all

505
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:21,158
those tanks anyway no hating on the

506
00:25:16,029 --> 00:25:22,539
database admins so however they're

507
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:24,610
saying that we're gonna experience an

508
00:25:22,539 --> 00:25:28,179
18-percent a full eighteen percent

509
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:32,580
growth and yes so you start with the

510
00:25:28,179 --> 00:25:35,830
left and then yes and then you step back

511
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:37,299
yes and then you step back with the

512
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:41,110
right and then you bring it to the

513
00:25:37,299 --> 00:25:44,950
middle that salsa okay so if you want to

514
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:46,508
look really really good in a in a cruise

515
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:51,879
anybody going on vacation on a cruise

516
00:25:46,509 --> 00:25:54,070
this this summer so this is see I can

517
00:25:51,879 --> 00:25:56,620
move my hips too and that's it that's

518
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:58,029
your lesson for this information we're

519
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:01,779
going to go back to our schedule

520
00:25:58,029 --> 00:26:03,370
presentation in three so there's going

521
00:26:01,779 --> 00:26:05,529
to be a full eighteen percent increase

522
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:07,330
if you actually if you if you do numbers

523
00:26:05,529 --> 00:26:09,820
you know that if twenty percent of

524
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:11,439
positions and your company are open or

525
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:14,620
in your department

526
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:21,659
anybody have 10 people in their

527
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:32,529
Department security in 10 don't be shy

528
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:39,850
20 more than 50 people Wow one you're

529
00:26:32,529 --> 00:26:42,940
the sole security person yes okay you

530
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:45,158
got a person on a hell yeah so you know

531
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:47,500
that if you actually have eighteen

532
00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:50,289
percent vacancies in your in your in

533
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:53,139
your department you're in trouble so the

534
00:26:50,289 --> 00:26:55,590
good ol bureau of labor statistics is

535
00:26:53,139 --> 00:26:58,750
saying that we're actually going to have

536
00:26:55,590 --> 00:27:02,620
14,000 positions open in the next eight

537
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:04,960
years so i decided to figure out where

538
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:07,120
were the security people and I just pick

539
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,340
one of the amine regardless of how you

540
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:12,340
feel about certifications this is not

541
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:14,370
the cissp is not easy to get it's a

542
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:18,279
hassle you need five years of experience

543
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:22,360
you need a boring test and really thick

544
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:24,220
books unless you have the experience but

545
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,658
you can pass it it within a year you'll

546
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:33,600
be ready to pass it from zero to

547
00:27:25,659 --> 00:27:39,220
certified and there are 77,000 again

548
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:42,779
82,000 jobs open or filled with 14,000

549
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:49,799
positions that are going to be open by

550
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:54,490
20 22 24 coming praying for there's

551
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:57,418
77,000 cissp s that's not counting the

552
00:27:54,490 --> 00:28:01,570
rest of the ISC square certifications

553
00:27:57,419 --> 00:28:03,399
let alone g act or anything else the

554
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:06,129
biggest wrong and i was for coming to

555
00:28:03,399 --> 00:28:08,610
try to do this what boy and what we were

556
00:28:06,129 --> 00:28:11,980
trying to do is actually have real time

557
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:14,290
yeah really distinguish Princeton I

558
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:17,919
at least eight times at the edge off

559
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:21,418
doesn't change you call information

560
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:23,830
security office you could call a lead

561
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:25,929
principal security engineer he could be

562
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:31,000
call the principal security analyst and

563
00:28:25,929 --> 00:28:36,130
it's very hard to compare these no cause

564
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:38,890
it's very very different how do you try

565
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:40,750
to do that I took four offices what

566
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:47,010
certifications what experience how do

567
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:49,570
you move people of the land large people

568
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:51,510
jobs posted they're all using job

569
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:55,629
descriptions as I must be is the speed

570
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:57,250
of VSM please no idea is I'm experience

571
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:59,770
Isis Joe wants one to two years

572
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:02,440
experience NSE is fit the debt they are

573
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:04,450
out but it's almost like people copy and

574
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:07,390
it is for every single job now realize

575
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:09,010
it was great diversity oh yeah and and

576
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:10,830
all of the jobs that you mentioned

577
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:12,400
happen to have some sort of security

578
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:14,409
responsibility which you would think

579
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:16,900
will make it easy to search but again I

580
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:19,179
try to account for that looking for the

581
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:21,250
all the security jobs there's two

582
00:29:19,179 --> 00:29:28,980
descriptions that actually include that

583
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:31,419
I'm there we have it right now

584
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:33,640
engineering type but also involve a

585
00:29:31,419 --> 00:29:36,130
security risk management correct and GF

586
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:38,230
which are the hardcore you know Cee age

587
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:41,080
and whether you like certification or

588
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:43,960
not I just used it as the guideline just

589
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:46,889
to figure out who self-identifies versus

590
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:50,830
what our government thinks and it just

591
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:58,210
it was ridiculous in 32 you've had it

592
00:29:50,830 --> 00:30:00,100
almost end excellent so facts regardless

593
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:03,100
how you feel about certifications as to

594
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:04,918
what your team composition is we're not

595
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:08,110
expecting a problem we have a problem

596
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:10,510
right it's we're lacking the human

597
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:12,250
resources that we need to move some of

598
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:15,340
their programs forward and to keep the

599
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:16,660
corporation secure even at eighteen

600
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:18,840
percent that the government says we're

601
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:21,370
actually going to have these vacancies

602
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:22,870
we're heading towards a chaos we're

603
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:24,459
going to have to start hiring people and

604
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:26,889
bringing them along

605
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:28,900
and ask good security professionals we

606
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:30,550
all know we can't solve the problem but

607
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:32,140
we can mitigate it we can make things a

608
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:33,490
little bit better I'm about to switch

609
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:38,050
into Puerto Rican mode because this

610
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:42,280
dance with with the computer has made us

611
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:45,820
lose a lot of time so let's take women

612
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:48,550
for example in IT not security specific

613
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:51,820
that that became very hard to find 51

614
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:55,210
percent of the population it's it's

615
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:58,000
female fifty-nine percent is actually

616
00:30:55,210 --> 00:31:00,070
make up the general labor force however

617
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,020
once you start getting down into IT you

618
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:07,540
start seeing thirty percent thirty-five

619
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:09,430
percent and lower once they actually you

620
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:11,649
know good good for the women once they

621
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:15,490
get hired a lot of them gravitates

622
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:17,770
towards management depending on how you

623
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:20,950
feel about this it's a fact women

624
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:25,030
communicate better if not better more

625
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:28,150
but the reality is they're they're

626
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:30,610
better communicators in general that's

627
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:33,220
not so I thought to some of the research

628
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:35,320
endeavors on so the women's that women

629
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:37,090
including the problem is missing to

630
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,860
determine communicate better Pablo is

631
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:41,169
starting in about fourth grade and

632
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:44,740
continuing all the way through c-level

633
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:47,260
executives in women ditch technology and

634
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:49,780
ditch computing faster than that whoo

635
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:51,940
from middle school to high school more

636
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:54,040
women say yeah I'm going in liberal arts

637
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:55,750
to hell with this than men from high

638
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:57,879
school to college for women stay on top

639
00:31:55,750 --> 00:32:00,280
of this and it's not because when they

640
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:02,770
are better communicators or women are

641
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:04,540
nurturers the women are dumb a lot of

642
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:08,590
the evidence suggests you ask them and

643
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:11,680
why do you need why did you bail it has

644
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:14,679
to do with hostility and culture yep

645
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:16,780
women don't leave because they want to

646
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:18,670
communicate women leave because people

647
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:21,510
are jerks and they're done with it yeah

648
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:21,510
so

649
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:31,880
yeah so I'm gonna be around all day

650
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:34,760
let's let's start getting start getting

651
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:37,850
closer to to the end because this is

652
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:39,470
this is the facts right these are the

653
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:41,679
numbers that we need to bring back and

654
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:44,660
present this study came out this week

655
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:46,100
from how the Massachusetts tech

656
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:48,980
ecosystem is creating new growth

657
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:53,629
opportunities from mass TLC go check it

658
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:57,350
out they their main claim is that we

659
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:59,750
have now surpassed Silicon Valley as the

660
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:02,810
place to work in technology again

661
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:06,740
arguable but hey let's go let's go with

662
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:08,690
that what it does show is that women are

663
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:10,390
definitely underrepresented they have a

664
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:15,350
claim of thirty five thirty five percent

665
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:18,770
in tech in Massachusetts yeah check the

666
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:21,889
study whoever wants this presentation

667
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:26,000
I'll give it to them nothing here that

668
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:27,410
is secret so diversity to me if I was

669
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,380
looking for a candidate today I'm

670
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:32,690
looking for an open mind somebody that

671
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:34,880
is curious self driven and that brings

672
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:38,260
that and manifest that into innovation

673
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:41,330
give me a new solution to an old problem

674
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:44,150
you know sim by itself and aggregating

675
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:45,939
logs is not solving our issue we need to

676
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:49,160
figure out how we're going to embrace

677
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:52,700
this that this future that that where we

678
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:56,750
going to be underpowered and then outgun

679
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:58,520
in defending our enterprises so the new

680
00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:00,380
tyler ward looks something like this i

681
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:02,710
wanted to actually interact a little bit

682
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:05,180
more but even holy wood had this right

683
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:06,860
Angelina Jolie does he bring anybody

684
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:13,639
know where that her grandparents are

685
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:18,710
from their slow backs so Hollywood had

686
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:22,009
diversity right right mr. robot yeah

687
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:27,770
well hey hey hacker teams these are

688
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:30,410
hacker teams okay this two guys mr.

689
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:34,159
robot pretty cool show where you believe

690
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:38,118
it or not it's it's fun

691
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:39,980
he was at RSA this year uh if you guys

692
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:44,210
don't know where who he is hes from

693
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:47,440
egypt right and the guy that got crushed

694
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:49,879
in the elevator and mission impossible

695
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:55,760
mr. Stevens does anybody know where he's

696
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:58,400
from Irish in Spanish so again there in

697
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,109
the pursuit of beauty they have come up

698
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:03,079
with these individuals that happened to

699
00:35:00,109 --> 00:35:04,940
be relatively diverse the two women on

700
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:08,480
the top are not from Hollywood there are

701
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:09,740
actually real hackers and I wish I could

702
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:14,599
tell you more about it but we're running

703
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:16,939
out of time so look around this room you

704
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:22,579
know we're relatively diverse but who's

705
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:24,680
missing right we need all guys for one I

706
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:26,589
don't know people I'm sorry people with

707
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:36,288
experience now you guys look too young

708
00:35:26,589 --> 00:35:41,000
way too young Oh older make this air we

709
00:35:36,289 --> 00:35:42,799
got a relative mix so to me age this

710
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,779
experience I know that once in

711
00:35:42,799 --> 00:35:49,160
technology pretty much once you hit 30

712
00:35:44,779 --> 00:35:51,980
your unhireable once you hit your 40s

713
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:54,710
it's they want you out if you're there

714
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:57,619
by 55 and you know and you don't get

715
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:59,720
laid off more power to you just an

716
00:35:57,619 --> 00:36:01,400
interesting and disturbing factor in

717
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:03,410
Silicon Valley at a lot of plastic

718
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:05,809
surgeons are seeing more and more young

719
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:15,890
men who are going to get are getting

720
00:36:05,809 --> 00:36:22,490
surgery so there we go also gave the

721
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:28,759
derrick with that so also maybe two yeah

722
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:33,770
is she better government over hey so to

723
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:35,569
me H is its I came to experience racing

724
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:37,520
different cultures they bring a

725
00:36:35,569 --> 00:36:39,770
different perspective I was doing this

726
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,599
presentation and I dare say that women

727
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:45,759
communicate better so I just leave in

728
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:47,600
the blanks my wife that she definitely

729
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,310
only when we

730
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:51,230
I was doing this presentation I decided

731
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:53,960
to leave my perspective of what women

732
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:57,110
bring to the job out of this I like to

733
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:58,940
fill in the blank and different

734
00:36:57,110 --> 00:37:03,440
backgrounds in education mean different

735
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:06,170
solutions so I wanted to bring an

736
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:09,200
exercise if you were building the

737
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:10,910
perfect security person what are the

738
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:14,149
skills and what are the qualities that

739
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:18,200
you would bring that you will want them

740
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:20,890
to have to me certification is less

741
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:24,620
important but curiosity and passion are

742
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:27,200
definitely critical I don't advocate

743
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:28,850
that you go out to the to the HR

744
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:32,089
supermarket and you get yourself one of

745
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:34,040
everything get yourself capable people

746
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:35,900
that exhibit these straits and if you

747
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:37,850
can try to bring in different

748
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:39,800
perspectives when two candidates are

749
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:42,020
equal and one of them can actually bring

750
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:45,080
a different perspective think about that

751
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:49,220
when you're building your team when does

752
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:51,049
the next presenter start okay so I'm

753
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:52,970
gonna steal a steal you for a couple

754
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:56,180
more minutes because I'm gonna ask you

755
00:37:52,970 --> 00:38:02,540
for your help very potent MI osita a

756
00:37:56,180 --> 00:38:04,339
survey of members their experiences

757
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:07,009
security and one of the things that

758
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:08,600
stood out to me was a turn to the things

759
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:10,760
that work for them and their security

760
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:12,650
leaders okay one is technical acumen to

761
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:18,020
is business acumen free was

762
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:20,720
communication so there we have it so

763
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:23,630
what can you do mentor people sponsor

764
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:25,069
more people go out and recruit if you

765
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:27,890
actually look at your company's HR

766
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:30,350
materials and you wouldn't go to work

767
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:32,029
there today just have a talk with them

768
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:35,509
show them the cool projects that you're

769
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:39,080
working on every time I start speaking

770
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:41,540
security to somebody that is an outsider

771
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:44,090
normal as somebody called them this week

772
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:46,250
they get really really excited what we

773
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:49,870
do is pretty cool and there's so many

774
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:52,670
things that we can do here code

775
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:55,910
debugging the gender gap I'm trying to

776
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:58,520
put together a screening of this movie

777
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:59,810
to keep the conversation going this was

778
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,370
the one change that I made to my

779
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:05,120
presentation today this showdown

780
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:06,859
check it out code documentary calm if we

781
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:08,900
if we can actually if you have some

782
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:11,000
extra energy and want to contribute to

783
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:17,510
this let's let's say we can bring this

784
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:19,250
to Boston well I want to see if because

785
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:24,800
I don't I can't do it by myself I have a

786
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:27,440
day job too I don't know yet but see

787
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:33,290
this is what I need other other offers

788
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:37,130
other ideas so um what's happening out

789
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:39,770
there ah let's see these two guys

790
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:45,340
they're doing security and promoting the

791
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:49,220
curriculum in the in bars for free so

792
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:51,680
this happened last year talk to these

793
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:54,200
people about talking about bringing

794
00:39:51,680 --> 00:40:06,980
better curriculums to the schools Nick

795
00:39:54,200 --> 00:40:08,960
ciao Roy thank you oh no that's that's

796
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:12,740
what's happening that's what's happening

797
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:15,410
corporations for example NASA sit-in in

798
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:17,569
the University of Puerto Rico magic ways

799
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:21,680
and they just take all the engineers out

800
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:24,320
of Puerto Rico and then they do the same

801
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:26,299
thing with pharmacy not NASA but CVS

802
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,740
Walgreens and all of that they go to

803
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:30,730
Puerto Rico recruit them these people

804
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:34,759
are bilingual they'd like diversity and

805
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:36,710
things I will comment on my volunteer at

806
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:39,950
a collegiate cyber security competition

807
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:41,960
every year and we have to go before the

808
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:44,180
college level and start educating yes

809
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:46,850
even in grade school and middle school

810
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:49,250
or high school because even to today I

811
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:51,799
was at competition in March and the

812
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:55,400
students are still there education and

813
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:57,410
college at bachelor's and master's level

814
00:40:55,400 --> 00:41:00,050
is still focusing on network and

815
00:40:57,410 --> 00:41:02,450
perimeter stop they're not hearing about

816
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:05,339
applications yeah you're about to get

817
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:10,890
these two starting

818
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:12,930
so women in cybersecurity nicks there's

819
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:14,609
a free environment where word veterans

820
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:17,368
can actually test their cybersecurity

821
00:41:14,609 --> 00:41:19,710

aware of your gaps look for passion not

832
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:55,259
certifications and look for aptitude not

833
