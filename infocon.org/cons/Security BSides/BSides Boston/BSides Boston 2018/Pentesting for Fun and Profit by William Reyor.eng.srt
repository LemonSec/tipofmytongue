7
00:00:22,509 --> 00:00:37,370
key cissp we're sure so this socket is

8
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,839
focused on people who hire pen testing

9
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:41,419
companies or wanna hire pen testing

10
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:43,760
companies and people who want to become

11
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:47,690
pen registers and getting to offensive

12
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,760
security work so I've tried to book this

13
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:53,059
into two different parts so one part

14
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,070
focuses on people who hire pen testing

15
00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:57,500
companies and pen testers in general and

16
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:59,840
then for people who want to get into

17
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:03,850
that line of work to work now for

18
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:06,770
Fairfield University in a defensive role

19
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:10,420
my co-founded security Assad's

20
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:13,819
Connecticut and that's a hackerspace

21
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:16,090
LGBT supporter you can follow me on

22
00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:16,090
Twitter

23
00:01:18,219 --> 00:01:25,960
so first section for folks that are

24
00:01:22,689 --> 00:01:27,889
hiring a pen testing company I would say

25
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,750
one of the questions you want to ask

26
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,490
yourself before you even have this

27
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:35,840
conversation of which company i'm i

28
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:38,568
going to hire is there is a pen test so

29
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,219
i figure we'll just ask the audience

30
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:45,079
does anyone want our just give that a

31
00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:46,068
shot what what a pen test is and i guess

32
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:51,038
different people have different

33
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:51,039
definitions but for me it's basically

34
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,060
attacker

35
00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:00,939
simulation so it's not something that's

36
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:05,500
directly repeatable you're basically

37
00:02:00,939 --> 00:02:07,750
clinking behavior and creating it on the

38
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:15,220
fly given a certain situation or

39
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:17,860
scenario or network so if you have one

40
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:21,370
company and it's untested two different

41
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:24,160
ways then you may get to radically few

42
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:25,900
different results both may be breached

43
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,849
but they could end up reached in very

44
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,900
different ways and i want to point this

45
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:31,480
out because there's a common

46
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:34,269
misconception between what a pen tester

47
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,679
is and what a pen test is versus what

48
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:40,030
upon ability sin is and what a

49
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,290
vulnerability audit is and so part of

50
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:43,599
the hip points that I want to take in

51
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:46,060
this talk is if you're conducting a pen

52
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,828
test you don't want to fall into just

53
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:49,299
conducting a vulnerability assessment or

54
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:56,560
a vulnerability scanning submitting

55
00:02:49,299 --> 00:03:00,910
management and so on paper it's this

56
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:03,430
very neat tidy process yep you're you're

57
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:05,620
kick off the other recon you have your

58
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:08,680
exploitation and exfiltration and then

59
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:11,350
you have reporting and on paper it looks

60
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,840
like this very neat process but in

61
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:16,120
reality a pen test really isn't going to

62
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:20,769
be that meeting Heidi in reality it's

63
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:23,859
going to be sort of this jumble of what

64
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:25,630
can I try and get into that didn't work

65
00:03:23,859 --> 00:03:28,569
let me try this that didn't work when we

66
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:30,280
try this and this is more in line with

67
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:32,200
how an attacker works this isn't how our

68
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,730
vulnerability assessment works upon

69
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:37,450
durability assessment is just purely

70
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:41,709
automation so the difference between the

71
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:46,298
two is human intelligence and manual

72
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:48,400
testing and basically a person making

73
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:52,319
judgments about what to do next instead

74
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,319
of just pure automation

75
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:57,350
and the other thing I'd say is that a

76
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,420
pen test isn't a checklist so there's

77
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:02,299
lots of guides and frameworks out there

78
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:07,280
for conducting a pen test so things like

79
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:10,220
the ppes which was created and

80
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,470
co-founded by Dan Kennedy there's

81
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,760
standards for PCI there's there's

82
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:16,459
various different standards and those

83
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,440
are guidelines they're not they're not a

84
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:19,610
checklist you would just go down and

85
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,320
check every single one of those boxes

86
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:26,300
and say okay I did that you've got your

87
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:28,730
pen test on and so I tried to illustrate

88
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,930
that a little bit better so the big

89
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:33,980
difference between the vulnerability

90
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:35,900
assessment and a pen test is that the VA

91
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:37,970
or a probability assessment is going to

92
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,620
be metric based so you can repeat it

93
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:42,560
over and over and over again and you can

94
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:43,970
see if you're improving where you can

95
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,710
repeat a pen test over and over again

96
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:48,380
but it's narrative-based it's not

97
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:51,169
necessarily metric driven and it uses

98
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:54,320
creativity and the whole point of this

99
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:58,550
is to figure out okay with in my

100
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:00,980
environment beyond my own abilities and

101
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:04,760
what can attack or do what are they

102
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:07,210
going to try and that should always be

103
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:13,909
updating and that should always be

104
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:15,950
evolving over time so before you even

105
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:18,140
get into a pen test you probably might

106
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:20,150
start conducting internal vulnerability

107
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:22,250
and external vulnerability testing first

108
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:26,810
because that's going to identify a lot

109
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:27,640
of your your low hanging fruit and then

110
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:31,460
you want to answer some basic

111
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:33,380
prerequisite questions things like you

112
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:36,080
know what devices do I have who has

113
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:38,930
access to those devices how are these

114
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,109
the rice is being patched and you know

115
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:44,930
when did i do a vulnerability scan and

116
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:46,880
what were the results and what critical

117
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:48,830
things are open and what still need to

118
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,710
work and once you've brought to that

119
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:53,580
point then it's probably time to start

120
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:57,508
thinking about how

121
00:05:53,580 --> 00:06:01,680
pestana but there are certain situations

122
00:05:57,509 --> 00:06:04,349
where a pen test is useful even if you

123
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:08,490
haven't gotten that far particularly if

124
00:06:04,349 --> 00:06:11,639
you're trying to get buy-in from upper

125
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:13,379
management and they need that they're

126
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:15,780
not convinced that there's a need for

127
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:21,060
security or a security bot a pen test

128
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:23,039
can demonstrate impact so it can more so

129
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:26,219
than you know maybe you may be able to

130
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:28,099
do yourself nothing says we have a

131
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:31,259
security problem like a screenshot of

132
00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:34,979
CIOs mailbox or a recording of voice

133
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:41,729
conversations or photos of information

134
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:43,378
that shouldn't be public so once you get

135
00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:46,409
that far when you decide that you want

136
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:49,020
to have a pipe that's done these are

137
00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:51,719
great reasons to conduct the test so

138
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:55,620
you're going to verify what you know is

139
00:06:51,719 --> 00:06:57,180
in placing and what what you have you

140
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,099
can create that political capital that I

141
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:02,340
just talked about and then you can

142
00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:06,650
determine how responsive your

143
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:08,818
organization is to being under attack

144
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:13,068
and the other thing it helps with is

145
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:13,069
finding things you don't know about so

146
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:21,140
so there's this mike tyson quote that

147
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:23,090
everyone has a great plan until they get

148
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:25,909
punched in the face and that is

149
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:27,229
definitely true for a contest so you can

150
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:30,980
think you have absolutely everything

151
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:34,070
taken care of and then a group pentester

152
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:35,900
comes in and they creatively evaluate

153
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:37,099
everything you have and now you know

154
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,450
about attacking your system in a way

155
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,190
that you haven't even considered and

156
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:42,170
that's a great reason to convective

157
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:44,120
invest because that's going to find

158
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:47,660
things that you don't know about that go

159
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:50,080
beyond just the scope of doing the

160
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,080
basics

161
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:59,210
and so like I said nothing says that you

162
00:07:56,510 --> 00:08:00,530
have a problem like proof that there's

163
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:03,190
been a compromiser that there could have

164
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:03,190
been a compromise

165
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:12,190
so now comes time for you to choose a

166
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:14,860
phone so what should you look for if it

167
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:16,380
was me choosing to hire from these are

168
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,430
some of the things that I would look for

169
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:21,490
giving all the certifications that are

170
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:23,919
out there Oh SCP is probably the best

171
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:26,950
for demonstrating knowledge of how to

172
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:32,260
conduct a pentose i would definitely

173
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:34,390
review a sample of the firm's work you

174
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:35,919
don't want to see things like just pure

175
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:38,890
tables and pie charts I mean

176
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:41,169
infographics are great but you want to

177
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:42,460
see a narrative of how the tests are

178
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:46,240
conducted the test what they were

179
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:50,620
thinking and what drove their process to

180
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:53,710
to get where they think it were where

181
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:56,740
they got so to speak and you want to see

182
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:58,240
photos of evidence to you want to be

183
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:01,690
able to prove that you know they didn't

184
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,940
just run a scan that you know they did

185
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:08,260
some manual testing and you know there's

186
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:10,690
definitely automation and there's

187
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:12,160
definitely a place for automation in

188
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:17,650
pempus but that's not the end-all be-all

189
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:20,579
and lastly I would say you're going to

190
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:22,930
look for a professionalism so you know

191
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:25,589
there's lots of firms out there that

192
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,589
will

193
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:31,339
but while they might be talented they

194
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:34,550
don't act in a way that's professional

195
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:37,420
that you would want to have a

196
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:40,160
trustworthy person have access to

197
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:42,920
potentially sensitive and confidential

198
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,630
data so you want to have some assurance

199
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,329
that you know this company is reputable

200
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:49,550
that they're going to handle things in a

201
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:51,680
manner that's consistent with your own

202
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:53,030
standards of how you handle or how you

203
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,640
want to handle confidential information

204
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:58,160
now because it looks successful they're

205
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:00,050
going to you know they could potentially

206
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,969
walk away with the keys to the kingdom

207
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:07,459
and so you want to make sure that they

208
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:10,310
protect that information so I'm going to

209
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:13,300
jump around or jump all the way to the

210
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:16,130
end we're still gives you a report so

211
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:17,780
and we'll cover the in-between in the

212
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:19,220
second section when we talk about you

213
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:21,439
know what goes into becoming a pen

214
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:24,290
tester but so you go through this

215
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,510
process the tester for the firm conducts

216
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:30,920
the pen test and now you have this

217
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:32,870
report so what do you do with this

218
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,360
report and a lot of companies

219
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:37,580
unfortunately like okay we have our pen

220
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:41,980
test report we can file that away until

221
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:44,210
next year what what you should do is

222
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:47,300
make sure you drew and understand

223
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:50,390
everything if it's on that report that

224
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:53,109
the pen testing company or the tester

225
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:55,899
found and

226
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:59,440
use that as an opportunity to drive for

227
00:10:55,899 --> 00:11:02,019
mediation and then once you've

228
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,850
remediated everything you basically want

229
00:11:02,019 --> 00:11:05,440
to schedule a follow-up and verify that

230
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:08,740
everything is the way you think it is

231
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,899
and then periodically you want to go

232
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:14,250
through a process of repeating the test

233
00:11:10,899 --> 00:11:17,620
and seeing if there's a new attack that

234
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:19,750
maybe you haven't considered it would

235
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:22,800
apply the organization said you know

236
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,800
maybe you don't already know about

237
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:30,140
so they're going to have any questions

238
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:38,329
about hiring a pen testing company or a

239
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:41,779
fantastic but remember traditional it

240
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:46,670
really depends on the scope of the

241
00:11:41,779 --> 00:11:51,410
company a lot of companies will sell

242
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:54,430
Memphis by IP address these are

243
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:57,230
typically typically companies that are

244
00:11:54,430 --> 00:12:01,310
operating primarily based on automation

245
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:02,839
or based on scanners so depending on the

246
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:07,189
size of your organization you know

247
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:10,160
person can go from 5,000 to 20,000 to

248
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:13,700
even more depending on exactly what you

249
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:15,949
want so you could have a test on that's

250
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:19,460
just purely external so you just have

251
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:22,790
the company try and get into X number of

252
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:26,120
devices X number of applications it

253
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:29,180
could be internal you could have people

254
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:31,370
actually on the ground in prem there

255
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:33,229
could be a social engineering components

256
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:38,020
so there could be email or there could

257
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:40,550
be physical components and if you can

258
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:43,189
the wider the scope of the test the

259
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:45,020
better off you are overall and the more

260
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:48,740
so than with a chance of success that

261
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:51,740
the tester is going to have so if you're

262
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:54,170
hiring a company I would go as wide as

263
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:59,510
you possibly can because that's going to

264
00:12:54,170 --> 00:13:01,839
identify the most realistic the most

265
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:01,839
realistic

266
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:08,019
it's going to be the most realistic

267
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:08,019
annulation of an attack

268
00:13:13,329 --> 00:13:17,469
so the second part is okay so what do

269
00:13:16,089 --> 00:13:22,149
you want to do to become a cluster and

270
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:24,489
what does it has to look like so first

271
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:30,420
and foremost you really want to start

272
00:13:24,489 --> 00:13:33,129
with ethics and this is something that

273
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:34,809
many organizations don't talk about or

274
00:13:33,129 --> 00:13:36,759
many presentations don't really touch

275
00:13:34,809 --> 00:13:39,329
upon but you're going to be handling

276
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:42,369
information potentially from a company

277
00:13:39,329 --> 00:13:43,809
that's you know you aren't critical to

278
00:13:42,369 --> 00:13:45,790
their business so you want to do your

279
00:13:43,809 --> 00:13:47,259
best to protect that information and you

280
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:49,179
really don't want to talk about who

281
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:54,879
you're working for or what you found or

282
00:13:49,179 --> 00:13:56,290
what your findings on if you're with a

283
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:58,449
mature organization they're going to

284
00:13:56,290 --> 00:14:02,160
have process and procedure to store this

285
00:13:58,449 --> 00:14:05,199
information if you're with a start-up or

286
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:07,290
a fairly new organization but you need

287
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:10,479
to make sure you take due care with

288
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:13,779
storing and storing any evidence that

289
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,639
you want and lastly especially for

290
00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:17,259
organizations that fall under pci

291
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:20,649
they're required to have a pen tester

292
00:14:17,259 --> 00:14:25,509
and so it's very common to have an

293
00:14:20,649 --> 00:14:27,040
organization push you to they're

294
00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:29,709
basically going to try and push you on

295
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:35,019
whether a finding is critical what

296
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:38,169
criticality is that and it's easy to

297
00:14:35,019 --> 00:14:40,569
fall into the trap of downgrading a a

298
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:44,189
finding and I would strongly encourage

299
00:14:40,569 --> 00:14:46,689
you to not do that to not basically

300
00:14:44,189 --> 00:14:48,069
compromise the body of the report

301
00:14:46,689 --> 00:14:50,589
because it doesn't really do any good

302
00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:52,868
for you as a tester or put the

303
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:54,699
organization it basically just is one

304
00:14:52,869 --> 00:14:57,600
less thing that is off someone's plate

305
00:14:54,699 --> 00:14:57,599
that they have to remediate

306
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:04,930
so some of the things that you can do to

307
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:08,800
get involved in pen testing here's some

308
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:10,750
some quick tips for getting involved in

309
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,810
the security community so things like

310
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:16,570
planning Fe sides or publishing research

311
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:19,270
or hacking things in general things like

312
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:21,730
participating in a CTF these are all

313
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:23,290
really great ideas they build up your

314
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:25,210
skill and they also connect you with

315
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:29,920
people who do this sort of thing all the

316
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:32,040
time and last year let's say find

317
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,829
someone who's a mentor or mentor someone

318
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:37,449
these are all things in this is

319
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:40,780
relatively new i have any i don't have a

320
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:42,630
ton of experience myself but bug bounty

321
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:47,730
programs like happier one and bugcrowd

322
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:51,340
are becoming very popular will use to

323
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:53,110
build skill get involved in testing and

324
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:54,340
glue the reputation for yourself now

325
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:56,500
because you're going to have a public

326
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:58,450
profile and companies like salesforce

327
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,190
actually look at this information and

328
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:02,490
look to see okay well have you

329
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:04,930
participated in a bug bounty program and

330
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:07,450
if so what did you find and how did you

331
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:10,420
find it so these are all really group

332
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:13,510
waves to get started beyond just a

333
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:17,640
college education which is so important

334
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:17,640
but these things are really important to

335
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:28,710
that should be better

336
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:28,709
yes there we go

337
00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:37,059
and so who's out other existing

338
00:16:34,929 --> 00:16:40,920
knowledge that you can have that he is

339
00:16:37,059 --> 00:16:42,910
helpful to testing so figure that

340
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,709
whatever you're testing you need to have

341
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:46,959
some expertise on so if you're running

342
00:16:44,709 --> 00:16:49,929
the Linux systems or Windows systems or

343
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:51,550
you need to automate something these are

344
00:16:49,929 --> 00:16:55,029
things that you need to know ahead of

345
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:57,309
time so if having things like a solid

346
00:16:55,029 --> 00:17:00,579
background in networking and scripting

347
00:16:57,309 --> 00:17:02,679
in Python or Ruby or see these are all

348
00:17:00,579 --> 00:17:05,069
really good things and they're going to

349
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:11,500
make you that much more successful and

350
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:13,209
we would say also is that if you just

351
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,189
jump in the pen testing and you don't

352
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:18,309
have a solid background in what you're

353
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:20,319
testing you can give an organization a

354
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:22,449
false sense of security so you want to

355
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,709
make sure that you know if you're not

356
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:26,110
really comfortable bringing into

357
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:28,600
something or getting into a system our

358
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:30,428
understanding that system you know maybe

359
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,529
you should be climbed to work because

360
00:17:30,429 --> 00:17:34,390
it's better to define it and have

361
00:17:32,529 --> 00:17:37,600
someone who is comfortable testing those

362
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:39,760
sorts of systems then have you tested

363
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,990
not find anything and then give an

364
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,990
organizational false sense of security

365
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:51,970
so you've established your network you

366
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:54,250
have established these basic skills and

367
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:55,990
now you want to get into actually

368
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:58,960
conducting a house so I'm going to talk

369
00:17:55,990 --> 00:18:02,130
a bit about what that's like and what

370
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,130
different phases of that arm

371
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:10,720
so depending on the standard of the

372
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:12,070
framework that you're looking at there

373
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,020
could be as many as eight different

374
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:17,620
phases of a penthouse now basically

375
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:20,770
break down to having a kickoff of the

376
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:22,178
client to performing some sort of

377
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:25,510
reconnaissance whether it's social

378
00:18:22,179 --> 00:18:29,460
engineering or it's a purely a

379
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:33,190
team-based or IP address based to

380
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:37,860
attacking those systems exfiltrating the

381
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:40,450
data and then reporting on that so

382
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:42,969
there's some and I'll publish these

383
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:44,740
slides after so these are basically some

384
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:47,350
some tools that you can look at and

385
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:51,429
familiarize yourself with a head upon to

386
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:53,850
understand how they might apply to to a

387
00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:53,850
contest

388
00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:02,510
so first and foremost you're going to

389
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:05,150
have to pick up with your client and so

390
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:07,129
they're going to want to know you know

391
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:09,490
what experience you actually need to be

392
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:11,690
relatively comfortable speaking with

393
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:13,370
with the client about what you know what

394
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:15,320
you don't know and you're going to need

395
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:17,449
to ask them certain questions about what

396
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:21,200
kind of system have what their goals for

397
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:23,450
the tests on and one thing that's really

398
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,820
important is making sure that they have

399
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:28,430
proof of the IP addresses that you're

400
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:30,409
going to be testing against early in my

401
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:31,850
career I was provided a list of IP

402
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:36,880
addresses and the client didn't actually

403
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:36,879
owned them and that ended poorly for me

404
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:42,710
so it brings like physical testing you

405
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:45,649
know you wanna know do the guards have

406
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:47,870
guns are there silent alarms you know

407
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:49,400
who's watching the cameras are they you

408
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:51,800
know on Prime rather than just recording

409
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,780
do they have a third party service these

410
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:55,879
are all things that you need to know

411
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:59,720
ahead of time when you're talking about

412
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:02,330
web application testing and you talk

413
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,370
about buzzing web applications certain

414
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:06,620
forms will automatically send email so

415
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:08,330
you know you want to make sure that the

416
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:11,169
entire organization is aware that you're

417
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:13,699
testing that way if you start buzzing

418
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:16,100
some web app and someone gets flooded

419
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:18,110
with you know a whole slew of emails you

420
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:23,870
know they know who the contact to make

421
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:26,439
that stop and Roxy gets a combined

422
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:26,439
attack so

423
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:32,489
an attacker isn't just going to do a

424
00:20:29,879 --> 00:20:35,009
court stand and try and exploit the

425
00:20:32,489 --> 00:20:37,049
system they're going to try to find that

426
00:20:35,009 --> 00:20:39,299
so you know maybe they send a phishing

427
00:20:37,049 --> 00:20:42,509
email maybe the phishing email lands on

428
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:44,849
a landing page that serves up malware

429
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:46,649
maybe the malware provides you a

430
00:20:44,849 --> 00:20:48,448
foothold into their internal network and

431
00:20:46,649 --> 00:20:49,948
from there you know maybe you want to

432
00:20:48,449 --> 00:20:51,749
pip it up and you want to verify that

433
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:53,279
these attack methods are what they're

434
00:20:51,749 --> 00:20:58,459
expecting to see and that they're not

435
00:20:53,279 --> 00:21:01,249
expecting just a simple skin and lastly

436
00:20:58,459 --> 00:21:03,929
is becoming more common for

437
00:21:01,249 --> 00:21:07,109
organizations to employ third-party

438
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:09,589
vendors and cloud providers so many of

439
00:21:07,109 --> 00:21:12,749
these providers allow you to actually

440
00:21:09,589 --> 00:21:17,969
test applications in their cloud but you

441
00:21:12,749 --> 00:21:21,269
need to verify that information first so

442
00:21:17,969 --> 00:21:23,849
unless you want to set expectations so

443
00:21:21,269 --> 00:21:26,279
things like how often you're going to

444
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:29,099
communicate co-op and updates are going

445
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:32,159
to be what the reports going to contain

446
00:21:29,099 --> 00:21:34,289
and what level in detail one thing that

447
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,719
I like to provide when when I come back

448
00:21:34,289 --> 00:21:39,539
the tests are basically the full

449
00:21:36,719 --> 00:21:41,190
forensic log of everything I did when I

450
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:43,549
did it what I executed the white I

451
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:46,589
executed and basically all broad notes

452
00:21:43,549 --> 00:21:50,099
and this isn't unreasonable to ask for

453
00:21:46,589 --> 00:21:53,279
and it shows you know the thought

454
00:21:50,099 --> 00:21:55,468
process that the tester cook and it

455
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:58,940
shows how to repeat the test to verify

456
00:21:55,469 --> 00:22:02,399
that once through mediation has happened

457
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:05,299
how it's basically how to verify things

458
00:22:02,399 --> 00:22:05,299
are actually fixed

459
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:14,050
so before you start one of the things

460
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:15,250
that you're going to do is figure out

461
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:18,220
all the different tools you're going to

462
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:19,870
be touching and using and setting up the

463
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:21,880
tool in such a way that it creates lob

464
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:25,090
so if you're using a cool let metasploit

465
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:28,300
you can screw that log to you know a

466
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:30,909
certain destination if you're using

467
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:33,580
something like nichter to test a web

468
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:36,700
application you can pipe the output the

469
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:38,830
command to you know some sort of text

470
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:40,810
file and you can at least have a time

471
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:43,480
and date stamp aside from just a manual

472
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:47,919
note state of Haven and these are all

473
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:49,390
things that you want to keep and when

474
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:52,870
you get at the testing in your testing

475
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:55,750
for company it's really common to have

476
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:57,399
to stop on one test pick up on another

477
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:59,890
test and then come back to the other

478
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,300
test you know weeks later or maybe a

479
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:03,190
month later because something happened

480
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:05,800
and you had to stop so having one of

481
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:07,660
this information having solid notes with

482
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,340
date stamps and having all the output is

483
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:12,100
really important to be able to pick up

484
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:16,110
and repeat the work and basically

485
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:16,110
understand okay where exactly you work

486
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:22,450
so you establish this and how you're

487
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:24,430
going to log so you go to your first

488
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:28,510
phase of recon and so what does that

489
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:31,570
look like so the goal of rebound isn't

490
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:33,370
just to edit dns records or who is

491
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:35,980
information you basically want to

492
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:38,379
understand let their businesses what

493
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:41,140
they do what's important to this line

494
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:43,900
and from that point you want to drill a

495
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:45,710
deeper and deeper and deeper so this is

496
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:48,740
a retailer

497
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:50,570
you can make some some suggester some

498
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:52,549
assumptions about what's important so

499
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:55,850
you know if a retailer maybe they have

500
00:23:52,549 --> 00:23:57,340
credit card transactions they're

501
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:59,570
probably worried about the reputation

502
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:00,889
they probably process everything and

503
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:03,678
totally because they're processing so

504
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:08,330
many transactions defend it will assume

505
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:09,980
it's a national retail so you know maybe

506
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:12,379
you want to start on linkedin and find

507
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:14,799
IT resources and figure out who these

508
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:17,840
people are they control these systems

509
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:19,340
maybe you want to you know go through

510
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,529
their profiles figure out what systems

511
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:23,389
that have in place you know if someone

512
00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:25,580
says they work for a company a and

513
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:27,380
they're familiar in experts and

514
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:30,580
sourcefire you can probably assume that

515
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:30,580
they have a sourcefire IPS

516
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:41,250
and taking the information from these

517
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:42,929
folks you can keep it around off that

518
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:45,500
information so you can take one piece of

519
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:49,650
information about say you know IP worker

520
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:52,950
John Smith and understanding everything

521
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:54,900
about John Smith to the point where you

522
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:57,500
know maybe you want to dishonor in a

523
00:24:54,900 --> 00:25:04,590
social engineering pretext to try and

524
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:09,570
get his information so understanding the

525
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:11,370
people in detail as far as how how you

526
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:14,159
want to craft and hobby when you're

527
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:17,090
close to them is really important so

528
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:19,980
aside from just the typical you know

529
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:25,110
pivoting from dns records or who is or

530
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:29,510
SSL or IP block ownership user home unit

531
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:29,510
hand between social and technical

532
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:38,030
so we're sort of cool with the help of

533
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:39,290
automating this and you know for that

534
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:41,120
for the purpose of this presentation

535
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:43,000
we're going to just assume that you know

536
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,989
we're doing on prime internal kind of us

537
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:50,450
so through some of the tools that you

538
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:53,360
might look to understand I know so one

539
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:56,150
of the things I so love with you is it's

540
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:58,370
a one-off su and the first thing I do is

541
00:25:56,150 --> 00:26:00,050
your spy open water cert and just listen

542
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:03,620
to what's happening on the network and

543
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:09,250
just by listening to broadcasts you can

544
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:11,959
determine okay how is routing sell our

545
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:15,950
house I is the network is there a go to

546
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:21,310
1x is there what's being broadcast is

547
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:23,450
there hsrp and you can make very good

548
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:24,919
determinations about how I networks

549
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:28,810
configured just by listening without

550
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:31,550
transmitting a single patty so another

551
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:33,770
another app that's great to look at its

552
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:35,300
multi though so multi will takes one

553
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:37,550
piece of information you've plotted on a

554
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:40,129
map and it allows you to pick off that

555
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:43,700
information to other pieces and it helps

556
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:45,770
you build almost a mind map of either IP

557
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:50,720
addresses or people or social

558
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:52,070
information and multi bro is a semi paid

559
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,140
app there's paid versions and free

560
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:56,419
versions but there's open source

561
00:26:54,140 --> 00:27:00,530
solutions to like spider foot which

562
00:26:56,420 --> 00:27:02,450
basically the similar things check the

563
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:04,090
boxes of how many engines you wanna

564
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:06,800
clear if you provide a domain name and

565
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:08,510
it's basically going to provide a ton of

566
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:11,050
information select the format that you

567
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:11,050
have the mind

568
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:17,650
things like that discovery strips from

569
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:20,290
leave there are fantastic but they're

570
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:24,910
just a starting place while lyrics strip

571
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:26,440
is a great resource you don't want to

572
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:28,510
just run that script and say okay here's

573
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:30,310
my recon section of this report you want

574
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:32,200
to take that information gather the

575
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:36,190
result and then pick it off that the

576
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:37,630
boob tube lip on it and improve it and

577
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:41,740
then I first showed n is a great

578
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:45,820
resource for just looking at what's

579
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:49,690
exposed externally in an environment and

580
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:52,120
these are different screenshots of you

581
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:54,880
know these various tools so so this is

582
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:57,370
my food oh so you get an idea of what

583
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,860
that looks like so you have you know one

584
00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:03,550
device here and you can see how it has a

585
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:05,469
relationship with something else and

586
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:07,330
taking screenshots of us once you have

587
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:09,190
this and once you publish information is

588
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:10,540
going to be helpful to explain this back

589
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:12,780
to the client when you're conducting the

590
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,780
test

591
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:19,850
so here's this is a screenshot of spider

592
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:23,120
foot and you can see a very different

593
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:24,560
it's basically put over on a number of

594
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,570
checks and then it's basically gonna

595
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:28,580
dump all that data into the CSV and then

596
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:32,720
from there you need to do your own magic

597
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:35,300
and either be pull that into a database

598
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:40,940
or find a way to create that and pull

599
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:44,210
that into the report this is a fever

600
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:47,060
discovery script which is actually an

601
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:52,940
amazing pool and he's gotten this to the

602
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:55,310
point now where you can feed just an IP

603
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:57,410
range and it will go in and map and then

604
00:28:55,310 --> 00:29:02,030
peel nmap results back into medicine and

605
00:28:57,410 --> 00:29:06,050
try and run known Metasploit module is

606
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:09,940
against go ahead but then this is very

607
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:13,190
much you know script and automation so

608
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:16,220
while this mu pine low-hanging fruit you

609
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:22,250
want to verify anything that any sort of

610
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:25,970
automation bonds unless there's a

611
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:29,390
there's actually a group book by frank

612
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:31,960
at home call potted disappear and so

613
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:31,960
this is

614
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:38,750
the book we need to believe that it's

615
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:42,080
supposed to be something that you do

616
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:44,600
that might disappear but really if you

617
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,549
look at all the advices in Reverse it's

618
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:48,409
an excellent guide how to track people

619
00:29:46,549 --> 00:29:49,790
and how to pivot on different pieces of

620
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:51,559
information to figure out how something

621
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:53,840
works where they're going to be in weber

622
00:29:51,559 --> 00:30:00,100
routines are so this is one of the best

623
00:29:53,840 --> 00:30:02,809
research about Bob believe it or not so

624
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:04,428
you get past those sort of passes we

625
00:30:02,809 --> 00:30:08,389
found perceptions and now you want to go

626
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:10,340
into more I guess you'd say actively and

627
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:11,929
so you're substandard pools that you

628
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:14,629
might be on an internal or that you

629
00:30:11,929 --> 00:30:18,740
might use on an internal compass so this

630
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:21,049
is n map which is a port scan which

631
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:24,440
basically is going to give you some some

632
00:30:21,049 --> 00:30:26,900
detail of you know what's out there and

633
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:29,090
what services are exposed and what

634
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:30,410
versions of software which you know that

635
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:33,590
that's the sort of information that you

636
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:35,780
want to get the research back so

637
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:37,520
basically we're executing these tools

638
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:41,149
you're pulling banners and trying to

639
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:43,520
determine web systems are up what's

640
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:46,910
exposed what software versions are

641
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:48,740
available and you want to take that and

642
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:51,610
figure out okay given these things how

643
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:51,610
can I slogans

644
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:58,060
but into further than that given that

645
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:59,830
information that you would take that

646
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:02,169
back you go into an exploit page and try

647
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:06,429
and exploit those but depending on the

648
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:09,100
security the security maturity of the

649
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:15,760
organization there soon they're certain

650
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:17,649
I would say shortcuts that you can use

651
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:20,230
for an organization that hasn't gone

652
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:24,520
through a test before that work

653
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:26,470
extremely well so first and foremost it

654
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:28,210
no thinks they have them but most

655
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:30,580
organizations have open postures with

656
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:33,400
confidential information on it's just a

657
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:36,669
fact of effective life inductive

658
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:39,790
business for a while it just happens and

659
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:41,770
so finding those shares figuring out

660
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:43,360
what's on them and what's usable I know

661
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:45,790
my experience I've found scripts with

662
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,449
passwords up hold the main additive

663
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:50,860
creds off open file shares before

664
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:54,330
finding devices that have the call

665
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:59,199
credentials things like EPS is cameras

666
00:31:54,330 --> 00:32:01,659
nass devices are incredibly common and

667
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,160
then a lot of organizations have devices

668
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:07,870
that they swear that they can't patch

669
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:10,960
and so identifying those devices quickly

670
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:15,000
can find you a quick and easy path to

671
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,000
you basically improve the owner network

672
00:32:15,389 --> 00:32:21,089
trust with spider laps released a tool

673
00:32:18,239 --> 00:32:22,950
called responder which is fantastic and

674
00:32:21,089 --> 00:32:27,059
what responder does is it sits on a

675
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:31,289
network and response to any bios name

676
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:32,940
broadcast with a scoop response and it

677
00:32:31,289 --> 00:32:36,929
will do that for netbios it will do that

678
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:39,119
for LOL M&R and it will do that for w

679
00:32:36,929 --> 00:32:40,950
bad requests so that means that you can

680
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:43,859
get in the middle of a user in web

681
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:47,399
traffic without losing things like our

682
00:32:43,859 --> 00:32:50,699
speaker it also means it this is a very

683
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:53,458
quick and easy way to gather patches so

684
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:56,579
using a cool wet responder on a network

685
00:32:53,459 --> 00:32:59,729
that has never seen the two before it is

686
00:32:56,579 --> 00:33:02,908
a very quick and easy way to gather my

687
00:32:59,729 --> 00:33:06,209
ashes and then once you take those

688
00:33:02,909 --> 00:33:07,739
hatches crack them you can hit around

689
00:33:06,209 --> 00:33:09,739
the network fairly easily if they've

690
00:33:07,739 --> 00:33:13,259
never gone through the exercise before

691
00:33:09,739 --> 00:33:15,329
and if they have the pool was great to

692
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:18,209
verify that you know the control they

693
00:33:15,329 --> 00:33:22,320
have in place or actually work and

694
00:33:18,209 --> 00:33:24,599
lastly let's say on base Land Management

695
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:29,729
controllers for service there's a

696
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:33,149
protocol called item which is think del

697
00:33:29,729 --> 00:33:36,959
T rack or any sort of how to ban

698
00:33:33,149 --> 00:33:40,829
management have a protocol called ipmi

699
00:33:36,959 --> 00:33:43,679
and ipmi works in such a way that it was

700
00:33:40,829 --> 00:33:45,119
virgin to this where you send the

701
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,769
demands of user name it will respond

702
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:49,589
back with the hatch of the username

703
00:33:46,769 --> 00:33:51,450
password and that's by design which

704
00:33:49,589 --> 00:33:52,950
means that if you have that action then

705
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:56,570
you can potentially crack that password

706
00:33:52,950 --> 00:34:01,019
and so rapid7 did an excellent writer

707
00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:03,208
and how this in the slide that's the

708
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:05,459
researcher that initially just step with

709
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:09,359
the vulnerability so these are abusive

710
00:34:05,459 --> 00:34:10,889
shortcuts for an organization that has

711
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:13,250
already gone through is putting up a lot

712
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:13,250
of this information

713
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:21,610
you know and so for there's lots of ways

714
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:24,429
to discover open flashers the Metasploit

715
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:26,200
module is probably the best rather than

716
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:27,370
using nmap or any other tool just

717
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:32,520
because it will gather that information

718
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:34,690
quickly and dump it to a text file so

719
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:36,100
now you're in the next flip first you

720
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:40,470
find all the devices you want to xscape

721
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:43,360
them so i would say first and foremost

722
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:45,730
before i probably should have switched

723
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:47,740
out the other but probably searching for

724
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:50,800
specific attacks against certain

725
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:53,949
applications is probably going to be you

726
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:56,500
know your person foremost attacking web

727
00:34:53,949 --> 00:34:58,390
apps you need to know how to do that and

728
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:03,030
there's lots of different methods to

729
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:05,560
that a wast is a great research a

730
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:07,990
commonly overlooked method of excellent

731
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:13,120
addition is all there to protocol so

732
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:14,290
things like our band hsrp these are all

733
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:18,490
things that are typically

734
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:21,220
unauthenticated that you used to get

735
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:23,529
between a device and another device on

736
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:28,720
the network and manipulate that traffic

737
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:31,300
or gather hashes and if you have so i

738
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:33,430
would strongly encourage you to test

739
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:35,650
these flew with a head upon s them under

740
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:39,910
your home lab or but it will grab a few

741
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:42,730
happy and then you know crusing

742
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:43,129
exercises so if you never conducted a

743
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:45,039
fish

744
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:47,569
exercising don't know where to start

745
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:49,279
social dash engineer you're sad Maggie

746
00:35:47,569 --> 00:35:50,690
said is an excellent resource to start

747
00:35:49,279 --> 00:35:53,599
he's written a number of books about the

748
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:56,390
subject Kennedy has the social

749
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:58,730
engineering tool kit but there are a

750
00:35:56,390 --> 00:36:02,450
number of open source tools that will

751
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:03,980
allow you to craft a message send it to

752
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:05,990
users have the users connect back to a

753
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:09,950
landing page and then if you combine

754
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:12,319
these with other apps you can give a

755
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:14,660
group foothold into a network for a pen

756
00:36:12,319 --> 00:36:20,779
tester which is that the goal is to

757
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:23,629
basically been straight exploitation and

758
00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:25,009
so if you're building a malware package

759
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:28,190
there's even tools that all up with that

760
00:36:25,009 --> 00:36:30,079
so things like that evasion and I looked

761
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:32,329
at through WI which isn't used

762
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:34,599
specifically for building an attack

763
00:36:32,329 --> 00:36:42,259
package its use more on an internal test

764
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:44,440
for exploiting systems quickly but fails

765
00:36:42,259 --> 00:36:47,559
probably that if they go to too late now

766
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:49,809
one of the issues I ran into is that

767
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:52,549
what you think might be undetectable

768
00:36:49,809 --> 00:36:55,119
often is detectable so testing these

769
00:36:52,549 --> 00:36:55,119
things ahead of time

770
00:36:56,190 --> 00:37:02,400
they say don't but everyone does running

771
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:05,369
a sample through virustotal it's

772
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:07,560
probably a good idea ahead of time to

773
00:37:05,369 --> 00:37:09,060
understand it you're you know if you

774
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,619
said all this time crafting a social

775
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,509
engineering campaign only to have your

776
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:14,460
sample right by whatever the stamp

777
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:15,660
solution is then incredibly different

778
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:18,030
times so you want to know that the

779
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:22,230
sample is mostly undetectable before you

780
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:24,119
even really get started and then once

781
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:28,310
you explored all the systems so now you

782
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:32,220
want to excellent rate the data which

783
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:35,369
going to put so involved in the rhian

784
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:36,930
and the X living then you get to this

785
00:37:35,369 --> 00:37:42,480
part more like up in and out what I got

786
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:44,540
the main admin great so through things

787
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,500
like granting yourself access to

788
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:47,849
mailboxes that you shouldn't have access

789
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,950
to finding a non financial information

790
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:52,190
and finding it quickly this is a big

791
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:55,049
organization we need to have scripts

792
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:58,220
where we need to have a method identify

793
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:58,220
this information rather fast

794
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:09,309
and so these are just examples of you

795
00:38:03,759 --> 00:38:11,890
know a database dumps meterpreter

796
00:38:09,309 --> 00:38:14,459
sessions showing the content access the

797
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:16,538
system screenshots are awesome

798
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:20,339
especially if you have a screenshot of

799
00:38:16,539 --> 00:38:20,339
someone's desktop with the wraps open

800
00:38:21,269 --> 00:38:27,218
yeah I think you waste it up the idea so

801
00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:30,069
you've gone through you venture with all

802
00:38:27,219 --> 00:38:33,449
the data now what so now you need to

803
00:38:30,069 --> 00:38:36,939
report on this information so this is a

804
00:38:33,449 --> 00:38:39,219
pain that many investors that will be

805
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:41,558
reported to have three written parts so

806
00:38:39,219 --> 00:38:43,390
you need to have an executive summary so

807
00:38:41,559 --> 00:38:44,829
someone's we quickly understand what it

808
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:46,868
is that you found and how important or

809
00:38:44,829 --> 00:38:49,749
critical it is you need to have a

810
00:38:46,869 --> 00:38:52,869
detailed narrative with finding

811
00:38:49,749 --> 00:38:54,819
information to show whether permission

812
00:38:52,869 --> 00:38:56,829
you have or what information you found

813
00:38:54,819 --> 00:38:58,390
why it's important why it's critical

814
00:38:56,829 --> 00:39:00,909
which is where you should have things

815
00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:03,699
like your screenshots and then you have

816
00:39:00,909 --> 00:39:07,779
remediation guns so we need to have

817
00:39:03,699 --> 00:39:09,009
disease right you know found that it was

818
00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:12,219
possible to our scoop and getting

819
00:39:09,009 --> 00:39:13,569
between this traffic so you know you

820
00:39:12,219 --> 00:39:16,209
need to implement controls against

821
00:39:13,569 --> 00:39:18,308
that's only the implement dynamic our

822
00:39:16,209 --> 00:39:20,439
inspection or go to an actor you know

823
00:39:18,309 --> 00:39:23,289
whatever your guidance is Bruce into

824
00:39:20,439 --> 00:39:25,749
extra time and extra research so that's

825
00:39:23,289 --> 00:39:31,169
something that you want to basically say

826
00:39:25,749 --> 00:39:31,169
for yourself to write it or have time to

827
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:38,820
so and the next few slides are just

828
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:42,250
great downs of all these different parts

829
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:46,560
the executive summary what we did we did

830
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:50,410
it to quote methods and what conclusions

831
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:53,950
the narrative so that's basically the

832
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:57,220
media class don't forget the new

833
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:59,230
screenshots and then for every finding

834
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:01,270
you have you need any food on a fixative

835
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,890
and it doesn't you're going to be

836
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:05,620
responsible for fixing it but you need

837
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:07,540
to you know these are people who may not

838
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:10,180
understand what it is you found their

839
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:12,850
lives and put let alone how to fix it so

840
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:15,759
you could provide people for your client

841
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:20,770
guidance on how to get started in that

842
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:26,760
direction click and that's it does

843
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:26,759
anyone have any questions I bet so

844
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:39,890
yes

845
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:51,790
so when you're conducting the pen test

846
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:54,920
your your test and production systems

847
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:57,350
but when you're developing your methods

848
00:40:54,920 --> 00:41:00,050
of attack you know what put it on the

849
00:40:57,350 --> 00:41:03,950
fly you basically so a great example is

850
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:07,760
there's a there's an attack cool tool

851
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:11,029
called your Sonya and something that

852
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:14,330
consuming it does we will modify or

853
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:17,900
scoop hsrp packets which are used for

854
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:19,520
switch family so if you don't understand

855
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:22,130
what the food does or what each of sarpy

856
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:23,990
is you because drill over in the clients

857
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:26,180
network you could basically down their

858
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:27,589
whole network without ever realizing it

859
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:30,379
so that's that's really what i mean by

860
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:33,680
don't test and production I don't

861
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:35,000
develop your attacks while you're in the

862
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:38,899
midst of a fan fest you want to do that

863
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:41,660
in the lab at the end any other

864
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:43,820
questions I bet mentioned early on there

865
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:45,808
one of the ways to get started in pen

866
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:46,920
testing is to volunteer

867
00:41:45,809 --> 00:41:51,479
conference do you know many of these

868
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:54,029
