tremendous honor and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sort of a</font>

16
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:23,100
different approach I've spoken<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

before and at dozens<font color="#CCCCCC"> of other</font>

18
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,729
conferences and I'm usually known for

19
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,589
giving these deep network security talks

20
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:30,899
you try to do provocative things with

21
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,399
network programming but the keynote is

22
00:01:30,899 --> 00:01:34,170
an opportunity to sort of pull it back

23
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:36,119
and think a little bit differently about

24
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,920
what we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the theme that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

25
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:39,540
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to approach today was disrupting</font>

26
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,250
security so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

27
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,259
practical things that you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> bring back</font>

28
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,420
to your<font color="#CCCCCC"> organization's to dramatically</font>

29
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:48,360
change how you're doing security and to

30
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,159
hopefully take security up a bar before

31
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,290
we get started I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to point out that</font>

32
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've got a great community here around</font>

33
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,770
cincinnati you know looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> around I see</font>

34
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,200
all the usual suspects the guys are that

35
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,640
are at a dfi are the guys that are on

36
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,350
the organizing committee and there's

37
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,320
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of opportunities</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get involved</font>

38

and take your career to the next level

39
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,990
community is certainly at the heart of

40
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,959
anything that we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

41
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:12,000
talking about disrupting security today

42
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,709
throughout the conference<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would ask</font>

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,080
that you try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> support all the speakers</font>

44
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:17,700
and do your<font color="#CCCCCC"> best to tweet out anything</font>

45
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,650
interesting that they're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

46
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:22,380
introduce yourself give them a follow on

52
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,810
we're incredibly passionate about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

53
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,880
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing and we love to find</font>

54
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:38,360
additional people to help out and work

55
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,359
in security

56
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,989
so I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how many people are</font>

57
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:46,059
aware of the of the proud of history

58
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:49,900
that Cincinnati actually plays in

59
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:51,939
network de vents there's more sensors

60
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:54,879
run out of Cincinnati than out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of any</font>

61
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:58,540
other place on the planet and I mean for

62
00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:01,420
need for Gordon anywhere cincinnati has

63
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:03,400
this great history<font color="#CCCCCC"> of leading network</font>

64
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:05,230
security monitor you know developing new

65
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,190
tactics new techniques and if you look

66
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,319
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the companies that are out of</font>

67
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:11,129
Cincinnati a critical stack is mine

68
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,839

<font color="#E5E5E5">to start out by pointing out is that</font>

74
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:27,369
Cincinnati taps all the things I'll try

75
00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:29,409
to give you a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> hint maybe you know</font>

84
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:53,769
for pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> my entire career here</font>

85
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:55,390
skip around a bit minor technical

86
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:57,460
difficulties

87
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:59,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm really passionate about network</font>

88
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:01,810
security and some of the things I've

89
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:03,760
done in the past were doing the bro team

90
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:06,040
at a very critical time and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

91
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,140
projects that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i took on rebranding the</font>

bro i was<font color="#E5E5E5"> called broidy yes at the time</font>

00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:12,160
as the bro platform going out to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:14,020
community teaching a lot of classes

which<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still do today was in Boston</font>

00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:19,329
yesterday teaching a workshop on bro and

97
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,459
even even bought bro org from a

98
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:23,980
fraternity which<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost I think ten</font>

99
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:26,200
thousand dollars to get that over but i

100
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:28,480
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely worth it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

101
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,909
actually was educated here in Cincinnati

102
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,560
I not only got my CS degree at Xavier

103
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:35,500
University but I also<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a network</font>

104
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,880
administrator there for four years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

105
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,340
after that I've pretty much exclusively

106
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,040
worked at startups as was mentioned

107
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:44,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">earlier this is my current gig critical</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">we're we've got some pretty big results</font>

110
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:50,380
the biggest public product that we have

111
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,419
is our probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> Intel marketplace it</font>

112
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:54,159
lets you you know build dynamically

113
00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:55,719
build collections of security Intel and

114

stream it into<font color="#E5E5E5"> your organization very</font>

116
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,200
this point and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm very proud to</font>

117
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">announce that we were just acquired by</font>

118
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,400
Capital One Bank which is an acquisition

119

<font color="#E5E5E5">that I don't think anybody saw coming us</font>

120
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,450
included but we're really excited about

121
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,190
what that's going to let us do as far as

122
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:14,919
disrupting security goes over the next

123
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:16,240
few years you know in joining all these

124
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:18,159
startups there's there's something about

125
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,890
people that go into startups there's a

126
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,169
little bit of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know being exhilarated</font>

127
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:25,060
you know being excited a little bit

128
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:27,190
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit crazy assertive SAR</font>

129
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:28,210
very hard place to go but the one thing

130
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,530
you all have in common is that you're

131
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,729
hopeful you're hopeful that you can

132
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:33,190
actually change things for the better

133
00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:35,620
that you can disrupt things and when you

134
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">look at the DNA behind startups there's</font>

135
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,070
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I think we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> learn from</font>

136
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:41,080
and bring back to your organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

137
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:42,700
if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not in a start-up today people</font>

138
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,229
are motivated by all different kinds of

139
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,400
reasons when I look around now I know

140
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:47,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">that there are people in this room</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world there's some people</font>

145
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,410
that are just looking for the glory and

146
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,760
some people are<font color="#CCCCCC"> just looking to get paid</font>

147
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:59,140
I've got a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad news for the last</font>

148
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,510
crowd you know if you're out here

149
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:03,550
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> security is hot and security is</font>

150
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:04,780
a great way to make you know fast buck I

151
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:07,030
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

152
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:09,219
successful now that being<font color="#E5E5E5"> said you're</font>

153
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:10,419
here on Saturday so I'm pretty calm

154
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:11,830
evident that we're all kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cut from</font>

155
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,000
the same cloth here you know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

156
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,340
driven by something a little bit

157
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,480
different beyond the typical reasons you

158
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:18,039
know that we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that shared sort of</font>

159
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,510
passion if you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the passion</font>

160
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,160
for what you're working on you're

161
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:23,860
definitely not going to find success

162
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:26,020
because passion is what drives you

163
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:28,180
through the hardest moments it when

164
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:29,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">things are really difficult and to</font>

00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,850
advance your career you need to

166
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:32,619
deliberately find where you're

167
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:34,420
comfortable you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the ocean and</font>

168

to make you fight and elevate your

171

173
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:45,430
amazing things when I think about you

know colon<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cain and mike reeves and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">guys you know the thing that everybody</font>

177
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,910
has in common is that they're incredibly

178
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:53,440
passionate about what they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing they</font>

179
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:54,880
wake up and they think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it they</font>

180
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,170
come in on Saturday they think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it</font>

181
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,800
they plan it for weeks and weeks and

182
00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:03,100
weeks let me take you back a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

183
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:05,590
so 1995 I was a 17 year old college

184
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,850
freshman at Xavier I had<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually been</font>

185
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,950
hired by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> University somewhat</font>

186
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:11,230
unexpectedly and worked 40 hours a week

187
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:12,760
it was a it was a crazy time for me<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

188
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:15,490
I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just starting to experiment with a</font>

189
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:17,710
big network ID<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6,000</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> workstations to</font>

190
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:19,180
play with ending I was responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

191
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,950
deploying all the software across the

192
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:22,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">university and you know we're</font>

193
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:24,159
experimenting with different ports and

194
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,260
protocols you know you kind of call what

195
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,310
we were doing then DevOps today but

196
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're what just wasn't a name for it</font>

197
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:30,370
then it was just administrators right

198
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:32,620
every administrator you know knew how to

199
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:34,810
script and knew how to do how to do

200
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:38,590
things and I'll never<font color="#E5E5E5"> really forget as a</font>

201
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:40,960
Gary here gary was my<font color="#CCCCCC"> adviser at Xavier</font>

202
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:42,549
and he's great<font color="#CCCCCC"> guy still over there now</font>

203
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,530
I'll never<font color="#E5E5E5"> really forget the first</font>

204
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:47,110
exploit that I had the opportunity<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

205
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:49,359
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> on at Xavier it was a really</font>

206
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:51,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">trivial one but the exhilarating feeling</font>

207
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,630
that I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> from working with that was</font>

208
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,919
amazing and now that the statute of

209
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:56,830
limitations is over i'll tell you the

210
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:59,169
story so as an employee of the

211
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:01,030
University I did have responsibility for

212
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:02,680
testing you there was no<font color="#CCCCCC"> pen testing</font>

213
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:04,780
category and there is this new

214
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:07,450
vulnerability that had been you know

215
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:08,979
circling around on<font color="#E5E5E5"> usenet and on some of</font>

216
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:10,539
the you know network you're early

217
00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:12,849
network security list and it was the

218
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:14,110
ping of death and like any you know

219
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:15,729
young inexperienced network

220
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:18,370
administrator I wanted to test it on my

221
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:21,760
live production environment and of

222
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:23,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">course when I ping wwh co-ed you are</font>

223
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">brand new IBM</font>

224
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:28,569

00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:31,180
come back up IBM dispatched engineers

226
00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:32,560
they replace processors it was it just

227
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,969
kept getting worse and worse<font color="#E5E5E5"> and worse</font>

228
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,468
finally they just swapped out the whole

box<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know this was like our brand new</font>

00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:43,089

00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:45,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">uh the first thing I learned is to keep</font>

233
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:47,920
my mouth shut right<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that was a good</font>

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing that I learned is that you know</font>

236
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:55,060
you need to be more careful and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it went</font>

237
00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:56,560
a lot longer from then<font color="#E5E5E5"> until recently</font>

238
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,479
before I crashed another system

239
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,410
accidentally without permission but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

240
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,910
wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really my fault that was</font>

243
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:06,010
have to wait wait a few years to hear

learned and figured<font color="#E5E5E5"> out about myself was</font>

what was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> driving me forward and</font>

it you know sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of become my personal</font>

248
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:16,570
mission statement it's that I really

249
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:18,730
like to work on hard problems in that

250
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:20,529
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know to find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something that is</font>

00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:22,329
important and very<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult something</font>

00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:23,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I almost feel is bigger than me</font>

around you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> water is a little</font>

bit deeper<font color="#CCCCCC"> than I'm comfortable and</font>

experience that and when you're when

00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:35,800
you're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the hard problems</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

matter but<font color="#E5E5E5"> none more so than defense</font>

00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,160
right you know the defense<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

264
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,360
network is a really intractable and a

265
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,010
hard problem that's what that's what

266
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,329
brings<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to that and that's that's the</font>

00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:50,800
sort of perspective that I've had<font color="#CCCCCC"> in my</font>

268
00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:51,849
career and that's what I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk</font>

269
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,680
about we think about changing your

270
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:55,209
organization for better there's lots of

271
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,430
ways to do that I'm not dog in pen

272
00:09:55,209 --> 00:09:58,630
testers<font color="#CCCCCC"> or red team but frankly if it</font>

273
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,699
were just<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking down networks are</font>

274
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:03,310
breaking in I would get bored because

275
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:05,709
it's too easy right a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> really hard</font>

276
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:07,709
problem that matters is trying to defend

277
00:10:05,709 --> 00:10:10,029
a network because you don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

278
00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:11,890
you know you can be wrong once and you

279
00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:14,680
lose you know on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other side of the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">table you can be wrong 99.99 percent of</font>

281
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,519
the time and still win right the odds

282
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:21,670
just aren't in our favor when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

283
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:23,709
network defenders you know spending all

284
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:25,120
this time in and around startups you

285
00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:26,680
know you sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out you know</font>

286
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,480
what's the difference between the

287
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,939
startup mentality the startup outlook

288
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,470
and operating a business you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

289
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:34,779
inside an organization where you might

00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:36,579
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> now you know maybe you are a student</font>

291
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:37,000
or you work in information systems or

292
00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:38,859
you've got

293
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,840
sponsibility for compliance we probably

294
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,980
have responsibility for 50 things you

295
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:45,190
know too many things on your on your

296
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:47,020
head startups have this luxury of sort

297
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:48,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">of understanding that you're in a search</font>

298
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:50,949
for a repeatable scalable business model

299
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:52,360
right that<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything that you think you</font>

300
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:54,100
know is just<font color="#CCCCCC"> an assumption until you</font>

301
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,600
test it when you turn over another<font color="#E5E5E5"> rock</font>

302
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,040
even if there's nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> under there</font>

303
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,390
that's a win because that's another

304
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,849
technique that doesn't work and good

305
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:02,740
startups are pivoting and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:05,170
moving forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they align their</font>

307
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,520
development practices with those sorts

308
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:07,959
of techniques if you're familiar with

309
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,520
like agile you know you do your daily

310
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,740
scrum and everybody comes in and you say

311
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:13,210
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do the last 24 hours well I</font>

312
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:15,100
failed on this and this was a blocker

313
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:16,570
what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do the next 24 hours</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

314
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,670
going to try to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and here's the</font>

315
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:20,320
resources I need and and that those

316
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:21,760
those opportunities that you're

317
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">collecting data that's an opportunity</font>

318
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">for you to refine your strategy as</font>

319
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:29,050
you're moving through the pursuit to

320
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:31,959
your goals and organizations that adopt

321
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:34,420
those very fast agile practices attend

322
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,950
to succeed faster and better because

323
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:38,170
instead of batching up you know 200

324
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:39,490
changes into one big release and

325
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,959
assuming hey we know what's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you</font>

326
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:43,870
know what's going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let's</font>

put<font color="#CCCCCC"> our change out there are fix that's</font>

328
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:47,920
a recipe for failure because you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort</font>

329
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:49,719
of putting 200 assumptions all together

330
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,670
in there and this is when you see

331
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,680
organizations that are releasing you

332
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:55,180
know 10 12 times a day adopting that

kind of mentality on your security<font color="#E5E5E5"> team</font>

00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,880
your organization and and those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

336
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,640
real two elements that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to start</font>

337
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:06,600
with here we have these hard problems

338
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:10,150
that matter in security and we also have

339
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:12,520
the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of start up mentality of the</font>

340
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:14,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">search for a repeatable scalable process</font>

341
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:17,050
you know how do we put those two things

342
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:19,210
together<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a way that can help you to</font>

343
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:22,589
dramatically change the security of your

344
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:26,710

00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:28,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying why is security hard then we're</font>

346
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:30,130
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the problem in</font>

347
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:32,589
its face and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to look at some</font>

348
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:34,300
particular examples then we're going to

349
00:12:32,589 --> 00:12:36,580
get to what I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the media to talk</font>

350
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,990
today and that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really the disruptive</font>

351
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:40,120
strategy for secured in your

352
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:42,220
organization and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of a set of</font>

353
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:45,160
templates and a few techniques that you

354
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:47,770
can use to<font color="#E5E5E5"> manipulate your peers at work</font>

355
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,959
as a true social engineer to move your

356
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:50,529
security organization forward and then

357
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:52,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the end</font>

358
00:12:50,529 --> 00:12:54,579
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a quick peek at some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> NSM</font>

359

tools that you can use if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not</font>

360
00:12:54,579 --> 00:12:58,089
using you should be using to try to

00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:59,199
drive<font color="#CCCCCC"> your organization for it and I'll</font>

365
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:07,329
crux of the problem here you know the

366
00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:09,249
crux of the problem and security is this

367
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:11,949
time to exploitation when you're you're

368
00:13:09,249 --> 00:13:14,800
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at an attacker an attacker can</font>

369
00:13:11,949 --> 00:13:18,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">take a new exploit you know heartbleed</font>

370
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:20,349
or bash bash bug and within 24 to 48

371
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:22,509
hours have it weaponized and exploiting

372
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:24,249
around your network if you compare<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

373
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:26,769
to you know this sort of traditional

374
00:13:24,249 --> 00:13:29,730
security process by which you<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to</font>

375
00:13:26,769 --> 00:13:31,990
identify deploy and secure new

capabilities it's a complete and total

377
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:36,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">mismatch it's a losing game because most</font>

378
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:38,559
organizations just aren't equipped to

379
00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:41,050
move quickly enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you're</font>

380
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:42,730
following<font color="#CCCCCC"> the the move that cincinnati</font>

network security monitoring or NSM

383
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:49,149
stacks the idea behind those stacks is

384
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:52,180
that collections of<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source tools</font>

385
00:13:49,149 --> 00:13:53,649
can be used to be customized very

386
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:55,809
quickly to target emerging

387
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:58,720
vulnerabilities such as heart bleed and

388
00:13:55,809 --> 00:14:00,839
bash bug but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> still have this this</font>

389
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,850
attention that defenders are fragile

390
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:06,129
while attackers are very agile right

391
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:07,990
it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> difference between what they</font>

392
00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:11,290
can do versus what we can do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

393
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:14,800
defenders the second reason that defense

394
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:16,089
is incredibly hard is the things that

395
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">really matter in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this country</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

403
00:14:33,129 --> 00:14:36,879
typically outdated by the time they go

404
00:14:35,139 --> 00:14:38,139
into operations and when you when you're

405
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:39,639
running these and operating these

those sorts of solutions with the most

important reason that security is really

wrong side of math when you when you

427
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,910
when you think about the ratio of

alert me that something's different I

might have network forensics because it

other types of devices we're already

00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:01,750
handicapped from the start we have

those are reasons why security continues

00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:20,199
to get harder

482
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:22,539
every day and and to realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:30,668
the problem that you're in so the

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,889
challenge that that you have as security

488

continue to refine and get that get

493
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:44,769
better it's that growing device

management gap you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know being on that</font>

495
00:17:44,769 --> 00:17:48,190
wrong side of math so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at some</font>

00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:50,110
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that that i found on the</font>

00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:51,850
internet just just quickly as a survey

498
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:53,260
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so this is a light switch</font>

in<font color="#E5E5E5"> switzerland you know sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of like</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">they're growing but there's a grow lab</font>

504
00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:09,360
on the internet here is a like a

507
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:17,139
these things<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the Internet convenience</font>

508
00:18:15,399 --> 00:18:19,389
you know always blending you know that

509
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:21,519
convenient versus security there's going

510
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:24,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">to have to be a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give and take</font>

00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:27,639
between those two competing tensions

especially in security another home

513
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:31,090
automation system in Spain and if you

514
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:34,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">look you have access to the intrusion</font>

516
00:18:34,389 --> 00:18:40,928
probably puts a put star trek on TV or

517
00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:43,720
something like that a developer working

up at a university in new york<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font>

519
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:51,279
wonder what licenses code is under right

00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:53,529
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> free I waste a waste treatment</font>

521
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:55,160

<font color="#CCCCCC">internet</font>

523

524
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:02,300
are contrived these are all actual

things that are now connected whenever

00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:06,020
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> find something that shouldn't be</font>

527
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,850
connected to the internet just realize

528
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:09,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">that if there's one there's probably</font>

529
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:11,570
about 10,000 more that are also

530
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:13,520
connected to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet and that goes</font>

waste treatment plants that goes for

533
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:20,719
grow labs that goes for anything here is

534
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:22,460
a square image with quote that I didn't

535
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,190
put the name on and I don't know what

536
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:27,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is oh this is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worst one this is</font>

537
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:28,730
a pig farm right and if you I've checked

538
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,930
out on them a couple times I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

539
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:32,270
why I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> emotionally attached</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

540
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:33,830
these guys and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> partly because you</font>

541
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:36,020
can feed them so I kind of feel like

542
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:37,639
it's a little virtual pet I'm not

543
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,870
feeding them I'm not clicking on the

544
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,240
things right I learned my lesson the

545
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:42,620
hard way but the sad part is is that you

546
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,600
can watch the numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> go up and down</font>

547
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:48,560
right so you're this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> bacon on the</font>

the works going on there that's that's

intense a license-plate scanner and you

567
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:37,100
can actually watch the licenses go by

568

I'm kind of glad it is and I was curious

581
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:15,210
I was like maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is like a model</font>

617
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:09,380
bad things right he's got a little

619
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:13,309
new york data center it must not be very

620
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:15,770
sophisticated because he actually his VN

621
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:17,809
seed into the console and left VNC

622
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:19,158
unlocked and you see him here he's like

623
00:23:17,809 --> 00:23:20,690
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at credit card numbers</font>

00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:23,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">that he's you know popping off somewhere</font>

625
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:26,600
so not it not necessarily good thing

626
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:28,460
right so it's a huge<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem and it's</font>

627
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,139
it's a the problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting worse right</font>

628
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:32,510
more of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things are going online</font>

629
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:35,899
every day and many of them are with us

630
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:38,419
for a long time as capital assets so

631
00:23:35,899 --> 00:23:40,729
let's talk about security strategy and

632
00:23:38,419 --> 00:23:42,169
this is where you as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

00:23:42,169 --> 00:23:46,159

effectively and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

00:23:49,909 --> 00:23:54,380
organizing better organizing and

639
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:59,178
executing better you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about how</font>

most organizations are set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in my</font>

career I've had the great pleasure to

642
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:05,510
work and consult to some of the leading

643
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:07,399
organizations in the United States in

about<font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty plus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years I've been a</font>

648
00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:20,600
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a lot of luck and I've seen the</font>

649
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:22,789
same sort of fail patterns over and over

650
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,590
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is what I would kind of</font>

651
00:24:22,789 --> 00:24:25,940
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most common one and I don't know</font>

652
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:27,080
where you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this room you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

653
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:29,179
you're passionate about securities

654
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:31,039
you're probably down in this area you

655
00:24:29,179 --> 00:24:32,360
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're these people appear or less</font>

656
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,920
passionate about security I would be

657
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,510
shocked if we had a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people from</font>

658
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:38,090
there and maybe you're even a vendor

659
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:40,690
down in this area here but the typical

660
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:42,649
budgetary request cycle is is that

661
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:44,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're putting together your wish list</font>

662
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:47,480
and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> sending it up and they're</font>

663
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:48,920
rubber stamping no or yes on everything

664
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,600
else and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your budget and</font>

665
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:52,850
you get with vendors and you select it

666
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,139
and the problem with that is is that

667
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:57,049
you're not investing your entire

668
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:58,520
organization into security when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look</font>

at<font color="#E5E5E5"> even my personal story you know</font>

670
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:02,600
critical stack my company was just

671
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,730
acquired by a bank right there's this

672
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,649
growing<font color="#E5E5E5"> realization right now across all</font>

677
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:18,020
everybody is sort of realizing now and

it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the military its financials</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

679
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:22,040
industrials that technology needs to be

680
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,309
a core part of our business and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

681
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:27,730
starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see boards of directors</font>

682
00:25:24,309 --> 00:25:29,780
prioritize and fund security initiatives

683
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:31,940
information system initiatives because

684
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:33,830
they see the big gains that can be

685
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:36,080
achieved by organizations that can

686
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:38,480
master those sorts of tools and

687
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">techniques and in that lies a tremendous</font>

688
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:44,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">opportunity for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you to take a leadership</font>

689
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:47,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">role by teaching your organization how</font>

690
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:49,730
to implement security correctly so let's

691
00:25:47,299 --> 00:25:52,790
put forward a basic security strategy

692
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:54,260
and this is a very heavily influenced by

693
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:55,820
the work of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Richard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> balak if you're</font>

694
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:57,799
familiar with them one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the absolute</font>

695
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:59,990
leaders by all of his books read his

696
00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:01,970
blog follow him on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter an absolute</font>

697
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:05,840
great guy and one of the real fathers of

698
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:08,030
network security monitoring and I had

699
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:11,600
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> opportunity to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work with a number of</font>

700
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:14,210
military organizations and this was<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort</font>

701
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:16,159
of the like campaign model of security

702
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:18,470
that we came<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with and the the first</font>

703
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:20,690
step is to you know sort of recognize

704
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:22,970
that in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this modern security paradigm</font>

705
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:24,770
you know you know people need to realize

706
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:26,750
and it's they are realizing even at the

707
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:29,240
board level that prevention is dead

708
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:33,410
right and that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of new goal in</font>

709
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:35,720
security is not to prevent<font color="#CCCCCC"> compromise</font>

710
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:37,700
because it's not possible it's certainly

711
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,919
important to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to prevent compromise</font>

712
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:42,350
but if you don't recognize that

713
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:45,080
compromise is inevitable you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

714
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:46,100
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fail so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> teaching</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your board of</font>

715
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,570
directors you know

716
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:51,199
say the one level mission statement of

717
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:52,549
our organization needs to become we need

718
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,049
to minimize the risk of loss to

719
00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:55,730
intrusion because right there we're

720
00:26:54,049 --> 00:26:57,289
already recognizing at the top at the

721
00:26:55,730 --> 00:27:00,230
funding level at the prioritization

722
00:26:57,289 --> 00:27:01,970
level that we're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be compromised</font>

723
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:03,710
and what that does then is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> flows</font>

724
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:05,780
down through our security organization

725
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:07,880
that's going to change the metrics that

726
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:10,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">you are that you can use to present to</font>

727
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:13,429
your peers or how you are evaluated for

728
00:27:10,789 --> 00:27:17,090
criteria of success or failure and we'll

729
00:27:13,429 --> 00:27:19,010
move into<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in just a moment there's</font>

730
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:20,720
also this one weird trick let's see

731
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:22,250
Cincinnati father discovers this one

732
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,870
weird trick to manipulate boards of

733
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:25,760
directors click here to find out<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

734
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:28,070
right and this is the one weird trick

735
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:30,530
that i'll give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you that will make you</font>

736
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:33,950
taller happily more happily married more

737
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:36,889
attractive<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the things and that is to</font>

738
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:39,110
do this in such a way that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

739
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:41,539
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is their idea you know walk like</font>

740
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:44,240
lay the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bread crumbs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to lead your bosses</font>

741
00:27:41,539 --> 00:27:45,740
to this statement our goal is to

742
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:49,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">minimize the risk of loss due to</font>

743
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:51,650
intrusion right if you it's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

744
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:54,320
depend on people but<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting somebody</font>

745
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:56,120
that has funding authority to say that

746
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,770
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is our new goal is the sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of key</font>

747
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:59,360
to unlock your success because you can

748
00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:01,100
bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that all of your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> requests</font>

749
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,479
back to them and say hey you set the

750
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:04,549
strategy right you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're the boss</font>

751
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> telling</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that my goal</font>

752
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:07,580
is to minimize the risk of loss due to

753
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,539
intrusion and let's look at how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

754
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:11,809
will flow down into your organization

755
00:28:08,539 --> 00:28:13,970
then so the board<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the CEO that are</font>

756
00:28:11,809 --> 00:28:15,440
agreeing across these program goals and

757
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:17,570
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say that our focus is</font>

758
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:21,320
to minimize the risk of loss to to

759
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:23,720
intrusion and as a CEO<font color="#CCCCCC"> CIO you sort of</font>

760
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:25,549
get to set the high-level strategy for

761
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:28,429
how that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen and you get</font>

762
00:28:25,549 --> 00:28:31,610
to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that hey analytically we're going</font>

763
00:28:28,429 --> 00:28:33,260
to try to do rapid detection now that's

764
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:35,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">the one thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I want I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to report on</font>

765
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:37,429
you know how quickly what was the dwell

766
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:39,110
time that organizations had a threat

767
00:28:37,429 --> 00:28:40,460
actor<font color="#CCCCCC"> hat inside my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> environment you know</font>

768
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:41,959
that should be known that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the heads-up</font>

769
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:43,309
report<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's going to them for every</font>

770
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,289
incident that we found how long were

771
00:28:43,309 --> 00:28:48,230
they there how quickly do we move from

772
00:28:45,289 --> 00:28:50,270
identifying a candidate incident d

773
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:52,400
validating<font color="#E5E5E5"> it as you know true positive</font>

774
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:54,530
false positive or how quickly do we take

775
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,669
a false negative you know problem we

776
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:57,678
didn't know we have how quickly do we

777
00:28:55,669 --> 00:28:59,420
turn that into it you're positive how do

778
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">we take those analytics and</font>

779
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:03,740
towards a response<font color="#E5E5E5"> and containment and</font>

780
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:05,420
that goal is aligned with this this

781
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:07,910
focus to minimize the risk of loss due

782
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:09,440
to intrusion<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then with the sizzle</font>

783
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:11,930
levels you move down and I know there's

784
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,570
at least a couple scissors here you're

785
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:16,760
you then become you know the campaign

786
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:19,250
operator you know you get to decide<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

787
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:21,590
hey we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to match and hunt for</font>

788
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:23,990
particular intruders I'm in<font color="#CCCCCC"> health care</font>

789
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:25,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">and these are the types of organizations</font>

790
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:27,740
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are attacking me right now I'm in</font>

791
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:31,250
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dib the defense industrial base and</font>

792
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:33,020
apt 29 and a PG 28 are my big threats

793
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:35,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay that's great well let's start with</font>

794
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:36,410
the reports and let's identify here's

795
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:38,270
the threat actors that we know are

796
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:40,670
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> after us here's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the tools that</font>

797
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:43,670
they're using these tools have these

798
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:45,620
capabilities you know this tool does<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS</font>

799
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:47,720
base to exfiltration right so the

800
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:49,939
hunting and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> matching becomes</font>

801
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:52,130
identifying their tools and then lining

802
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:53,840
it up with the tool of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

803
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:56,240
detect that sort of behavior all right

804
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:59,240
this is operating a campaign so you lead

805
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:01,370
your organization on on hunting trips if

806
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:06,020
you will out looking for these<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorts of</font>

807
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:07,610
advanced threat actors so then we get

808
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:09,320
down to<font color="#E5E5E5"> where I think you know I</font>

809
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:11,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">traditionally worked a lot where I think</font>

810
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:14,750
most of us are in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> room</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know now</font>

811
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:18,050
as my security staff I get to come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

812
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:20,780
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tools that I need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to meet those</font>

813
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:23,960
leadership criteria that are in<font color="#CCCCCC"> line</font>

814
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:27,080
with the strategies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that have been set</font>

815
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:28,850
by my<font color="#E5E5E5"> boss that all mapped to this</font>

816
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:30,350
ultimate organizational goal of

817
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:33,169
minimizing the risk of loss to do

818
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:35,209
intrusion so doubt it down to my level I

819
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:37,640
you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sock you know or the</font>

820
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:38,530
sick or the cert or the you know

821
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:41,750
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to call yourself</font>

822
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:43,220
you know you get to now say well to

823
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:45,050
match and hunt for those sorts of

824
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:46,610
intruders<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need to collect this type of</font>

825
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:48,800
metadata you know I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to collect all</font>

826
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:51,469
the PDFs or I<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to collect all the</font>

827
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:54,649
dns and you can now justify those those

828
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:56,990
requests on up through the food chain in

829
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:58,940
order to escalate and resolve incidents

830
00:30:56,990 --> 00:31:00,680
and finally then if you're a vendor you

831
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:03,530
know you now have an appropriate place

832
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:05,420
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the organization as as lining</font>

833
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:12,260
yourself up to what can I hunt and match

834
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:13,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">for in my org questions no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font>

835
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:14,690
let's talk about

836
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:16,550
some of the tools that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can use and</font>

837
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:19,610
how we would sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of line these tools up</font>

838
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:21,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">to different classes of metadata i could</font>

839
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:22,729
probably not go an entire talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

840
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably only said bro two or three</font>

841
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:26,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">times i think my average per talk is</font>

842
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:27,890
probably bout<font color="#CCCCCC"> forty or fifty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will be</font>

843
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,110
under under my average but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll still</font>

844
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:31,580
will still go there and<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

845
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:33,080
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the different types of metadata</font>

846
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:35,389
that we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be collecting here</font>

847
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:37,370
you know you're thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about your</font>

848
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:38,960
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you're going to be</font>

849
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:40,939
monitoring collecting all different

850
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,260
types of metadata and these metadata has

851
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:44,150
different properties and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's from</font>

852
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:46,340
different tools so think at the bottom

853
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:49,610
level you have full pcap so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

854
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:51,199
the full flows you know symmetrical so

855
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:53,870
you have both sides of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a conversation</font>

856
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you you'll always</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to be</font>

857
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:56,600
collecting that because there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a lot</font>

858
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:59,480
of incidents that you can only resolve

859
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:01,790
through a pivot down to full pcap as we

860
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,960
move up based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> size there are certain</font>

861
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:03,830
files that you probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be</font>

862
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,500
collecting whether you're just

863
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:09,560
extracting the executables or the pdfs

864
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:13,460
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> excel office files that come in</font>

865
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:16,429
via email or perhaps it's a backup files

866
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:17,150
or you know powershell scripts those are

867
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:20,440
things that you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to want to</font>

868
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:23,480
collect protocol logs so think like bro

869
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:25,340
output and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i brought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a bunch of a bro</font>

870
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:27,140
cheat sheets i'll pass<font color="#E5E5E5"> these out after</font>

871
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:30,230
my talk if people would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like them is</font>

872
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:32,930
just laminated copies of the default<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

873
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:35,150
broke protocol logs derived metadata

874
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:37,190
logs where you're taking you know this

875
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:38,690
data here and you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> performing an</font>

876
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:41,480
analysis on it and you're making new

877
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:47,690
metadata out of your original data right

878
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:51,170
so think about say extracting in every

879
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:52,880
time you have a TLS handshake the the

880
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:56,210
partner so the server will hand down

881
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:59,150
x.509 certificates and the client will

882
00:32:56,210 --> 00:33:01,250
pass up a list of ciphers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I support</font>

883
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:03,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">and an order that they're supported in</font>

884
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:05,180
and when you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything you know</font>

885
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:06,889
dumping you a list like that it becomes

886
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:09,260
a very handy little fingerprint maybe

887
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:12,320
you want to collect<font color="#E5E5E5"> over time and model</font>

888
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:14,690
what are the cipher fingerprints that we

889
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,550
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> in our organization it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very easy</font>

890
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:18,800
I've done this<font color="#E5E5E5"> on organizations you'll</font>

891
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:21,020
see you know things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you map to</font>

892
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:22,760
Firefox things that you map to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ie things</font>

893
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:25,700
that you mapped chrome and then you see

894
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:27,140
a TLS handshake so it's you know TLS on

895
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:29,870
443 it's open on

896
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:31,370
the firewall I'm not intercepting it the

897
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:33,949
certs may not tell you anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

898
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:35,449
it's a self self signed cert but you can

899
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:37,400
see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has like a single</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cipher</font>

900
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:39,740
that's supported in there now those are

901
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:43,070
great little places that you can derive

902
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:45,410
metadata to support your analysis in

903
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:46,939
your organizational goals and finally

904
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:50,720
there's alerts you know this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

905
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:53,330
0 1 percent I saw something bad this

<font color="#E5E5E5">person connected to a Zeus tracker is</font>

907
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:57,169
that a true positive or false positive

908
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:59,030
right let's pivot down to our protocol

909
00:33:57,170 --> 00:34:00,680
logs and answer that question maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

910
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:03,290
can tell maybe we can maybe we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

911
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:05,810
then go to full pcap extract files and

912
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:07,879
move from there so when we're thinking

913
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:09,529
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> driving our way through that</font>

914
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:12,260
metadata there's some properties of that

00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:14,570
metadata<font color="#CCCCCC"> that just at a high level you</font>

927
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:39,530
as you go along you know that works out

00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:41,060
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be one hundred percent of your data</font>

929
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:42,679
and when you're looking at what I'm

930
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:45,230
collecting you're going to be collecting

931

that's available in your environment is

933
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:49,610
you're going to collect full pcap and

934
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,520
then you're going to collect protocol

935
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:54,409
logs and then derived metadata possibly

936
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:56,179
files you're collecting the data in

00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:13,009
know zip you know mal office doc scanner

945
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:15,799
you know variety of other<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools to then</font>

946
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:17,450
do further extractions from there and as

far<font color="#E5E5E5"> as retention periods go with full</font>

pcap most organizations are just going

<font color="#CCCCCC">to you know keep a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple weeks worth</font>

full pcap you know maybe you're a place

951
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:30,740
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> el lbnl Lawrence Livermore Berkeley</font>

952

National Lab whatever and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

953
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:39,290
use flow cut off to keep a longer period

954
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:40,940
of peak app but of its all truncated so

955
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:44,210
they'll keep for example the first five

956
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:46,220
of every SSL or TLS connection because

957
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:48,440
the interesting metadata for them is

958
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:49,819
those certificates and those handshakes

959
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,109
that happen at the beginning once

960
00:35:49,819 --> 00:35:53,150
they've moved into the encrypted

961
00:35:51,109 --> 00:35:54,799
communications it's less interesting for

962
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:56,329
them and they've actually been able to

963
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,369
play<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to their advantage if you</font>

964
00:35:56,329 --> 00:36:00,829
remember when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I heartbleed broke</font>

965
00:35:58,369 --> 00:36:03,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually pull this up here and Google an</font>

966
00:36:00,829 --> 00:36:07,300
article so this could either be a great

967
00:36:03,859 --> 00:36:07,299
thing or disaster let's say

968
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:18,800
let's see here so what her plea broke

969
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:21,350
everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> who was out monitoring their</font>

971
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:26,210
nobody's protocol analyzers really gave

a crap about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> heartbeat event right</font>

973
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:30,920
that vulnerability worked like this<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

979
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:48,440
that that vulnerably worked and the

980
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:50,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem was was that everybody that was</font>

full pcap they've got their protocol

984

logs they're pulling files out no one

985
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:59,960
could look at their logs and say was I

986
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:02,780
compromised by this or not because

<font color="#E5E5E5">nobody's protocol analyzers not bros not</font>

998
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:31,069
have two<font color="#E5E5E5"> years of full pcap on a 40 gig</font>

999
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:33,259
connection<font color="#E5E5E5"> WTF how is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> possible and</font>

1000
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:35,180
the answer is it's not possible so this

1001
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:36,560
article<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of wrong you know they</font>

1002
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:38,089
weren't able to pivot back through two

1003
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:40,570
years what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the article should say is you</font>

1004
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:43,700
know within the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> five megabytes of</font>

1005
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:45,920
ssl/tls sessions we did not see

1006
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:48,620
heartbleed in any of those handshakes

1007
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:50,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">right a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more accurate but the</font>

1008
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:52,040
point sort of holds here when you're

1009
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:55,130
when you're setting up these retention

1010
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:57,290
policies for your different data you

1011
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:58,760
know there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a lot of times</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when you</font>

1012
00:37:57,290 --> 00:38:00,170
know you can only<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer a question back</font>

1013
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,790
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a certain point of time because you</font>

1014
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:04,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">would need to go to full pcap in order</font>

1015
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:07,310
to conduct that analysis other types of

1016
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:09,529
metadata derived metadata keep that

1017
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:12,140
forever these protocol logs bro logs or

1018
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:14,540
otherwise<font color="#CCCCCC"> shirkadda seems to be moving a</font>

1019
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:17,690
little bit in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the protocol meta</font>

1020
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:19,970
data logging direction when you look at

1021
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:21,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">there now creating like an HTTP log and</font>

1022
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:24,310
things like that it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great team over</font>

1023
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:26,599
at 0<font color="#E5E5E5"> is f</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> victors doing a phenomenal job</font>

1024
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:28,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">dr metadata it's very</font>

1025
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:29,809
small it can be very small<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep that</font>

1026
00:38:28,279 --> 00:38:32,269
forever you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know compresses down very</font>

1027
00:38:29,809 --> 00:38:33,710
well with things like bro for example

1028
00:38:32,269 --> 00:38:35,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know you'll want to have a strategy</font>

1029
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:38,569
and say like you know I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have the</font>

1030
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:40,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">last month of logs searchable quickly so</font>

1031
00:38:38,569 --> 00:38:42,529
I'll set up an elk database and index

1032
00:38:40,549 --> 00:38:44,479
all those logs but for long-term storage

1033
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:45,950
that's not sustainable so well in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1034
00:38:44,479 --> 00:38:47,808
long term will also put all of our logs

1035
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:49,609
into how do so we have to have a you

1036
00:38:47,809 --> 00:38:51,920
know a long-term store where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can ask</font>

1037
00:38:49,609 --> 00:38:53,538
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> long-term question but still have the</font>

1038
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,999
logs index locally to support the

1039
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:59,180
hunting use case of quickly pivoting

1040
00:38:55,999 --> 00:39:00,499
through network traffic and then when

1041
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:02,569
you think about alerts whether they're

1042
00:39:00,499 --> 00:39:04,549
from Bruce Norman Shaw ricotta or some

1043
00:39:02,569 --> 00:39:06,529
other appliance those<font color="#E5E5E5"> should also be</font>

1044
00:39:04,549 --> 00:39:08,089
kept<font color="#E5E5E5"> forever as well so we've kind of</font>

1045
00:39:06,529 --> 00:39:10,099
gone<font color="#CCCCCC"> through a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of theory and I like</font>

1046
00:39:08,089 --> 00:39:13,578
to do practical things so let's pivot

1047
00:39:10,099 --> 00:39:19,369
out and let's do a quick demo let's go

1048
00:39:13,579 --> 00:39:20,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">ahead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> skip out here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so I'm</font>

1049
00:39:19,369 --> 00:39:23,200
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually merge my screens</font>

1050
00:39:20,569 --> 00:39:23,200
together here

1051
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:42,399
all right so everybody see perfect and

1052
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:44,380
put my baby in a pot all right so what

1053
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,060
I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> done here is I wanted to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start by</font>

1054
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:49,060
looking at some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the different types</font>

1055
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:51,490
of metadata to support these examples

1056
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:55,119
and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine that we're actually</font>

1057
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:57,160
looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> a traffic sample from poop</font>

1058
00:39:55,119 --> 00:40:00,190
over internet or vacant<font color="#E5E5E5"> over internet or</font>

1059
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:02,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">any other use case of thing one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

1060
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:04,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">reasons why I think many of us in this</font>

1061
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:07,000
room here have gravitated to network

1062
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:08,740
security monitoring NSM is is that the

1063
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,020
practical position that it gives us is

1064
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:13,839
that it allows us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to monitor and</font>

1065
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:15,369
intercept and to understand devices that

1066
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:17,050
are even outside of our control if

1067
00:40:15,369 --> 00:40:19,240
you're you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's nothing worse in</font>

1068
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:21,700
any job as having responsibility for

1069
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:23,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">something but no authority to execute on</font>

1070
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:24,520
those results now that is a recipe for

1071
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:26,290
disaster if you're in a position like

1072
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,940
that it's not going to end well all

1073
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:29,259
right you can't be held responsible when

1074
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:30,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're not allowed to make any decisions</font>

1075
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,380
you know those sort of two things should

1076
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:34,150
go hand in hand but<font color="#E5E5E5"> with network</font>

1077
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:36,400
security monitoring you sort of put

1078
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:38,230
yourself in a position to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to</font>

1079
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,480
pull metadata from anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's in</font>

1080
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:43,660
your in your domain<font color="#E5E5E5"> and things like bro</font>

1081
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:45,369
are actually you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of attacking</font>

1082
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:48,098
the network at the weakest point you

1083
00:40:45,369 --> 00:40:50,109
know the internet works because we've

1084
00:40:48,099 --> 00:40:52,570
agreed upon communication protocols and

1085
00:40:50,109 --> 00:40:54,339
it doesn't matter<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's my phone this</font>

1086
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:56,650
this you know remote control that

1087
00:40:54,339 --> 00:40:58,420
projector you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> macbooks Windows</font>

1088
00:40:56,650 --> 00:41:00,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">Linux we've all agreed upon those</font>

1089
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:02,410
communication protocols so if you're

1090
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:04,630
speaking sip I don't need an agent you

1091
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:06,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">know on that device I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> needed an</font>

1092
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:09,250
analyzer that<font color="#CCCCCC"> can parse it all right and</font>

1093
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:11,200
I can now collect metadata so what I've

1094
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:13,450
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> with here is one of the sands</font>

1095
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:16,779
holiday pcap so who who plays with these

1096
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:18,399
anybody couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well this will be</font>

1097
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:20,440
new for most you then these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are amazing</font>

1098
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,080
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sudoku says a great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> job every year</font>

1099
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:25,960
he comes up with these really elaborate

1100
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:27,609
fictional scenarios and he drops a pcap

1101
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:30,070
to sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of highlight some of the year's</font>

1102
00:41:27,609 --> 00:41:31,779
most exciting attacks and in this case

1103
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:34,450
this is from 2011 so it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little dated</font>

1104
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:35,859
and the the victor there was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> laptop a</font>

1105
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:37,868
couple laptops are being given away to

1106
00:41:35,859 --> 00:41:40,089
the best the winners<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this competition</font>

1107
00:41:37,869 --> 00:41:43,269
and so what i've<font color="#CCCCCC"> done here is i've</font>

1108
00:41:40,089 --> 00:41:44,949
configured bro to do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

1109
00:41:43,269 --> 00:41:46,988
the first thing we're doing is we're

1110
00:41:44,949 --> 00:41:49,029
simply just collecting you know protocol

1111
00:41:46,989 --> 00:41:53,679
logs here and who's looked at bro logs

1112
00:41:49,029 --> 00:41:55,059
before them<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bros awesome that</font>

1113
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:56,349
you guys we got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do a workshop maybe</font>

1114
00:41:55,059 --> 00:41:58,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll do that at the end of the day if</font>

1115
00:41:56,349 --> 00:42:01,239
everybody still sober enough which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1116
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:03,098
<font color="#E5E5E5">doubt right bro logs are basically</font>

1117
00:42:01,239 --> 00:42:04,839
collecting layers of metadata metadata

1118
00:42:03,099 --> 00:42:07,599
for you so I like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

1119
00:42:04,839 --> 00:42:10,149
bro cake<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so you think about in</font>

1120
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:13,749
a network traffic i might say hey JLo

1121
00:42:10,149 --> 00:42:15,880
ass in and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'd say syn ACK right so</font>

1122
00:42:13,749 --> 00:42:17,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">boom we've got a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp connection up right</font>

1123
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:20,679
here this is that flow layer this crispy

1124
00:42:17,859 --> 00:42:24,308
connection layer crust<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and this</font>

1125
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:26,919
could be you know UDP or ICMP as well

1126
00:42:24,309 --> 00:42:28,869
and bro uses the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mach flow standard just</font>

1127
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:30,489
like every other tool out there and then

1128
00:42:28,869 --> 00:42:33,699
on top<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this Jason what protocol are</font>

1129
00:42:30,489 --> 00:42:35,169
we going to speak we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be TCP</font>

1130
00:42:33,699 --> 00:42:36,249
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then on top of TCP let's say I want</font>

1131
00:42:35,169 --> 00:42:38,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get a web page so we're going to</font>

1132
00:42:36,249 --> 00:42:39,488
speak we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to speak HTTP so</font>

1133
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:41,499
there's our there's our next layer of

1134
00:42:39,489 --> 00:42:44,049

1135
00:42:41,499 --> 00:42:45,759
creamy HTTP filling and there's various

00:42:44,049 --> 00:42:47,619
types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of metadata that are interesting</font>

00:42:45,759 --> 00:42:49,719
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the connection</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> crust layer about</font>

1138
00:42:47,619 --> 00:42:52,059
TCP there's various types of metadata

1139
00:42:49,719 --> 00:42:56,579
that are only relevant inside the HTTP

1140
00:42:52,059 --> 00:43:00,519
layer and I might<font color="#E5E5E5"> say you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know get me a</font>

1142
00:43:00,519 --> 00:43:04,209
we have a files layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> two so that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

1143

1144
00:43:04,209 --> 00:43:09,098
our creamy you know cherry filling here

1145
00:43:06,909 --> 00:43:12,549
and our crispy gram crapper crapper

1146

internet a poop again a cracker of bro

1147
00:43:12,549 --> 00:43:17,169
crust and then on top of that maybe you

1148
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:18,429
handed me a virus so we could have an

1149
00:43:17,169 --> 00:43:20,019
alert and that could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the little</font>

1151
00:43:20,019 --> 00:43:23,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at these logs here and again</font>

1152
00:43:21,639 --> 00:43:26,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll pass these out afterwards you know</font>

1153
00:43:23,979 --> 00:43:28,959
think of them as layers of metadata

1154
00:43:26,619 --> 00:43:30,459
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some booty here</font>

1155
00:43:28,959 --> 00:43:31,959
let's orient ourselves with this for

1156
00:43:30,459 --> 00:43:33,969
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> P cap and kind of understand what</font>

1157
00:43:31,959 --> 00:43:36,459
happens here and we'll do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that by</font>

1158
00:43:33,969 --> 00:43:39,069
pivoting through the layers<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cake here</font>

1159
00:43:36,459 --> 00:43:40,479
so let's start with<font color="#CCCCCC"> con dot log and the</font>

1160
00:43:39,069 --> 00:43:41,769
bro logs all have this like nice little

1161
00:43:40,479 --> 00:43:43,808
pattern to them and as you start using

1162
00:43:41,769 --> 00:43:45,339
bro logs or if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> designing or</font>

1163
00:43:43,809 --> 00:43:47,259
building your own custom bro logs you

1164
00:43:45,339 --> 00:43:49,179
will learn this pattern you'll master

1165
00:43:47,259 --> 00:43:51,459
very quickly here so we've got the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

1166
00:43:49,179 --> 00:43:53,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">stamp a connection ID which if there's</font>

1167
00:43:51,459 --> 00:43:55,419
any database folks in here the

1168
00:43:53,079 --> 00:43:57,070
connection<font color="#CCCCCC"> ID is sort of like a primary</font>

1169
00:43:55,419 --> 00:43:59,350
key right you can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to pay</font>

1170
00:43:57,070 --> 00:44:02,520
that between<font color="#E5E5E5"> a slice of cake you know</font>

1171
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:06,880
for one flow show me all of the the con

1172
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:08,350
HTTP files you know notice and other

1173
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,440
logs that are associated<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that all</font>

1174
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:13,299
be linked by that one connection ID so

1175
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,370
we see here that we had these two<font color="#E5E5E5"> hosts</font>

1176
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:18,820
and originator and a responder speaking

1177
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:22,720
on 25 speaking smtp and i'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> just walk</font>

1178
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:25,000
up that one little area there so for the

1179
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:26,879
smtp layer you know or for the con layer

1180
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,650
we collected things like duration

1181
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:34,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">direction size of the flow from the</font>

1184
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:40,540
information has been selectively

1185
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:42,730
repeated here you know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this were a</font>

1186
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:44,350
real you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know normalized database you</font>

1187
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:45,610
wouldn't replicate it like that but

1188
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:47,020
these logs are not designed for

1189
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:48,940
computers they're designed for analysts

1190
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:50,710
to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to quickly pivot into and not</font>

1191
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:52,150
have to do like a joint in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my head I</font>

1192
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:54,610
just want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to see oh is this</font>

1193
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:56,380
the host that I'm looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at here and we</font>

1194
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:59,350
see that we're collecting certain data

1195
00:44:56,380 --> 00:45:02,980
from you know who is the sender the

1196
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:07,299
receiver the dates the result<font color="#E5E5E5"> reported</font>

1197
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:10,210
user agents<font color="#CCCCCC"> mail title and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also there's</font>

1198
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:12,760
any unique files so that connection

1199
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:15,250
transmitted to files there so let's walk

1200
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:16,840
up to the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> layer files dot log and</font>

1201
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:19,270
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> see here that we have transmitting</font>

1202
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:20,950
host saw and receiving host uh we have

1203
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:22,480
connections that those r associated with

1204
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:24,279
so in this first log we have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

1205
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,110
connection ID twice because we had two

1206
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:27,700
files right and then there's certain

1207
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:29,320
metadata that we would extract that

1208
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:31,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're interested in for that layer so</font>

1209
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:33,670
things like file hashes that they were

1210
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:37,120
extracted what the extraction name was

1211
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:39,610
and so forth right and so what I've done

1212
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:43,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">here is I've customized a bro script to</font>

1213
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:44,500
do dynamic mine detection on every file

1214
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:45,850
in every protocol and this is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

1215
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:49,090
short<font color="#E5E5E5"> bro script it's up on my github</font>

1216
00:45:45,850 --> 00:45:51,190
and I name the file with the number for

1217
00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:53,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">the order that it was in put a dash the</font>

1218
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:55,480
protocol it was from the file<font color="#CCCCCC"> id and</font>

1219
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:57,190
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lookup to a table so I can</font>

1220
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:59,650
name it with the correct extension so

1221
00:45:57,190 --> 00:46:03,370
here I've it dot txt and dot dot which

1222
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:04,840
is helpful for<font color="#CCCCCC"> this demo which is where</font>

1223
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:08,410
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sort of quickly solve a</font>

1224
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:10,900
problem using these tools collecting

1225
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:12,879
these various layers of metadata

1226
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:15,369
so what I've done is I've extracted all

1227
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:17,380
these files and now in you know Mac

1228
00:46:15,369 --> 00:46:18,940
preview which I'm not recommending as an

1229
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:21,490
incident response tool it's great<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a</font>

1230
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:23,140
demonstration tool we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can quickly</font>

1231
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:25,538
understand what happened here you know

1232
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:27,788
I'm an analyst I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a notice that</font>

1233
00:46:25,539 --> 00:46:29,470
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a candidate incident now I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1234
00:46:27,789 --> 00:46:32,079
to validate is this a true positive or

1235
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:33,970
false positive<font color="#CCCCCC"> and in this process we</font>

1236
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:35,380
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> even discover some things that we</font>

1237
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:37,270
didn't get an alert on some false

1238
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:38,890
negatives and then I got to think how

1239
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:40,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">can I turn those false negatives into a</font>

1240
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:43,450
true positive and remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to our</font>

1241
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:46,118
strategy what the CEO and what the

1242
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:47,859
scissor should be collecting is is if

1243
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:50,140
you're that person you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start</font>

1244
00:46:47,859 --> 00:46:52,328
tracking how long does it take to handle

1245
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:53,980
each incident to do my quick validation

1246
00:46:52,329 --> 00:46:57,640
steps for each incident because if you

1247
00:46:53,980 --> 00:47:00,819
want to respond faster which you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1248
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:01,839
do based on the math those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the kind</font>

1249
00:47:00,819 --> 00:47:03,940
of metrics that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to be paying</font>

1250
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:06,190
attention to becomes like a playing

1251
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:11,079
baseball<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so there was an email</font>

1252
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:16,539
and there was a word document attached

1253
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:18,190
and the web the browser went to this<font color="#CCCCCC"> web</font>

1254
00:47:16,539 --> 00:47:19,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">page you know Santa's naughty list here</font>

1255
00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:24,369
I'll pivot back to the logs here for a

1256
00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:25,868
second to http log we see a get get get

1257
00:47:24,369 --> 00:47:30,130
all right and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to look for</font>

favorite I condotta<font color="#CCCCCC"> I CL no favicon.ico</font>

1260
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:39,460
know why they asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> twice at admittedly</font>

1261
00:47:36,339 --> 00:47:42,038
mistake there and somebody put name

00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:46,839
equals grandma into that box who knows

1263

HTTP what what's happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> here filled</font>

here and I throw it to you awesome and

1272
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:08,859
then you process that data and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you</font>

think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the fav icon not found</font>

1275
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:20,190
a server air right all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so name</font>

sent me back was grandma is naughty

1278
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:26,970

00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:33,509
we go cousin<font color="#CCCCCC"> plus melis put that in the</font>

1282
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:36,209
box we hit submit and again that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1283
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:38,820
post request right I'll here's look

1284
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:41,010
there's the post request right and just

1285
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:41,970
thinking through it so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this log you</font>

1286
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:45,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">know think of these like an Excel</font>

1287
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:47,069
spreadsheet there's two files associated

1288
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:48,900
with the post request right<font color="#E5E5E5"> the file</font>

1289
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:51,770
from the originator which is a text

1290
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:55,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">plane and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Jason sent me back a</font>

1291
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:56,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">webpage right that makes sense hmm be</font>

1292
00:48:55,050 --> 00:49:00,120
weird if my server stopped the

1293
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:04,169
delivering web pages but but a will go

1294
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:05,759
on ok so again I'm being judged and

1295
00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:09,360
evaluated by how quickly I can solve

1296
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:12,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">these problems then grandma puts</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> % 27</font>

1297
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:18,350
into the box and<font color="#E5E5E5"> press submit what's</font>

1298
00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:18,350
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's that what's that character</font>

1299
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:22,820
just shout something out

1300
00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:31,839
oh you guys can't see it it's right

1301
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:34,240
there % 27 it is a single quote right

1302
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:38,920
right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what does that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean it means</font>

1303
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:40,839
grandma is a bitch right<font color="#CCCCCC"> because Jason</font>

1304
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:42,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">just told me you have an air in your</font>

1305
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:44,140
sequel syntax check the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mandala</font>

1306
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:46,029
corresponds to my sequel server version

1307
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:49,150
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right syntax to use near</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

1308
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:50,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">quotes ah and now remember I'm passive</font>

1309
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:53,110
here I'm just just in the middle I don't

1310
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:54,400
have access to Jason's configuration I

1311
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:56,830
didn't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that he was running my</font>

1312
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,810
sequel but I do now so as an incident

1313
00:49:56,830 --> 00:50:01,029
responder I've just collected some very

1314
00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:03,430
powerful and important metadata I could

1315
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:04,720
see you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the traffic what what</font>

1316
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:07,600
he's saying he's running is he running

1317
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:09,368
engine X is<font color="#E5E5E5"> running Apache but he wasn't</font>

1318
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:11,560
telling<font color="#CCCCCC"> me that he's wearing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my sequel</font>

1319
00:50:09,369 --> 00:50:14,020
to now so both me and the threat actor

1320
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:15,670
just acknowledge that and now if this

1321
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:17,470
were my<font color="#E5E5E5"> incident I would mark this as</font>

1322
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:19,540
confirmed and i would i would pass this

1323
00:50:17,470 --> 00:50:21,189
along down to somebody to remediate

1324
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:22,900
right I wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to go I might I</font>

1325
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:26,020
might go further but I would say this is

1326
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:28,720
you know now someone else's problem but

1327
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:31,540
let's go on so then grandma puts % 27

1328
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:33,850
show databases in and the web server

1329
