bar we will be joining you shortly I

25
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:25,579
promise so why am I here two<font color="#E5E5E5"> reasons</font>

26
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:29,788
actually the first and foremost is that

27
00:01:25,579 --> 00:01:32,428
I hope to give a presentation today

28
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:34,799
which inspires inspires in two different

29
00:01:32,429 --> 00:01:36,450
ways the first one I hope you guys take

30
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,060
a look at the presentation that i give

31
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:42,750
and think to yourself I can do better

32
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,820
than that and then next year you come

33
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:48,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">out and give a better presentation and</font>

34
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:50,999
then all of a sudden next year the 27

35
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:53,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">beast 2017 besides is a little better</font>

36
00:01:50,999 --> 00:01:56,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">than the 2016 so that would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be great but</font>

37
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">the big thing I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about is</font>

38
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:00,899
active directory and passwords so who is

39
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:04,109
it an environment where they have active

40
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:06,569
directory and who has a password for

41
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:09,199
their Active Directory account of course

42
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:13,260
we all do and guess who else<font color="#E5E5E5"> knows this</font>

43
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:16,019
all of our adversaries and so they

44
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,850
utilize that<font color="#E5E5E5"> too as part of their attack</font>

45
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:21,990
platform

46
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:24,470
so um yeah I'm generally not going to

47
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:28,200
read the slides so read them yourselves

48
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:29,580
if there's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's hard to say</font>

49
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">this with the straight face there's</font>

50
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,380
actually enough interest in what I put

51
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:36,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">together I will make it available I</font>

52
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:41,010
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that doubtful but we'll see how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

53
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:42,750
goes so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are we going so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

54
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:46,109
presentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> I put together for my</font>

55
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:48,120
company and they've asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> me not to use</font>

56
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:53,070
their name today which tells you just

57
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:55,010
how excited they were about it and so

58
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:58,560
I'm basically going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use that as a</font>

59
00:02:55,010 --> 00:03:01,500
framework to talk to you guys and

60
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,230
inspire you guys what I want you guys to

61
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:07,470
take away from<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is to look at this</font>

62
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:09,179
presentation and go well a like there's

63
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">no background graphics there's no</font>

64
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,400
company name it's kind of a shitty

65
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:16,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">PowerPoint deck but I want you guys to</font>

66
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,720
look at this and realize you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could take</font>

67
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:21,570
this presentation and give it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

68
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:25,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">own company and then I want you guys to</font>

69
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:29,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">be able to inspire your own companies to</font>

70
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:32,130
move from a compliant password standard

71
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:34,109
to a secure password standard and i'm

72
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:38,040
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give you guys the math that</font>

73
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:40,260
will help you make that case so most

74
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,570
companies use active directory for

75
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,940
single sign-on most companies also layer

76
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:48,600
that behind some other single sign-on

77
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:50,489
product that feel right do people have

78
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:58,530
an additional single sign-on product on

79
00:03:50,489 --> 00:04:00,810
top of 80 or alongside ad yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so i</font>

80
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:04,049
was just put together<font color="#E5E5E5"> who am i slide and</font>

81
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:06,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">then someone told me no one cares but if</font>

82
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:10,019
anyone does I've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> in IT for a long</font>

83
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:12,180
time I started it compusa which is now

84
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:15,320
out of business selling I was there<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

85
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:21,358
the windows 95 launch party in October

86
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:22,950
it was kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy and since then I've</font>

87
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,109
worked at most our safe company which is

88
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:26,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">also out of business now and that I've</font>

89
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:29,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">worked for a fair number of companies</font>

90
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:30,120
most of which were probably customers up

91
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:33,960
so thank you

92
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:37,380
much I appreciate your business oh yeah

93
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:39,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">darkside I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in management now it kind of</font>

94
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">sucks when they take the good technical</font>

95
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,910
people at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least that's why I like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

96
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:46,080
think of myself and put them in the

97
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:49,860
management roles but here<font color="#CCCCCC"> i am i have a</font>

98
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:53,219
link up to my blog kind of for humor

99
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:57,930
purposes it was updated in 2015 so it's

100
00:04:53,220 --> 00:05:01,560
right there<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay obligatory verizon dvir</font>

101
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:06,090
slide the most recent<font color="#CCCCCC"> dvir says that</font>

102
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:07,830
passwords are adorable but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing</font>

103
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:10,560
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think you guys can take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> away</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

104
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:14,280
this to talk to your company's about is

105
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,800
that attackers don't just bypass the

106
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,900
passwords they use them against<font color="#E5E5E5"> us they</font>

107
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,600
use our<font color="#E5E5E5"> own passwords against this what</font>

108
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:24,299
does that mean once they<font color="#CCCCCC"> compromised our</font>

109
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,160
environment and get that foothold then

110
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,350
they take those password hashes they

111
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,199
crack those password hashes and then

112
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:35,639
they use those for lateral movement so

113
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:37,800
by having a weak password standard or by

114
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:40,919
having<font color="#E5E5E5"> a compliant password standard</font>

115
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:44,250
shutter or by not using multi-factor

116
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:47,520
authentication we make<font color="#E5E5E5"> our jobs a whole</font>

117
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:49,260
lot easier for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the adversaries so by</font>

118
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,180
following the best practices put

119
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:53,099
together by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> PCI</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Council and some of</font>

120
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:55,800
the other groups we're making things

121
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:57,750
easier for our adversaries I think

122
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,910
that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty good talking point that</font>

123
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:04,260
you guys can use with your with your

124
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:05,699
company's I've note up here to talk

125
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,849
about fishing campaigns that's come up

126
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:11,099
with a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the other presentations</font>

127
00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:17,340
does anybody know what this one / 30 is

128
00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:26,849
that I'm representing<font color="#E5E5E5"> who yes and so</font>

129
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:32,388
defined success wrong even worse nope so

130
00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:36,599
yeah guess people who reported one of 30

131
00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:40,409
campaigns are reported to their info SEC

132
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:41,950
people so this is based off of companies

133
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:45,940
like fish me

134
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:49,000
and what is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wombat so the legitimate</font>

135
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:51,030
fishing companies that our employers pay

136
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,100
for to use to fish our own employees

137
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:58,780
they went through I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about 8</font>

138
00:06:54,100 --> 00:07:00,340
million actual phishing emails and then

139
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:02,710
those were grouped in X number of

140
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:05,109
campaigns one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 30 campaigns are</font>

141
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:07,299
reported to<font color="#E5E5E5"> info</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sac so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next time</font>

142
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:09,610
you get that email from that diligent

143
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:12,370
user and we all have that one user that

144
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:14,500
reports a fishing campaign remember

145
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:17,530
there are probably 30 other campaigns

146
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,940
that didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get reported the other thing</font>

147
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:21,820
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to call out the three minutes and</font>

148
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:25,210
45 seconds is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the median time it takes</font>

149
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:28,390
for a fish to employee to report the

150
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:29,950
fact that they were fished to me the

151
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:32,229
biggest thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take away</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

152
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:36,130
metric is that my employees<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a lot</font>

153
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:37,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">more on top of their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> email than I am so</font>

154
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:40,719
next thing going to talk about single

155
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:44,110
sign-on we got a system to standard so

156
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,630
why do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have single sign on the</font>

157
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:48,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">security benefit it's hard to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say with a</font>

158
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:50,530
straight face so the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

159
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:53,770
security benefit there is that by having

160
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:56,080
one password on our machines that browse

161
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:57,969
the internet and using<font color="#CCCCCC"> that same</font>

162
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,950
password to access our critical our

163
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:03,790
company's most critical data we've

164
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:05,380
somehow made things more secure I'm not

165
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:08,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure I follow but that's what the sales</font>

166
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:11,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">guys say in sales guys don't like the</font>

167
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:14,200
end user benefit apparently end users

168
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:16,300
are really bad remembering passwords and

169
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:19,030
so by having them only<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember one</font>

170
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:26,650
password that makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> things a whole lot</font>

171
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:28,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">easier for the end user yes so for those</font>

172
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:33,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">people that do have their secure ID</font>

173
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:39,909
tokens we do have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pin that you have to</font>

174
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:41,978
remember that<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes along with that so so</font>

175
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:43,209
yes so you've got your single sign-on

176
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:45,280
password you use for Active Directory

177
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:47,980
you've got your pin for security token

178
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then you've got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the site or password</font>

179
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:55,230
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to use for your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> travel site</font>

180
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:57,330
yeah yep yeah you have that yep so

181
00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:00,390
so we've got this great single sign-on

182
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:03,420
system here so that our users really

183
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:07,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">only have about 40 passwords that they</font>

184
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:09,270
have to remember again I redacted this

185
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:14,690
who could put<font color="#E5E5E5"> together</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> slide like this</font>

186
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:18,540
for their<font color="#CCCCCC"> own employer amen brother amen</font>

187
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:21,300
yeah so we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> all we can all put this</font>

188
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:23,280
presentation together this is not hard I

189
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,500
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> take Latin in high school but i</font>

190
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:29,670
believe it's Quattro<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dec I'm sign-on is</font>

191
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:32,700
where we're at right now um so<font color="#E5E5E5"> yay we</font>

192
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:36,680
spent lots money we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got probably a</font>

193
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:39,420
dozen employees that work on our

194
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:42,239
department that maintains the single

195
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:46,290
sign-on product they really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hated this</font>

196
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:48,710
slide but you see whatever so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

197
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:52,260
more of a management thing or for your

198
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:54,180
less technical people but it can be

199
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:57,720
helpful to digress and go down that path

200
00:09:54,180 --> 00:10:01,109
of what how does<font color="#CCCCCC"> your computer actually</font>

201
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:05,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">store passwords so you can have plain</font>

202
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:08,100
text you can have a encrypted password

203
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:10,800
or you can have a hashed password if you

204
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:13,470
have any sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of app dev people in that</font>

205
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">ah any sort of app dev people in that</font>

206
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:18,420
audience that you can talk to get have

207
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,190
that conversation with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them on the</font>

208
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:22,560
difference between an encrypted password

209
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:26,310
in a hashed password a lot of your app

210
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:28,760
dev people that are you can't call<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

211
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:31,500
dumb but that are writing their own

212
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:35,970
authentication modules they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

213
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:38,370
encrypt the end users password bad bad

214
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:40,530
bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea so you're hashing is that</font>

215
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:42,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">one-way mathematical function that</font>

216
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:45,209
encryption is that two-way reversible

217
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:47,340
function so if they are encrypting their

218
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:50,310
passwords for any internally developed

219
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:52,590
applications they've made their jobs

220
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:55,619
harder in major security posture week

221
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:58,950
it's a whole lot easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do an LDAP</font>

222
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:00,600
query to Active Directory let ad handle

223
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:02,460
all that kind of stuff makes it<font color="#E5E5E5"> a whole</font>

224
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:06,760
lot easier on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end user while making</font>

225
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:09,730
things more secure so

226
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:11,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">I do I am going to get into password</font>

227
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:12,940
cracking because I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was kind</font>

228
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:16,990
of fun I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was going to be kind</font>

229
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:18,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">of easy but we're not quite there yet so</font>

230
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:23,800
we're going to talk a little bit about

231
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:27,340
math so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is password cracking it's</font>

232
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:31,329
basically a process whereby you've got

233
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:33,310
the your pass password hashes your and

234
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:35,620
then you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got some sort of process</font>

235
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:37,869
that knows the hashing algorithm used

236
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:40,600
and then it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just starts with is your</font>

237
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:43,390
password a no its password be no

238
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:45,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">suppress would see no keeps moving on</font>

239
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:47,860
until<font color="#E5E5E5"> it finds the right right thing</font>

240
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,180
it's basically like giving your your

241
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:52,330
seven-year-old in the back seat on a

242
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:53,890
trip to Florida the chance to try it so

243
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:55,810
a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different ways</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

244
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:58,300
password cracking first one is brute

245
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:59,859
force this is the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I actually</font>

246
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:03,010
explore a little deeper and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest of</font>

247
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:06,460
the presentation because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

248
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:08,620
stupid and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really slow brute force</font>

249
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:11,980
is really the slowest way to convert

250
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:15,070
password hashes into plain text the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

251
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:16,660
one you can use as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the dictionary we're</font>

252
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:18,250
about you literally get in English

253
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,780
dictionary if you do<font color="#CCCCCC"> business in France</font>

254
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:21,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> French dictionary if you do</font>

255
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:23,740
business<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Lithuania you do a</font>

256
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:25,180
Lithuanian dictionary if you have nerds

257
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:28,210
you do Star Trek dictionary you should

258
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:30,969
put them all together and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you just</font>

259
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:35,530
hash those words and see if you get any

260
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:39,100
matches a hybrid does things like adds a

261
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:41,020
zero to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end you know in Cincinnati a</font>

262
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,910
hybrid attack may take words like

263
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:44,230
Bengals and<font color="#E5E5E5"> adds words like sucks and</font>

264
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:48,069
puts them together and see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

265
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:49,630
get anything it'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> do substitutions</font>

266
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:52,090
where it takes ease and replaces them

267
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:54,280
with threes<font color="#E5E5E5"> O's replaces them with zeros</font>

268
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:57,010
uppercase lowercase all kinds of things

269
00:12:54,280 --> 00:13:01,720
like that the hybrid attack is generally

270
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:04,090
your most effective and your fastest the

271
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:07,330
pre computed is also called your rainbow

272
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:09,730
tables and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea there is that you</font>

273
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:13,000
pre hash every<font color="#E5E5E5"> word in your dictionary</font>

274
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:14,320
you pre hash actually not just every

275
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,860
word in your dictionary everything you

276
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">can think of and you pre hash those just</font>

277
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,320
store the hashes and then you can do

278
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:24,400
database

279
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:28,740
lookups in theory<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the fastest</font>

280
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:32,050
your trading CPU power for storage space

281
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:34,240
one of the guys on<font color="#CCCCCC"> my team gave me shit</font>

282
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:36,790
for doing the brute<font color="#CCCCCC"> force he's like dude</font>

283
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,530
I can do past or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rainbow tables</font>

284
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:40,810
would be so much faster you'll never say

285
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:42,670
in a chance I'm like okay so I gave them

286
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:44,650
a box I give<font color="#CCCCCC"> him a bunch of hard drives</font>

287
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:47,110
they said touch<font color="#CCCCCC"> setting up let's see how</font>

288
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:49,750
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes you never got it working so</font>

289
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:56,080
apparently rainbow tables is a little

290
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:59,800
bit harder to set up so how to crack not

291
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:01,780
nearly as easy as<font color="#CCCCCC"> it sounds if you want</font>

292
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:05,140
the deets oh this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the presentation</font>

293
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:07,270
again i gave to basically non-technical

294
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:11,500
people as a way to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the</font>

295
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:13,750
password policy changed talking to you

296
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:16,240
guys if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want the details on this i</font>

297
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:18,460
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> certainly provide them but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

298
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:22,570
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would suggest is creating an ad</font>

299
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:24,430
test environment in pro tip use the same

300
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:28,000
version of a be that you're using in

301
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:30,430
production I setting up with I thought

302
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,900
hey I'll grab server 2008 it's really

303
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:37,150
old certainly that must be what we're

304
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:41,949
using in production nope 2003<font color="#CCCCCC"> um hmm so</font>

305
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:44,770
um create<font color="#E5E5E5"> some test accounts mimic the</font>

306
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:47,500
password complexities<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did it I created</font>

307
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:49,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">one test account for every user in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

308
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:51,970
environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> in hindsight I'm testing my</font>

309
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:53,500
methodology I didn't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> that many test</font>

310
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:57,010
accounts it just slowed down my testing

311
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:58,740
but whatever and then once you figure

312
00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:03,069
out how you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do this and test</font>

313
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:05,770
you're already<font color="#E5E5E5"> four broad so don't be</font>

314
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:08,170
your password hashes uh this turned out

315
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:10,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be a lot more difficult</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than I</font>

316
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:13,540
thought I'm basically an old-school UNIX

317
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,890
guy I figured cat etsy password cat etsy

318
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:19,569
shadow run<font color="#E5E5E5"> him through John the Ripper</font>

319
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:21,430
tool combine them done no um there was

320
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:23,500
some volume Shadow Copy work involved

321
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:25,569
again if you want my notes on this if

322
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:28,780
this is research you'd like to duplicate

323
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:31,660
I didn't put those this is again slide

324
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:33,130
deck for management<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm happy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to provide</font>

325
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,939
you with those notes so that you guys

326
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:40,899
can learn from

327
00:15:33,939 --> 00:15:44,139
I did it's not easy so um but how<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard</font>

328
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:47,439
was it really generally the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way this</font>

329
00:15:44,139 --> 00:15:50,979
worked is the company provided<font color="#CCCCCC"> hardware</font>

330
00:15:47,439 --> 00:15:52,988
in pizza we went to Microsoft's for the

331
00:15:50,979 --> 00:15:55,029
pizza we went to<font color="#E5E5E5"> taco no went to</font>

332
00:15:52,989 --> 00:15:59,379
Microsoft for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hardware we went to</font>

333
00:15:55,029 --> 00:16:01,059
jets for the pizza and it was kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it</font>

334
00:15:59,379 --> 00:16:04,839
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good little team-building exercise</font>

335
00:16:01,059 --> 00:16:06,759
we generally did one hour a week got

336
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:08,709
together usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a more senior person</font>

337
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:10,539
in a more junior person kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of picked</font>

338
00:16:08,709 --> 00:16:14,559
up or the last person left off and work

339
00:16:10,539 --> 00:16:18,189
through it one chunk at a time what's a

340
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:20,439
lot of fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> really so for production</font>

341
00:16:18,189 --> 00:16:24,248
who's all got virtualized domain

342
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:28,329
controllers sweet this makes it really

343
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:32,829
easy get a copy<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a production domain</font>

344
00:16:28,329 --> 00:16:35,019
controller wait this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the easy</font>

345
00:16:32,829 --> 00:16:37,689
part what you want to do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure</font>

346
00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:41,169
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you wait your password expiration</font>

347
00:16:37,689 --> 00:16:43,779
so if you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 30-day password</font>

348
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:45,819
expiration sit on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that vmdk for 30 days</font>

349
00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:47,619
if you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a 90-day password</font>

350
00:16:45,819 --> 00:16:49,628
expiration sit on it for 90 days if you

351
00:16:47,619 --> 00:16:54,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 180-day password expiration how</font>

352
00:16:49,629 --> 00:16:57,029
long do you sit on it 90 days exactly so

353
00:16:54,209 --> 00:16:59,768
then once you've got those hashes

354
00:16:57,029 --> 00:17:04,990
running through your cracking farm go

355
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:07,149
ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and crack him what I did was I set</font>

356
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:09,939
up this whole presentation as a way to

357
00:17:07,148 --> 00:17:12,039
lay out the data with the math to show

358
00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:15,009
everyone that our password standards

359
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:16,869
were strong enough so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did is I</font>

360
00:17:15,009 --> 00:17:18,309
talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my buddy on decide hopefully</font>

361
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:20,469
everybody's got a buddy that does

362
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:23,319
desktop support I said give me the

363
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:25,299
oldest slowest computer you've got

364
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:30,340
sitting around that's what I used for

365
00:17:25,299 --> 00:17:33,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">this so I could then say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay to crack</font>

366
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:37,029
our passwords on one of our standard

367
00:17:33,309 --> 00:17:39,220
machines take almost a year so we've got

368
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:42,580
a I'll go<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead and say it with a 30-day</font>

369
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:45,789
password expiration of my company that's

370
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:47,419
10 times that boom we're good<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go we</font>

371
00:17:45,789 --> 00:17:54,140
have nothing

372
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:58,480
nothing to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> worried about uh to make</font>

373
00:17:54,140 --> 00:18:01,370
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> numbers look bigger yes yeah yeah</font>

374
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:05,600
wish<font color="#E5E5E5"> should get neuro get there I got</font>

375
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:10,489
there so yeah the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason there's a</font>

376
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:12,800
discrepancy between the 2 95 and 263 the

377
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:14,810
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data that i presented here</font>

378
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:18,200
was based on my test environment others

379
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:20,780
was was done based on my production

380
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:23,840
environment so the 295 is actually my

381
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:26,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">Prada environment the 263 was the test</font>

382
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:29,300
environment did I let this run for the

383
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:31,580
whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> time oh dear god no when you fire</font>

384
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:34,040
up hash cat which is what i use and O's

385
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:36,379
well cash cow is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i use for the cpu</font>

386
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:39,080
base cracking oh CL hash cat is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

387
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:41,420
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the GPU base not that i would do</font>

388
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,010
that because we're just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> Corporate</font>

389
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:47,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">Center desktop so we're showing that we</font>

390
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:48,860
are secure see we've we've used math we

391
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">proved that passwords or say if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

392
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:55,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">nothing to be worried about but I have</font>

393
00:18:50,780 --> 00:19:02,990
no idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> why their tutor soon so yeah</font>

394
00:18:55,670 --> 00:19:06,380
exactly exactly I got nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to worry</font>

395
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:08,990
about so what we did I use a real laptop

396
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:11,060
this is my personal laptop that I take

397
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:14,060
with me to training classes and all of a

398
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:17,000
sudden<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we're down to 43 days so when</font>

399
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:21,830
from 295 243 just by running it on

400
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,600
modern hardware just cpu<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a fan</font>

401
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:25,730
of laptops I think they're pretty slow a

402
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:29,419
much more fan of real desktop something

403
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:33,290
with the x79 x99 chipset all of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sudden</font>

404
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:36,050
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're down to 29 days oh we've</font>

405
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:38,750
30-day password policy expiration so now

406
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:42,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">I got a problem to the gentleman that</font>

407
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:42,130
pointing out what about GPUs

408
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:53,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm guessing yes a wife's machine um she</font>

409
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:58,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">she just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> plays portal but you know I had</font>

410
00:19:53,330 --> 00:20:02,830
a 550 TI laying around yeah amen amen so

411
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:04,970
yeah that didn't go nearly as well so

412
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:06,620
earlier in the earlier in the

413
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:08,480
presentation obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> I seated some of</font>

414
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:11,469
the guys from Mike and girls from<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

415
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:15,050
company<font color="#E5E5E5"> to prompt me with some questions</font>

416
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:17,870
I did the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same thing during the actual</font>

417
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:19,490
presentation so as we got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this part I</font>

418
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:21,649
would have people ask me you know what

419
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:24,710
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> GPUs what about you know CPUs</font>

420
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:27,590
faster machines that kind of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> so at</font>

421
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:29,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">this point I had my boss asked dude I</font>

422
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:31,669
gave you I approved over two thousand

423
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:41,030
dollars in expense reports what did you

424
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:45,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">spend all that money on so so yeah we</font>

425
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:49,639
got to play and I will say if anyone

426
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:53,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">wants to duplicate this I fully I really</font>

427
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:58,280
support it it's a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> fun there are</font>

428
00:20:53,600 --> 00:21:00,199
problems out the wazoo you know things

429
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:02,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">like finding a motherboard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that'll</font>

430
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,880
support<font color="#E5E5E5"> three or four video cards is</font>

431
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:07,399
actually not easy finding a case that

432
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,920
will hold that many video cards is not

433
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:14,210
easy finding a power supply<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will</font>

434
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:16,580
drive all that not easy cooling was

435
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:18,560
actually the biggest thing to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

436
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:21,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">perfectly honest price performance wise</font>

437
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:24,860
I did not want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go with the 980 TI the</font>

438
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:27,620
980 made a much better way to go problem

439
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:29,990
is all your<font color="#E5E5E5"> 9 80 s cool by blowing air</font>

440
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:31,639
perpendicular to the board if I stack

441
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:33,110
three of them in a chassis they're just

442
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,640
blowing air right on<font color="#E5E5E5"> top</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of each</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

443
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:36,590
and all of a sudden<font color="#E5E5E5"> how about cooling is</font>

444
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,570
for naught so in order to get the

445
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:42,020
reference cooler which pulls air in the

446
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:46,340
rear and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it sorry pulls air in this side</font>

447
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:49,220
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> k the cards and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> AH and blows it</font>

448
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:51,290
out this side that's like a fifty-dollar

449
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:53,990
cooler so i could have bought stock<font color="#E5E5E5"> 9</font>

450
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:55,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">80s</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and put a reference cooler on it but</font>

451
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:57,200
at that point<font color="#CCCCCC"> i may as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well just buy the</font>

452
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:01,908
980<font color="#E5E5E5"> TI's in</font>

453
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:03,409
980 TI's one of the guys on my<font color="#CCCCCC"> team was</font>

454
00:22:01,909 --> 00:22:05,539
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find a website with some test</font>

455
00:22:03,409 --> 00:22:07,130
software to really push<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cards and</font>

456
00:22:05,539 --> 00:22:10,309
see how they would<font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

457
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:16,960
steampowered com he did lots of testing

458
00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:26,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">I appreciated his diligence um yeah</font>

459
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:31,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">Fitbit yeah okay yeah ninety-six percent</font>

460
00:22:26,299 --> 00:22:33,950
so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is key as</font>

461
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:35,809
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are having this presentation and</font>

462
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:38,360
having this conversation with<font color="#CCCCCC"> people at</font>

463
00:22:35,809 --> 00:22:40,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">your office you do not want to tell them</font>

464
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:43,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you are cracking all of the</font>

465
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:44,990
accounts in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> domain gentleman pointed</font>

466
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:47,630
out service accounts because service

467
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:49,279
accounts are special there's a flag you

468
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:51,010
set in active directory so that the

469
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:53,240
adversary can't use a service account

470
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:54,679
they're all you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are all kinds</font>

471
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:57,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">of special flags you set in active</font>

472
00:22:54,679 --> 00:23:00,440
directory so wait no they're just normal

473
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:04,090
accounts but their passwords<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

474
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:07,190
expire which is bad so<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we did is</font>

475
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:09,080
through the Magica grep our end user

476
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:12,049
accounts<font color="#E5E5E5"> very follow a very specific</font>

477
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:16,549
pattern so we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to pull out just</font>

478
00:23:12,049 --> 00:23:18,200
the end user accounts and leave out

479
00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:22,370
anything it was a service account or

480
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:26,690
stuff like that what<font color="#E5E5E5"> else is interesting</font>

481
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:30,379
on this slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> um thirty-four thousand</font>

482
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:36,529
million guesses per second so 34 billion

483
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:39,559
guesses per second that's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

484
00:23:36,529 --> 00:23:44,750
perfectly<font color="#E5E5E5"> honest I did not dive into why</font>

485
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:47,779
we only<font color="#E5E5E5"> had ninety-six percent I just</font>

486
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:52,370
didn't care but to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be perfectly honest I</font>

487
00:23:47,779 --> 00:23:53,960
did say we had five thousand users no i

488
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:55,158
didn't i shouldn't say that because i

489
00:23:53,960 --> 00:24:01,010
would give away too much about my

490
00:23:55,159 --> 00:24:03,799
company but we had 13,500 heshes in the

491
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:06,740
data set so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first thing that i was</font>

492
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:08,269
surprised we saw password history so

493
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:10,759
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can't reuse old passwords how</font>

494
00:24:08,269 --> 00:24:13,070
many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> per have a policy that pro</font>

495
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:16,129
it's for using old passwords hopefully

496
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:18,109
everyone so once you<font color="#E5E5E5"> dump hashes out of</font>

497
00:24:16,129 --> 00:24:22,099
Active Directory guess what you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

498
00:24:18,109 --> 00:24:28,839
all so we got six<font color="#E5E5E5"> months of password</font>

499
00:24:22,099 --> 00:24:33,708
history for each user what's it oh yeah

500
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:39,739
yeah 13,500 accounts and passwords in

501
00:24:33,709 --> 00:24:43,309
106 minutes but hey we're PCI compliant

502
00:24:39,739 --> 00:24:46,459
so it's all good right no one has

503
00:24:43,309 --> 00:24:49,519
anything to worry about we got we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

504
00:24:46,459 --> 00:24:53,809
a rock from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Auditor um yeah so we're</font>

505
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:55,759
good um yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of sobering so</font>

506
00:24:53,809 --> 00:25:01,158
let's talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> why we were able to do</font>

507
00:24:55,759 --> 00:25:04,609
34 billion guesses per second I did a

508
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:06,739
great class as the sands 504 class

509
00:25:04,609 --> 00:25:08,629
actually where we talked about the LM

510
00:25:06,739 --> 00:25:12,249
hashing algorithm that Microsoft uses

511
00:25:08,629 --> 00:25:15,319
for password storage and they take a

512
00:25:12,249 --> 00:25:20,239
password and they break<font color="#E5E5E5"> it up into 27</font>

513
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:21,918
character chunks so cracking 27

514
00:25:20,239 --> 00:25:25,999
character chunks is just as hard as

515
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:29,199
cracking 114 character trunk right no no

516
00:25:25,999 --> 00:25:31,549
its orders of magnitude slower to be

517
00:25:29,199 --> 00:25:34,489
perfectly honest it's seven orders of

518
00:25:31,549 --> 00:25:36,649
magnitude faster and oh yeah

519
00:25:34,489 --> 00:25:37,940
everything's upper case which for

520
00:25:36,649 --> 00:25:42,289
password cracking makes it really

521
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:47,959
efficient so yeah then we talked about

522
00:25:42,289 --> 00:25:50,029
NT hashes it's a more still an efficient

523
00:25:47,959 --> 00:25:53,479
algorithm which makes things easy on

524
00:25:50,029 --> 00:25:55,639
Microsoft which is nice but it's still

525
00:25:53,479 --> 00:25:57,619
not a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good algorithm so in class</font>

526
00:25:55,639 --> 00:25:59,508
i'm kind of like oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay what's going to</font>

527
00:25:57,619 --> 00:26:02,539
be next what's the thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft</font>

528
00:25:59,509 --> 00:26:05,989
moved on to after NT cuz you know NT

529
00:26:02,539 --> 00:26:08,149
came out while Ashley do I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know</font>

530
00:26:05,989 --> 00:26:11,299
how old<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were when NT came out no</font>

531
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:15,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay good sorry I just hired Ashley from</font>

532
00:26:11,299 --> 00:26:15,940
you see she's a grad as of two weeks ago

533
00:26:16,509 --> 00:26:24,269
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bearcats so um but yeah NT is kind of</font>

534
00:26:20,989 --> 00:26:30,029
where microsoft said<font color="#CCCCCC"> no we're good NT 4</font>

535
00:26:24,269 --> 00:26:37,709
yeah NT 351 yeah good enough so so what

536
00:26:30,029 --> 00:26:39,539
we do about it so Microsoft has some

537
00:26:37,709 --> 00:26:41,940
really bad algorithms for Active

538
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:44,039
Directory passwords so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's bad oh</font>

539
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:46,200
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not getting rid of active</font>

540
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:48,479
directory because<font color="#CCCCCC"> even the guy that did</font>

541
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,409
the mic the<font color="#CCCCCC"> OSX presentation said he</font>

542
00:26:48,479 --> 00:26:52,950
kind of misses<font color="#CCCCCC"> Active Directory</font>

543
00:26:49,409 --> 00:26:57,629
sometimes so maybe unix will be better

544
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:59,820
so we'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to unix in a minute so what</font>

545
00:26:57,629 --> 00:27:02,039
about Windows 10 the windows 10 does a

546
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:04,019
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things to make security better</font>

547
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:06,658
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is awesome who's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> playing with</font>

548
00:27:04,019 --> 00:27:09,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">Windows</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 at home who's playing with</font>

549
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:14,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">Windows 10 at work Wow more than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

550
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:16,200
expected<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay great cool so cutting it</font>

551
00:27:14,609 --> 00:27:21,269
backwards compatibility Microsoft's all

552
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:23,459
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> backwards compatibility so um it's</font>

553
00:27:21,269 --> 00:27:31,440
actually pretty good but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still a</font>

554
00:27:23,459 --> 00:27:33,779
little worse than<font color="#CCCCCC"> time so the who's</font>

555
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:37,349
familiar with Mimi cats played with it a

556
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:40,349
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so Mimi cats has been</font>

557
00:27:37,349 --> 00:27:45,349
implemented<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a module two is it recall</font>

558
00:27:40,349 --> 00:27:49,799
or volatility or both will go with both

559
00:27:45,349 --> 00:27:51,869
and the mini cats guys have realized

560
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:56,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">that there is a data structure in memory</font>

561
00:27:51,869 --> 00:27:59,218
which contains your password hash but if

562
00:27:56,729 --> 00:28:02,309
your password<font color="#CCCCCC"> had if your password is</font>

563
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:05,309
shorter than 14 characters you<font color="#E5E5E5"> also have</font>

564
00:28:02,309 --> 00:28:09,209
the LM format password hash those 27

565
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:13,200
character<font color="#E5E5E5"> chunks okay that's not really</font>

566
00:28:09,209 --> 00:28:16,799
why don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> need that but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft has</font>

567
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:22,139
that in for backwards compatibility and

568
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:23,789
then there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> also an MD digest if you</font>

569
00:28:22,139 --> 00:28:26,369
need to provide your password to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

570
00:28:23,789 --> 00:28:29,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">website for single sign-on that hash is</font>

571
00:28:26,369 --> 00:28:31,049
there in memory and then if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've</font>

572
00:28:29,369 --> 00:28:33,269
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking to a website that has</font>

573
00:28:31,049 --> 00:28:36,719
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad security there's also a plain</font>

574
00:28:33,269 --> 00:28:38,600
text version of your password because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

575
00:28:36,719 --> 00:28:41,790
may be needed

576
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:45,300
so really<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the end of the day it all</font>

577
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:48,840
comes down to length the best way to

578
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:51,919
avoid<font color="#CCCCCC"> that 14 character problem is by</font>

579
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:54,000
using a 15<font color="#CCCCCC"> or 17 character password</font>

580
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:56,760
anything that you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make it</font>

581
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">longer is really what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> she said is what</font>

582
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:04,530
you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do to improve</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

583
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:07,020
capability sir so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hinted about eunuchs</font>

584
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:10,230
so how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people have eunuchs in their</font>

585
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:13,139
environment eunuchs in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> environment</font>

586
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:15,210
yep most of you which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is good best</font>

587
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:17,550
practices recommend a homogenous

588
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:19,170
environment for security purposes

589
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:21,600
because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very hard to secure one</font>

590
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:23,250
platform it's incredibly difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

591
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,830
secure more than one platform so of

592
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:30,000
course what do we all do we run more

593
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:32,189
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> one platform so if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

594
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:36,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">salts to this group does everyone know</font>

595
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:38,970
who's not familiar with salts cool i'll

596
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:41,909
cover it real<font color="#E5E5E5"> briefly so the idea with</font>

597
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:45,810
the salt is that you store<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit</font>

598
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:50,700
of randomness with your password<font color="#E5E5E5"> hash so</font>

599
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:54,840
that way so quick digression let's go

600
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:57,060
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten slides five thousand users six</font>

601
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:59,459
months worth of history that's 30,000

602
00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:01,669
password<font color="#CCCCCC"> hashes I was working with but</font>

603
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:04,620
if you remember that<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide we only had</font>

604
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:07,290
13,500 hashes that we were looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at so</font>

605
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:10,129
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the other 27 know what</font>

606
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:14,399
happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the other 16,500 hashes</font>

607
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:16,650
there were duplicates so if two users

608
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:21,090
use that same password of you know Reds

609
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:24,630
2016 they get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that same hash that's why</font>

610
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:27,419
rainbow tables work rainbow tables work

611
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:30,780
because multiple users using the same

612
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:34,140
password get the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> password hash if</font>

613
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:37,760
you add a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of entropy to that</font>

614
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:40,740
password in that password hash field

615
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:43,050
then when the computer is calculating

616
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:45,180
what your password should be you type in

617
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:49,530
your password it's combined<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that</font>

618
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:50,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">entropy the salt and then used to use</font>

619
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:56,530
this part of the hashing algorithm

620
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:59,500
generate your password hash so what I

621
00:30:56,530 --> 00:31:02,860
did is I created<font color="#CCCCCC"> thirty two thousand two</font>

622
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:05,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">hundred</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> accounts along with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their and</font>

623
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:07,719
then set the password<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool how was I</font>

624
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:09,610
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this well obviously</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I had the</font>

625
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:12,940
usernames that was really easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

626
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:14,590
dumped from my NT domain controller but

627
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:16,660
how did I get<font color="#CCCCCC"> their plaintext</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> password</font>

628
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:19,000
so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could set them off because I</font>

629
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:21,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">just ran hash cat for a hundred</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and four</font>

630
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:26,290
minutes and then got everyone's password

631
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:28,299
to his pretty simple setup I used the

632
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:31,809
CentOS 7 box creating a bunch of

633
00:31:28,299 --> 00:31:34,418
accounts that their passwords and then I

634
00:31:31,809 --> 00:31:36,610
was able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to dump all those and wanted to</font>

635
00:31:34,419 --> 00:31:40,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">crack them to see just how much secure</font>

636
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:41,649
eunuch says I<font color="#E5E5E5"> used to say that unix</font>

637
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:44,140
admins were all the old guys with the

638
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:46,750
big beards but then hipsters happen to

639
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:48,100
know everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> has beard I go to</font>

640
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:49,690
meetings<font color="#E5E5E5"> now where I'm the only guy</font>

641
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:53,168
without facial hair it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of bizarre</font>

642
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:55,980
but anyway um obviously I have no

643
00:31:53,169 --> 00:31:59,890
fashion sense this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it gets</font>

644
00:31:55,980 --> 00:32:03,730
so 32,000 different salts<font color="#E5E5E5"> thirty-two</font>

645
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:05,650
thousand times Oh 93 minutes was

646
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:07,990
actually how long it took to crack the

647
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:11,080
production environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> the test account</font>

648
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:14,080
or a test environment was 104 so should

649
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:21,850
take 50,000 hours thirty-two thousand

650
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:24,010
salts times whatever nope so oops so why

651
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:28,389
did it take longer did my microphone

652
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:35,220
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> died now I'm good okay good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Sean</font>

653
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:38,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">your hash so excellent question</font>

654
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:40,600
gentlemen poses what hash was used on

655
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:42,790
the CentOS 7 box when I created all the

656
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:46,120
UNIX counts to be perfectly honest<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

657
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:49,299
care use the default and you bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> up a</font>

658
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:53,110
great point linux in your various<font color="#E5E5E5"> unix</font>

659
00:32:49,299 --> 00:32:58,720
flavors did not decide to stop advancing

660
00:32:53,110 --> 00:33:00,760
the password hash technology in 1999 the

661
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,309
way Microsoft did so every couple of

662
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:04,330
years the<font color="#CCCCCC"> unix platforms moved to</font>

663
00:33:03,309 --> 00:33:07,840
stronger and stronger

664
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:10,240
and the password hash filled in that

665
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:12,309
etsy shadow file<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually includes some</font>

666
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:15,519
notation<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say what kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of hash it is</font>

667
00:33:12,309 --> 00:33:17,519
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the format is so it makes it</font>

668
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:19,659
extensible which is kind of cool

669
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:26,470
something Microsoft could maybe learn

670
00:33:19,659 --> 00:33:30,940
from so how bad was it so we were

671
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:33,370
testing 203,000 passwords per second to

672
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:35,049
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> three killa hashes per second does</font>

673
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:40,029
anybody remember what the number was for

674
00:33:35,049 --> 00:33:44,830
the windows boxes you get 32 32 billion

675
00:33:40,029 --> 00:33:46,870
32 billion so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> 200,000 so it's a</font>

676
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:52,658
<font color="#CCCCCC">little slower yeah in sha 512 answer</font>

677
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:54,279
yeah so<font color="#CCCCCC"> kuda hash cat kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of wimps out</font>

678
00:33:52,659 --> 00:34:01,929
and just as the estimated time is

679
00:33:54,279 --> 00:34:03,159
greater than<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 years but hey I'm one of</font>

680
00:34:01,929 --> 00:34:06,309
those guys that people look at

681
00:34:03,159 --> 00:34:10,030
occasionally and go you're an engineer

682
00:34:06,309 --> 00:34:14,020
aren't you I go yeah oh oh yeah want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

683
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:16,510
point out<font color="#CCCCCC"> two passwords</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were cracked one</font>

684
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:18,719
of them was a user name of a password of

685
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:18,720
a

686
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:30,279
and how long did<font color="#E5E5E5"> I let this one run does</font>

687
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:34,679
it say up here<font color="#E5E5E5"> six days first six days I</font>

688
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:34,679
let it run and it got a equals a

689
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:43,078
<font color="#CCCCCC">Microsoft is awesome so I did the little</font>

690
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:46,810
math fired up as fired up a spreadsheet

691
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:49,119
approximately a million years now i have

692
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:50,529
heard we've got an nvidia 1080 that's

693
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:53,290
coming out real soon it's supposed to be

694
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:59,260
twice<font color="#E5E5E5"> as fast so we may cut it down to</font>

695
00:34:53,290 --> 00:35:01,800
five hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> thousand years yeah so even</font>

696
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:07,060
her active directory domain is now pwned

697
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:13,690
so is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that bad yeah math</font>

698
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:21,279
proves it force which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is awesome yeah</font>

699
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:26,710
exactly exactly which yeah the shop 512

700
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:32,260
is a very strong algorithm and exactly

701
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:34,119
yeah yes exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> windows windows</font>

702
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:39,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">security to unix security is apples to</font>

703
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:41,260
oranges<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah but it's expensive so uh no</font>

704
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:43,599
talk on passwords would be complete

705
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:46,690
without the xkcd cartoon about battery

706
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:53,530
horse staple so it's there if you guys

707
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:57,910
haven't seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and this is one that you</font>

708
00:35:53,530 --> 00:36:00,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">can use for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your management to</font>

709
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:04,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">illustrate the problem you know this is</font>

710
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:06,848
<font color="#E5E5E5">not a new cartoon yeah this isn't</font>

711
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:10,390
something that you know is a really

712
00:36:06,849 --> 00:36:15,099
narrow focus I mean XKCD is one of the

713
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:17,440
more widely read web comics so what

714
00:36:15,099 --> 00:36:20,770
you're asking your your employer to do

715
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:22,300
to change that password policy is really

716
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:25,839
you know it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you're trying to</font>

717
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:30,099
do anything super weird there are comics

718
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:32,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">about it for Pete sakes so how do you</font>

719
00:36:30,099 --> 00:36:34,740
fix it my suggestion pull

720
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:38,220
active directory out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your cuatro de</font>

721
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:40,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">com sign on don't use the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> st. this is</font>

722
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:42,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to sound crazy don't use the same</font>

723
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:47,790
passwords on internet accessible

724
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:50,820
machines and for your critical data so

725
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:52,650
don't use the keys to the kingdom on the

726
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:57,000
same machine that your users are using

727
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:59,490
the open<font color="#E5E5E5"> phishing emails there are ways</font>

728
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,980
you can phrase this that sound I was

729
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:05,040
kidding I was coached that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was being</font>

730
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:09,480
absurd but to be perfectly on it it's

731
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:13,590
what we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know this is this</font>

732
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:15,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea is really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> best pract or is taught</font>

733
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:18,720
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best practice to have few</font>

734
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:22,020
passwords but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in reality it makes things</font>

735
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:25,830
so much<font color="#CCCCCC"> easier for the adversary so my</font>

736
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:29,520
suggestion 15 or more characters 17 is

737
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:33,000
better you can literally you know use my

738
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:36,750
numbers 34 billion guesses per second

739
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,910
and then whip it up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Excel so if</font>

740
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:42,390
you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got you know uppercase lowercase</font>

741
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:47,310
in numbers that's 26 plus 26 plus 10

742
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:50,069
which is 62 and then you let's see what

743
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:52,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">is it then your exponent is the number</font>

744
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:55,950
of characters<font color="#CCCCCC"> or the exponents the base</font>

745
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:57,210
and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> help me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out so if you want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

746
00:37:55,950 --> 00:38:04,700
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how many possible passwords</font>

747
00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:04,700
you have what's up exponent so you take

748
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:10,310
yep so you've got 62 possible characters

749
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:13,319
upper case lower case of numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

750
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:16,710
then your exponent is your number of

751
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:19,940
digits so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you take 60 to raise it to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

752
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:23,430
15th power raise<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to the 17th power</font>

753
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:26,100
divided it by 34 billion guesses per

754
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:31,319
second<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's how long it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> takes to</font>

755
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:33,180
crack your those passwords or go 60

756
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:35,430
billion password guesses per second if

757
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:39,120
you're using the Nvidia 1080s that come

758
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:43,649
out in a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my suggestion</font>

759
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:46,350
long passwords allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> English words this</font>

760
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:48,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">is where your auditors will I probably</font>

761
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:52,410
can't say shit bricks this is where your

762
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:58,770
auditors will push back but if you show

763
00:38:52,410 --> 00:39:02,160
them the math this will<font color="#E5E5E5"> work if not get</font>

764
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:05,009
it in writing put a liability clause on

765
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:07,649
there ask your auditors ask those people

766
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:10,080
that deal with the auditors to<font color="#CCCCCC"> put it in</font>

767
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:13,620
writing that they would rather you have

768
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:17,130
a short easily cracked easily guest

769
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:19,130
password then one that's long secure but

770
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:21,630
happens to have english words in it

771
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:29,070
you're not going to get an auditor to do

772
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:30,810
that so um the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> time I gave this</font>

773
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:33,510
presentation I was coached that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I gave I</font>

774
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:38,880
went too fast I tried to slow it down

775
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:41,100
today but apparently I'm all done before

776
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">I go to questions I will say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my team is</font>

777
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:46,140
hiring ideally I would have a link to

778
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">our website</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> set but they won't let me</font>

779
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:53,790
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> that on there hit me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up after the</font>

780
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:55,470
presentation hit me<font color="#CCCCCC"> up on gmail if you</font>

781
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:57,480
guys can't social engineer and figure

782
00:39:55,470 --> 00:40:03,000
out who my employer is I would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

783
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:07,440
probably not my ideal candidate let's be

784
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:12,060
honest here so yeah hit<font color="#CCCCCC"> me up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I am on</font>

785
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:16,130
linkedin and feel free<font color="#CCCCCC"> to let me know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

786
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:20,390
you're interested so questions yeah

787
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:20,390
start with first or second<font color="#E5E5E5"> or oh yeah</font>

788
00:40:39,930 --> 00:41:07,690
talk about you talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about like telnet</font>

789
00:40:48,010 --> 00:41:08,970
FTP sure yep yep<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so the</font>

790
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:13,270
gentleman's question was about

791
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:16,600
mitigating the risk of using protocols

792
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:20,380
with plaintext passwords at the

793
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:22,779
transport layer so something like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> maps</font>

794
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:26,230
something like pop3 something like FTP

795
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:28,300
something like that I will say this is

796
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:31,150
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one where you really get into the</font>

797
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:32,530
service account conversation as well the

798
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:34,720
service accounts tend to be high

799
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:36,940
privileged the passwords don't change

800
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:40,629
and they're used for<font color="#E5E5E5"> ftp ting files back</font>

801
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:47,230
and forth so really<font color="#E5E5E5"> no concerns there</font>

802
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:49,120
they're perfectly fine with those you

803
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:54,370
know how do you mitigate that risk my

804
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:57,220
answer would just be what can you do at

805
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:58,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">the network level switch networks of</font>

806
00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:01,899
course helped a little we all know this

807
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:06,310
can be easily defeated the other thing I

808
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:08,740
would look about look at in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> windows</font>

809
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:11,950
environment so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to address</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

810
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:13,540
to the general<font color="#CCCCCC"> audience in a Windows</font>

811
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:16,419
Windows environment we've got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows</font>

812
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:18,820
client talking to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows Server the</font>

813
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:20,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">Windows Firewall can come to play how</font>

814
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:27,190
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the Windows Firewall</font>

815
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:31,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">sucks yes cool that means</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I get to</font>

816
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:33,010
educate you yeah so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first version of</font>

817
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:34,380
the windows firewall that came out with

818
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:39,840
what is it windows

819
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:45,450
XP sp2 was the first version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

820
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:49,710
firewall the first oh so let's just say

821
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:51,950
XP ish<font color="#E5E5E5"> SART it was really bad it really</font>

822
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:54,270
opened up the door<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the semantics the</font>

823
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:56,700
microscope ease of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world to create</font>

824
00:42:54,270 --> 00:43:01,170
ad on firewalls and charge you money<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

825
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:03,089
them yay for vendors but the next

826
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:05,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">version of the Windows Firewall Windows</font>

827
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:07,520
Firewall with advanced security actually

828
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:10,980
does some really really cool things if

829
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:14,220
you have an ad environment you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can tie</font>

830
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:17,610
your Windows Firewall with advanced

831
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:21,089
security into<font color="#E5E5E5"> group policy and then make</font>

832
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:23,610
it talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your CA so now your Microsoft</font>

833
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:27,720
certificate authority can push down keys

834
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:30,120
to all your clients and your firewall

835
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:32,879
can be configured so that if it's

836
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:35,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking to a particular server I don't</font>

837
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:40,320
know the ftp server on oh I don't know

838
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:44,580
the FTP protocol to force encryption

839
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:46,770
using IPSec at the network layer your

840
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:48,840
protocols in your upper level

841
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:52,440
applications have no idea this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

842
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:57,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">on underneath how many people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think your</font>

843
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:59,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">Windows Firewall sucks now you all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

844
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:59,480
smarter

845
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:17,540
yep there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of tuning required</font>

846
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:23,230
with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> windows fire yeah agreed</font>

847
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:26,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">wholeheartedly yeah oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah so um</font>

848
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:28,280
the I'm going to do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick plug for</font>

windows security with Jason<font color="#CCCCCC"> Fossen if</font>

851
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:35,540
you have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> opportunity i know the</font>

852
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:40,729
sands classes are a little more pricey

853
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:42,369
than besides but and if you get the

854
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:45,140
opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take it with Jason</font>

855
00:44:42,369 --> 00:44:49,359
excellent instructor and fantastic

856
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:49,359
material it really opened my eyes up to

857
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:55,040
how little window sucks now it's gotten

858
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:57,229
a whole lot better the other thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

859
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:59,720
will say if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you happen to attend one of</font>

860
00:44:57,230 --> 00:45:02,359
the sands conferences and Jason does his

861
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:05,598
sands at night talk on<font color="#CCCCCC"> windows security</font>

862
00:45:02,359 --> 00:45:07,609
go it's usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> scheduled for like an</font>

863
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:10,460
hour and they usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> give them the 8 to</font>

864
00:45:07,609 --> 00:45:13,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">9 p.m. slot go have a big meal</font>

865
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:15,560
beforehand maybe grab a frosty beverage

866
00:45:13,339 --> 00:45:18,020
and get in a comfortable chair<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

867
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:21,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jason will talk and drink and drink and</font>

868
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:25,400
talk until midnight and he's fascinating

869
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:27,470
you will learn a lot but<font color="#E5E5E5"> a drunk Jason</font>

870
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:32,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">Fossen is a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of fun</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok other</font>

871
00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:37,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">questions ya know so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question was</font>

872
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:40,750
did we<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> FPGAs and the reason i</font>

873
00:45:37,339 --> 00:45:43,339
used brute force is because it was slow

874
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:45,830
the point of the presentation and the

875
00:45:43,339 --> 00:45:48,650
way i started this talk off was that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

876
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:50,390
am going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to present you with math that</font>

877
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:53,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">shows</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that our 30-day password</font>

878
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:56,180
expiration is sufficient<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

879
00:45:53,089 --> 00:45:58,640
did is<font color="#CCCCCC"> i let the you know my team call</font>

880
00:45:56,180 --> 00:46:01,368
out and just pick apart my credibility

881
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:04,060
throughout the entire presentation so by

882
00:46:01,369 --> 00:46:06,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">the time i was done there was no way yes</font>

883
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:09,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">fpgas would be a whole lot faster the</font>

884
00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:10,700
other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> you moving to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hybrid attacks</font>

885
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,339
dictionary attack stuff like that would

886
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:15,200
definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> get you a whole lot faster</font>

887
00:46:12,339 --> 00:46:18,980
the other thing if you don't have two

888
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:21,740
grand to drop on nine ATT ice imagine

889
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:26,660
that AWS

890
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:28,819
you can get AWS instances with nvidia

891
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:34,460
cards in them<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe they're</font>

892
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:37,190
equivalent to a Titan<font color="#E5E5E5"> X so my 93 minutes</font>

893
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:40,880
maybe two or three<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours and i think i</font>

894
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:43,700
did the math I'll tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys it was I</font>

895
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:46,550
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say under fifty dollars in AWS</font>

896
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:50,270
charges so the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of damage</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

897
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:51,710
do for you know hopefully your company

898
00:46:50,270 --> 00:46:54,110
would support you spending fifty dollars

899
00:46:51,710 --> 00:47:01,240
on AWS to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to prove this out to</font>

900
00:46:54,110 --> 00:47:01,240
you guys yeah sure

901
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:22,420
does it store

902
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:33,230
so the gentleman's question was if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

903
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:37,500
disable all windows authentication

904
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:39,210
techniques other than ntlm be<font color="#CCCCCC"> two will</font>

905
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:42,660
it still store those other password

906
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:44,190
hashes in memory and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I must</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I look</font>

907
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:47,600
forward to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your talk next year where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

908
00:47:44,190 --> 00:47:47,600
present<font color="#E5E5E5"> the results of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> research</font>

909
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:56,900
yeah

910
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:07,170
to be my suggestion grab mini cats get

911
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:09,300
the latest version<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dump memory from</font>

912
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:20,460
not a domain controller but just a

913
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:25,680
little laptop and see what you get sure

914
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:27,240
oh yeah but yeah so gentlemen points out

915
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:30,359
that there are websites you can go to

916
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:31,979
and plug in hashes tell what the

917
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:35,490
algorithm was and then it can spit back

918
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:38,790
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> plain text while equivalents I</font>

919
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:59,250
thought about using one of those but 398

920
00:48:38,790 --> 00:49:04,670
eTI's yeah and that agrees with what I

921
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:04,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">was thinking okay</font>

922
00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:13,549
hey I get married yeah sure

923
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:26,589
so to mitigate the ntlm hashes going

924
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:28,510
across the network what you're hinting

925
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:46,980
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm guessing is the past the hashtag</font>

926
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:49,420
type attack right right so sure the

927
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:51,910
research was<font color="#E5E5E5"> predicated on the</font>

928
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:55,240
assumption of an attack traditional

929
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:58,720
fishing style attack user get or the

930
00:49:55,240 --> 00:50:01,060
adversary gets commit remote control

931
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:03,009
remote command execution on a end-users

932
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:05,080
laptop is then able to escalate

933
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:08,920
privileges jump to domain get domain

934
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:10,150
privilege domain admin and then then

935
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:11,740
you're able to access volume shadow

936
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:15,720
copies get a copy of the data you need

937
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:21,009
you're off to the races to have question

938
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:26,580
no you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay anybody in the wings go</font>

939
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:26,580
for it sure

940
00:50:28,900 --> 00:51:18,730
in this and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's quote for</font>

941
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:21,189
those that couldn't hear the question

942
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:23,340
was about if you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially an</font>

943
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:26,130
uncrackable password using a strong is

944
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:29,170
stored with a strong hashing algorithm

945
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:31,930
that's nice and long why would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you ever</font>

946
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:35,080
for so password change and gentlemen the

947
00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:37,180
audience points out that that user is

948
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:39,880
likely to reuse that same password on

949
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:42,040
another site and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember our list</font>

950
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:45,010
of 40 other sites that our users have

951
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:47,560
passwords for so chances are one of them

952
00:51:45,010 --> 00:51:49,480
does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> use a strong password other</font>

953
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:53,980
chances are one of them is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get</font>

954
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:58,570
popped so to me that still falls into

955
00:51:53,980 --> 00:52:01,990
good security hygiene there may<font color="#CCCCCC"> not be a</font>

956
00:51:58,570 --> 00:52:05,470
mathematical reason for it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will say it</font>

957
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:08,379
also forces for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the user that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

958
00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:10,540
mindset it lets them know that your

959
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:12,880
central IT group your central security

960
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:15,160
group can't do all the security for them

961
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:17,650
that the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> user still has to do a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

962
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:20,620
of it and so by forcing those periodic

963
00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:25,800
password changes that reminds the user

964
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:29,759
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they still play a part as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well ok</font>

965
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:32,590
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> about out of time I must say I am</font>

966
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:36,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">absolutely floored that this many people</font>

967
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:40,150
stuck around for the coveted 5 p.m. slot

968
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:43,410
on Cincinnati besides 2016 so thank you

969
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:43,410
all very very much oh really
