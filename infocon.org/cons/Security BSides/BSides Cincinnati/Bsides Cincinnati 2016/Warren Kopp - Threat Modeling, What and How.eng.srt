<font color="#CCCCCC">am again big thanks to the organizers I</font>

59
00:06:49,219 --> 00:06:51,770
have a little bit of insight of what it

60
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:53,599
takes to put this kind of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

61
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:55,248
together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a fantastic event</font>

62
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,919
they've all worked very hard for us to

63
00:06:55,249 --> 00:07:05,689
get here for<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost nothing so big hand</font>

64
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:08,120
of applause for them and so Who am I I'm

65
00:07:05,689 --> 00:07:10,550
an application<font color="#CCCCCC"> security specialist we</font>

66
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:13,479
don't abbreviate that one by the way I

67
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:17,149
work for a fairly<font color="#E5E5E5"> large software company</font>

68
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:19,099
our product is over 20 years old and in

69
00:07:17,149 --> 00:07:20,689
the last three is when we've really

70
00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:22,490
started to take application security

71
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:23,869
seriously so there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

72
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:25,580
implications with that there's a lot of

73
00:07:23,869 --> 00:07:27,319
security debt there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of learning</font>

74
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,149
as we go there's a lot of looking at the

75
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:32,749
bad habits we've built up<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the years</font>

76
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:34,909
and what we've done with that so with

77
00:07:32,749 --> 00:07:36,889
that security debt is where my talk

78
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:38,479
comes in about threat modeling I'm going

79
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:40,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go into the more specifics about that</font>

80
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,930
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of what I've been doing is</font>

81
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:43,969
teaching I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> teaching security to</font>

82
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:45,559
people who don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know haven't done it or</font>

83
00:07:43,969 --> 00:07:48,319
don't care about security and why it

84
00:07:45,559 --> 00:07:50,300
matters to their jobs it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just the</font>

85
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,159
developers it's not just the QA testers

86
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,990
it's the sales the installation the

87
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:55,998
support everyone is involved in the

88
00:07:53,990 --> 00:08:00,229
security of our product<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they all</font>

89
00:07:55,999 --> 00:08:02,209
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to learn from different levels so</font>

90
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:04,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">before I break into threat modeling and</font>

91
00:08:02,209 --> 00:08:05,090
why I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that matters to everybody</font>

92
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:07,460
infrastructure

93
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:10,099
or software whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to go over a</font>

94
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:12,198
basic concept as anybody read this book

95
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:14,979
or have an idea where I'm going with

96
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:17,840
this this is rubber duck debugging and

97
00:08:14,979 --> 00:08:20,270
the way the story goes paraphrased and

98
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,010
shortened is that there's two

99
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:24,349
programmers working at a company young

100
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:25,880
one in a wise old programmer and the

101
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:27,919
young one comes up to the old program

102
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:30,290
Ernie says<font color="#E5E5E5"> ah I've got this problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

103
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,059
stuck I have no<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea what to do here's</font>

104
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:34,339
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things I've tried I'm just lost I</font>

105
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:35,989
don't know what's happening next the old

106
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:37,400
programmer looks at him<font color="#E5E5E5"> he nods he</font>

107
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:40,339
scratches his beard and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you point to the</font>

108
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:42,049
corner and<font color="#CCCCCC"> he sees a duck he says what</font>

109
00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:45,830
am<font color="#CCCCCC"> I doing with this duck he says go</font>

110
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:48,949
over there calmly slowly explain your

111
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:50,839
problem to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> duck walk through it step</font>

112
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:53,330
by step as if you are explaining

113
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:55,160
programming to a duck the young

114
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:57,440
programmer thinks the<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy's crazy he</font>

115
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,120
gives him the dirty look but he's older

116
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,740
than he is he's wiser he knows the way

117
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,089
of the things he goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> over there and he</font>

118
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:04,610
started talking to the duck and<font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font>

119
00:09:02,089 --> 00:09:05,839
explains his problem he gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

120
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:08,089
two-thirds<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the way through and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font>

121
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:11,779
stopped short he looks over at the wise

122
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:14,839
old programmer and he says that's it he

123
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:16,880
goes that's right he fixed his problem

124
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:18,830
by slowly and carefully explaining it

125
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,110
walking through his processes and seeing

126
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:27,080
what didn't make sense what he had gone

127
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:29,720
wrong where he was going so great lovely

128
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:34,190
story that was awesome you tell it so

129
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:36,110
well what's happening here threat

130
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:38,420
modeling is a concept that was started

131
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:40,430
so far as I'm aware by the security team

132
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:43,099
at Microsoft right around the time of XP

133
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:45,560
service pack 1 now those dates differ

134
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:48,050
who claims<font color="#E5E5E5"> fame to it differ things go</font>

135
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,489
back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> forth that's not the important</font>

136
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:51,680
part the important part is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the process</font>

137
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:54,020
and what's it mean it can be any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

138
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,810
these things but it's not it's super

139
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:59,120
simple it's a conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font>

140
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:01,189
conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a process where I've</font>

141
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">seen it the most is in software you're</font>

142
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:04,610

the security<font color="#E5E5E5"> fit into that what happens</font>

00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:14,089
with things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that matter in terms of</font>

security it's all about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> process of</font>

148
00:10:14,089 --> 00:10:18,649
getting outside of your own head having

149
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:23,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">that conversation with other people too</font>

150
00:10:18,649 --> 00:10:25,309
understand what's happening so I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

151
00:10:23,569 --> 00:10:28,040
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what I do with software</font>

152
00:10:25,309 --> 00:10:30,649
this is generally the<font color="#E5E5E5"> software</font>

153
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,740
development<font color="#E5E5E5"> lifecycle you take</font>

154
00:10:30,649 --> 00:10:35,029
requirements you put a design together

155
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:37,730
you spend a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of time implementing</font>

156
00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:40,069
that you verify it you test it you make

157
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:42,529
sure it hits those things and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

158
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:44,569
release it out into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wild when you</font>

159
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:46,790
build security into that process it's

160
00:10:44,569 --> 00:10:50,209
not just another bullet point on this

161
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:52,730
list it has to come<font color="#CCCCCC"> in at every</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stage of</font>

162
00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:54,319
that and the software development

163
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:55,939
process isn't much different than the

164
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:57,800
things I've seen for infrastructure or

165
00:10:55,939 --> 00:10:59,660
anything like that where you have these

166
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,368
steps you have to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at what the goals</font>

167
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:03,618
are you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at how you can meet</font>

168
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:05,990
those goals and the budget<font color="#CCCCCC"> and put them</font>

169
00:11:03,619 --> 00:11:07,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">together but when you add this to turn</font>

170
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:09,980
it into a security development life

171
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:12,559
cycle as we call it you add these two

172
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:14,360
things up front you have training where

173
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:16,519
you learn about the problems that can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

174
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,769
presented you learn about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the solutions</font>

175
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:20,749
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can prevent those problems and then</font>

176
00:11:18,769 --> 00:11:22,490
you have the response where you take

177
00:11:20,749 --> 00:11:24,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">responsibility for what you've put out</font>

178
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:27,319
there at my company that's a matter of

179
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:29,300
keeping track of our vulnerabilities we

180
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:31,128
know we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems in our software it</font>

181
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,469
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not one hundred percent effective or</font>

182
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:35,329
secure we have to track those and we

183
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:37,370
communicate particularly security

184
00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:40,128
vulnerabilities honestly with<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

185
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:41,689
customers we keep a list monthly we

186
00:11:40,129 --> 00:11:42,949
publish a bulletin that says here<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

187
00:11:41,689 --> 00:11:44,899
the things we've addressed in all these

188
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:46,998
updates here's why it's important for

189
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:50,420
you to update we're keeping that honest

190
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:52,160
conversation alive and to do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

191
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:53,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to inject security at every point</font>

192
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,839
so we're finding those vulnerabilities

193
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:58,879
before we release after we release when

194
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:00,559
they're reported by other people there

195
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:02,600
are so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who have our software</font>

196
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:04,490
that our software is included in scopes

197
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,889
that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not paying for for a pen test</font>

198
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:08,480
we get pen test reports every month from

199
00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:12,230
customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> who have included our stuff</font>

200
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:14,360
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> sadly we learn about vulnerabilities</font>

201
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:16,100
that way and now we look awkward in

202
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,990
front of the customer going I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

203
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,699
why that happens I don't know when we're

204
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:20,869
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get it fixed but we have that</font>

205
00:12:19,699 --> 00:12:25,219
support structure to have that

206
00:12:20,869 --> 00:12:27,860
conversation and where we see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

207
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:30,319
value injecting into all those stages is

208
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:31,970
threat modeling it's a conversation<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

209
00:12:30,319 --> 00:12:33,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">get some people in the room</font>

210
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:36,949
walk through a process you make some

211
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:40,040
diagrams you look for gaps what you're

212
00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:42,740
doing is defining things of value what

213
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:45,349
matters in this process what matters in

214
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:47,000
this implementation what matters in what

215
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:50,329
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here in this particular</font>

216
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,550
area then you look at the potential are

217
00:12:50,329 --> 00:12:54,739
you taking user data are you storing

218
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:57,290
user data what are you doing to process

219
00:12:54,740 --> 00:13:00,769
that data is it data at<font color="#E5E5E5"> all maybe you're</font>

220
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:03,199
doing something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else then you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look at</font>

221
00:13:00,769 --> 00:13:05,930
the threats what<font color="#E5E5E5"> possibly can happen</font>

222
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:07,609
here that's a hard thing to do sometimes

223
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:09,229
sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's really hard to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get people</font>

224
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:11,000
who haven't ever looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the threat</font>

225
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:13,250
side of it to understand there even are

226
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,149
threats but then you have to build<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

227
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:19,129
that vocabulary to apply them and then

228
00:13:17,149 --> 00:13:20,509
finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's the countermeasures what</font>

229
00:13:19,129 --> 00:13:22,810
are you doing to prevent those threats

230
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:24,860
from becoming problems risks

231
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:26,930
vulnerabilities and the software what

232
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:32,240
are you trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look ahead and stop</font>

233
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:34,609
bad things from happening with so how do

234
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">we take these pieces of a thing you have</font>

235
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:40,660
raw materials you have ideas and turn

236
00:13:37,069 --> 00:13:43,189
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a finished stable process a</font>

237
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:46,189
secure thing something you trust and

238
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:52,219
understand without it<font color="#E5E5E5"> turning into this</font>

239
00:13:46,189 --> 00:13:53,509
or this everybody at work not told me

240
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,189
not to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one but I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like that's</font>

241
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:59,059
official marketing I didn't put that on

242
00:13:55,189 --> 00:14:01,219
the internet so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it all starts with a</font>

243
00:13:59,059 --> 00:14:03,050
drawing everybody's seen this meme right

244
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:07,009
draw some circles draw the rest of the

245
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:09,079
owl well when you're doing threat

246
00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:10,430
modeling and we open up when we're

247
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:11,420
talking to these groups of people we're

248
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:13,459
saying first you're going to have to

249
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:15,410
draw a diagram half the room starts

250
00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:17,209
making eyes they roll our eyes think I

251
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:19,339
don't know how to draw I can't draw

252
00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:21,500
unlike guys we didn't hire<font color="#CCCCCC"> you for</font>

253
00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:23,180
drawing this is software organization we

254
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:26,420
hired<font color="#E5E5E5"> you for your ability to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think and</font>

255
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:28,339
analyze things critically so you don't

256
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:32,870
have to get too wrapped up in what are

257
00:14:28,339 --> 00:14:34,850
you drawing<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the basics at the top</font>

258
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:37,430
level you start with entities and

259
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:39,170
processes just different symbols to

260
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:41,209
denote different things are happening

261
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:43,399
entities transmit data to and from

262
00:14:41,209 --> 00:14:44,949
processes that interact with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that data</font>

263
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:48,850
and may or may not send it to

264
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:51,430
data store data stores represent data at

265
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:53,860
rest entities are something usually

266
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:55,689
outside of your control and processes

267
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:58,120
are the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> control you</font>

268
00:14:55,690 --> 00:15:01,050
can modify<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're designing or you're</font>

269
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:04,660
altering to make something<font color="#E5E5E5"> more secure</font>

270
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:06,510
next you draw paths not really like this

271
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:09,310
more like just a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple of arrows</font>

272
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:11,950
curving to and from a piece of your

273
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:14,709
diagram so you have an entity<font color="#CCCCCC"> that sends</font>

274
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:19,270
data in this direction and it comes back

275
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:21,280
through this direction<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

276
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:22,900
data flows going to and from<font color="#CCCCCC"> entities</font>

277
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:25,689
the next thing you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is chart</font>

278
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:28,030
specifics what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the format of things</font>

279
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:30,940
that are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> back and forth is it HTTP</font>

280
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:34,120
traffic is a TCP traffic what is it

281
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:36,520
contain does it contain forum posts

282
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,800
sequel data authentication tokens

283
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:40,390
retrieval anything like that you're

284
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,859
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the specifics of what is</font>

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:54,310
mitigations ideas of what's happening so

290
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:56,500
how does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that look you draw an entity</font>

291
00:15:54,310 --> 00:16:00,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">that sends data somewhere down the line</font>

292
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:03,100
to a process by following data flows and

293
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:04,930
eventually ends up in a data store this

294
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:07,420
is all the more<font color="#E5E5E5"> complicated your diagram</font>

295
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:09,130
really has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one more small</font>

296
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:11,740
step but this is what you're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

297
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:14,110
and I've seen this define infrastructure

298
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:17,950
I've seen it define high-level code

299
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:20,260
low-level code because it's a thing

300
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:22,480
moving between another thing it's super

301
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:24,040
simple and it's the context<font color="#CCCCCC"> that matters</font>

302
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,790
the specifics that you have in that

303
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:30,849
conversation and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> the final part of</font>

304
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:33,030
the diagram is a trust boundary you draw

305
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:37,870
a line around the things that you know

306
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:39,850
matter and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> in turn makes an outside</font>

307
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:42,340
the entity here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is stuff you don't trust</font>

308
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:44,950
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> number one way we communicate this</font>

309
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:46,690
with our software developers is well we

310
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:48,640
receive things from a client and they go

311
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:51,250
yeah we trust the client<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I said no</font>

312
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:54,069
we wrote the client we do not trust the

313
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:56,980
client it exists outside of our control

314
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:58,390
either outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the network when it's</font>

315
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,970
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet facing thing</font>

316
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:02,890
or still on a user workstation because

317
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:05,800
it transmits simple things across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

318
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:08,170
wire<font color="#CCCCCC"> like HTTP anything can do that and</font>

319
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,909
then we break into demos to explain that

320
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:11,890
because a lot of them don't understand

321
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:13,959
or haven't thought enough to know you

322
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:15,910
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just drop</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> burp fiddler something</font>

323
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:17,829
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that on the line watch what's going</font>

324
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:22,240
back and forth and modify it in real

325
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:24,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">time and then inside the trust boundary</font>

326
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,470
though those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things somewhere</font>

327
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:28,840
there's going to be a system of record

328
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:30,490
or the trust anchor our software that's

329
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:32,320
the database if we can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust the</font>

330
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:34,630
database we can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust anything and all</font>

331
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,310
of our mitigations don't matter now

332
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:37,870
depending on<font color="#E5E5E5"> what your modeling this</font>

333
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:40,000
might be a different<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing maybe it's</font>

334
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:42,040
that process maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to trust</font>

335
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">that and after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the compromises are</font>

336
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,100
some other level in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the diagram that</font>

337
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:47,710
you're not dealing with it that

338
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:50,740
particular time but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the trust</font>

339
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:52,510
anchor where your protections where your

340
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:54,160
mitigations where your interactions

341
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:55,480
that's where it all matters you want to

342
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,310
make sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going into that</font>

343
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,350
point or what's coming out of that point

344
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:01,090
is the thing that you trust so

345
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:06,760
everything there treats the data on its

346
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:10,120
way in and<font color="#E5E5E5"> out so every system is built</font>

00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:13,270
on assumptions networks interaction

00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:18,669
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this in a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whiteboard so we'll have</font>

351
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:20,830
our data flow somewhere in the middle

352
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:22,690
and then off to one side will have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

353
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:25,090
list that<font color="#E5E5E5"> says assumptions we are</font>

assuming an authenticated session we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

355
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:29,980
assuming the user has authorization to

these<font color="#E5E5E5"> three things that matter to this</font>

00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:35,290
assuming that isn't captured in that

00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,840
diagram that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to need later</font>

360
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:39,610
when you're verifying everything are you

361
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,740
only having encrypted communications

362
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:43,959
that matters because<font color="#E5E5E5"> then man in the</font>

363
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:46,420
middle is a different problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you</font>

364
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:48,880
only using authenticated users great

365
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:50,620
that's wonderful for that conversation

366
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:54,700
but later you're going to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

367
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:56,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and verify that this list is the</font>

368
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,930
first thing that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to become an</font>

369
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:01,419
artifact afterwards that you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">have to do some work with someone or</font>

list and verify those assumptions in

relationship to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> process so just to</font>

374
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:15,879
review you've got endpoints

375
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:17,740
you've got paths they talk to one

376
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:20,140
another back and forth they send certain

377
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:23,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">specific pieces of data for the process</font>

378
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:27,220
you're involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in you draw a boundary</font>

379
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:29,409
and you write down assumptions this is

380
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:31,419
all the harder the actual modeling part

381
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:33,760
is all the difficult parts after this

382
00:19:31,419 --> 00:19:36,010
come from the discussion what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

383
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,020
process do what data does it take in

00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:39,850
what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it due to it on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way in or</font>

385
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:45,100
out and what happens and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what are the</font>

386
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:49,299
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> implications of that so is that</font>

387
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:51,610
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely not that's just the basics</font>

388
00:19:49,299 --> 00:19:53,110
the you're drawing a diagram your move

389
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:55,449
you're following the path of what's

390
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:57,969
happening through a system and you're

391
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:59,620
writing down your assumptions from here

392
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:01,510
comes what I consider<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fun part</font>

393
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:03,219
because I go to places like this to

394
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:05,740
learn from people who don't do blue team

395
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:07,480
who don't do application stuff who do

396
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:10,750
the attack who learn the pen testing

397
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:13,870
things now you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find your threats</font>

398
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:16,210
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to imagine what matters to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

399
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:18,209
process you're doing are you modeling a

00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:21,100
network process are you worried about

00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:22,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">Network threats are you building a new</font>

404
00:20:25,059 --> 00:20:30,190
about nature our floods our concern what

405
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,080
can you do there you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

406
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:34,240
specific with your threats and your

407
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,939
threat actors of what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to happen</font>

408
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,919
with our software we can be concerned

409
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:40,900
about all that<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff but the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> person</font>

410
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:43,000
we're most concerned about is some<font color="#CCCCCC"> bored</font>

411
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:45,220
user who's trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to either do his job</font>

412
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,720
quicker to meet a quota or is bored

413
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:50,710
enough just to test the<font color="#CCCCCC"> limits of the</font>

414
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:52,870
system<font color="#E5E5E5"> the specifics of that matter to</font>

415
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:55,000
us because that's the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> dangerous</font>

416
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:57,969
thing if people breach our customers

417
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,580
that's fine but<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reputation is on the</font>

418
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:08,460
line if someone circumvents the security

419
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:11,199
controls we sold them in our software so

420
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:14,470
again it's important to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be specific</font>

421
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,210
about your threat actors are you worried

422
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:18,250
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone who doesn't know how to</font>

423
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:20,980
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> the system are you worried about</font>

424
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:23,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone maliciously targeting whatever's</font>

425
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:25,510
out there doing things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they've</font>

426
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:28,590
learned<font color="#E5E5E5"> either from</font>

427
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:31,510
exploit kits from watching con talks are

428
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:34,149
you worried about fires are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you worried</font>

429
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:37,780
about acts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> God interrupting your</font>

430
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:39,550
services so once you've determined that

431
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:42,010
threat actor so in our case it's the

432
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:44,230
board user what are you worried about

433
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:46,330
they what are you worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they can</font>

434
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:48,700
do to your system are you worried about

435
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:50,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">them dumping your database finding all</font>

436
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:52,750
your customer data finding all your

437
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:55,120
sensitive data are you worried about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

438
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:58,330

439
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:01,540
passwords a<font color="#CCCCCC"> three-character</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> password who</font>

440
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:03,460
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem there are</font>

441
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:05,110
mitigations these things exist in the

442
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:07,260
real world are you worried about

443
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:10,419
anonymous or network attacks someone

444
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:13,060
kicking you off the internet if you can

445
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:15,160
list these specific things it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

446
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:17,230
easy to come up with specific solutions

447
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:19,690
to them if you're just worried about

448
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:22,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">having more security that can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

449
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:24,130
anything it's super easy to get generic

450
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,020
with this stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and just hand wave it</font>

451
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:28,390
the point of the threat modeling process

452
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:30,879
is to get in there deeper to get those

453
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:32,830
specifics out to write them down so that

454
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,110
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that record afterwards to go</font>

455
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:39,790
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are we doing in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this system how are</font>

456
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:43,120
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that where are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that so</font>

457
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:44,950
I writing this I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that's great</font>

458
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,520
what have<font color="#E5E5E5"> we done to prompt people with</font>

459
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:50,860
it so I came<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with questions</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like this</font>

460
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,870
what has made you mad people support

461
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:54,790
things all the time if you're doing this

462
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:57,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">for a system that exists look at your</font>

463
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:59,159
backlog what<font color="#CCCCCC"> causes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

464
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:01,660
reactions what are you concerned about

465
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:03,790
we have a thing we call<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tax service</font>

466
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:06,940
reduction it's super hard to explain to

467
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:09,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">developers or it was and then I did the</font>

468
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:12,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">math</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'm like okay every</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> process has</font>

469
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:14,830
compromises right they all oh yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> super</font>

470
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:16,900
when the CTO comes in and says we have

471
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:20,800
to ship this thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> next month what do</font>

472
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:22,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">you cut out there like whoa nobody wants</font>

473
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,669
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you I'm like this is what that</font>

474
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:28,210
list is for we know there are shortcuts

475
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:30,190
that have taken security less seriously

476
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:32,950
let's put it that way not skipped

477
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:35,740
security not passed over that but

478
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:38,140
they've taken that less of as less of a

479
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:38,800
priority than the features and getting

480
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:41,290
them in customer

481
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:43,210
hands we want to list those things we

482
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:44,980
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep track of that so that when</font>

483
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:47,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">people have those projects and they say</font>

484
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:49,000
well what do you really<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to do we</font>

485
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:51,100
can go oh we got this list how much time

486
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">you got we have 400</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things here that we</font>

487
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:54,520
know we can fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are either</font>

488
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">low-hanging or super corner case</font>

489
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:58,270
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that maybe nobody</font>

490
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:59,830
will ever<font color="#CCCCCC"> find but we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it</font>

491
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:03,070
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the best thing we</font>

492
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:08,590
can sell so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't have that list</font>

493
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:11,080
we can't have that presentation specific

494
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:13,990
health going back specific threats

495
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:15,760
result in specific mitigations what can

496
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:18,100
you do to stop it what can you do to

497
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,590
slow it down Liam was talking about the

498
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:22,600
time to exploit in things no<font color="#CCCCCC"> one system</font>

499
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:24,669
is perfect<font color="#CCCCCC"> no one system will be perfect</font>

500
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,350
but if you have those specific threats

501
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:28,540
from specific threat actors you're

502
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:30,340
worried about now you can backtrack to

503
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:32,440
what would stop them what would slow

504
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:36,159
them down what would<font color="#E5E5E5"> change the</font>

505
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:37,900
interaction is it just implementing

506
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,970
change control in a system so you know

507
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:42,340
what happened sometimes that's a big

508
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:45,460
deal is it stricter is it different

509
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:47,919
authorization strict output encoding

510
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:49,750
that's a big one at my job redundant

511
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,610
backups redundant networks it can be

512
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:54,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">something very specific because you've</font>

513
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:56,860
outlined that specific threat if this

514
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:58,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">isn't a design phase exercise but you're</font>

515
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:00,580
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to analyze something that already</font>

516
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:03,250
exists sometimes you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to learn to</font>

517
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:05,530
see things differently again Liam had

518
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:07,450
incredible examples with bro and ids and

519
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:10,570
things like that of getting in there and

520
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:12,460
analyzing stuff sometimes you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

521
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:14,080
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem might be but you can</font>

522
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:15,940
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at where you think it would be and</font>

523
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:19,090
then back that out are you worried about

524
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:21,580
specific problems like data exfiltration

525
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:23,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay what are the common ways people do</font>

526
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:24,850
that things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can get in</font>

527
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,680
there and gain that<font color="#E5E5E5"> change of</font>

528
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:30,820
perspective find that new thing to look

529
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:34,450
at and here again<font color="#E5E5E5"> are questions to get</font>

530
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:37,060
those ideas flowing what can you change

531
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:38,620
what can you resign out of the system we

532
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:40,210
did this with a new team not too long

533
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:42,040
ago and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they had a prospective feature</font>

534
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:43,750
up and they're like well and then we do

535
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">the authentication but we send it off to</font>

536
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">this third party thing and then they</font>

537
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">come back and then we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take that in</font>

538
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:50,889
but we send it through this thing one of

539
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:52,168
the QA testers is why do we have so many

540
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:53,609
hops for authentication

541
00:25:52,169 --> 00:25:59,879
don't we do that in the app and they're

542
00:25:53,609 --> 00:26:02,100
like I mean yeah it's just a question

543
00:25:59,879 --> 00:26:04,168
<font color="#E5E5E5">but now they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can probably redesign that</font>

544
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:06,629
out of the application because they took

545
00:26:04,169 --> 00:26:07,679
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> upfront the depths we're just</font>

546
00:26:06,629 --> 00:26:09,119
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it because that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the way</font>

547
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">they had always done it they weren't</font>

548
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:13,080
wrong they just weren't considering

549
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:15,029
everything at the right time having

550
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:18,029
those other people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the room gains and</font>

551
00:26:15,029 --> 00:26:19,909
broadens that perspective what can you

552
00:26:18,029 --> 00:26:22,409
do to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make yourself less of a target</font>

553
00:26:19,909 --> 00:26:24,210
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't make yourself</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> less of a</font>

554
00:26:22,409 --> 00:26:26,070
target but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can slow down anyone who</font>

555
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:27,480
gets there all those<font color="#CCCCCC"> things are</font>

556
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:33,779
different things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can do to</font>

557
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:35,759
mitigate those problems so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've talked</font>

558
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:38,070
about a lot of broad concepts but how do

559
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:40,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">you get better at this a couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of years</font>

560
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:43,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">ago I saw Jason give a talk at Derby</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> con</font>

561
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:45,989
about his voyage from being a sysadmin

562
00:26:43,259 --> 00:26:47,850
and doing mostly just maintenance tasks

563
00:26:45,989 --> 00:26:49,350
to getting a job<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a pen tester</font>

564
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:50,879
somebody took a chance on him because he

565
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:55,678
<font color="#CCCCCC">had passion and he jumped into pen</font>

566
00:26:50,879 --> 00:26:58,498
testing<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay great how do you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> learn to</font>

567
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:01,859
do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> overnight it's really hard it's</font>

568
00:26:58,499 --> 00:27:04,169
really intense but here in security it's

569
00:27:01,859 --> 00:27:06,899
fairly easy you guys are all here<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a</font>

570
00:27:04,169 --> 00:27:08,999
Saturday I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting paid for this kind</font>

571
00:27:06,899 --> 00:27:11,340
of but not<font color="#CCCCCC"> really I was coming to these</font>

572
00:27:08,999 --> 00:27:12,840

578
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:24,389
something and maybe I know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

this is how<font color="#E5E5E5"> I make things work in my</font>

596
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,918
sometimes to learn so

597
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:10,080
things from certain people when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asked</font>

598
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,279
specific questions here you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just turn to</font>

00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,590
the guy next to you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say hey what are</font>

602
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,070
wonderful this environment is incredible

603
00:28:18,149 --> 00:28:23,629
and it's nice to see so many people

604
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:27,928
taking advantage of it so that's

605
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:30,809
building your intuition but you need

606
00:28:27,929 --> 00:28:34,139
actionable advice you need something<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

607
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:35,460
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> take home I've done a lot of threat</font>

608
00:28:34,139 --> 00:28:38,449
models with a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people who are</font>

609
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:41,059
various stages of willing and unwilling

610
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:43,740
everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinks it sounds super easy oh</font>

611
00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:45,059
great yeah super we can just draw some

612
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,830
stuff on the board write some things

613
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:51,029
down and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we ignore it and go back</font>

614
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:52,199
to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you guys are happy there's a</font>

615
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:55,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that get in the way of</font>

616
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:57,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">succeeding with this it's easy to hand</font>

617
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:00,200
wave that last step or make a simple

618
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:03,600
mistake and throw off the whole process

619
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:06,269
however<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that redesign example I</font>

620
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:08,820
gave you it's also super easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

621
00:29:06,269 --> 00:29:10,679
immense value out of that if those QA

622
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:12,629
people hadn't asked why we make so many

623
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:15,450
hops until after they had implemented it

624
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:17,639
that's months<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time down the drain but</font>

625
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:19,860
having that<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting up front now they</font>

626
00:29:17,639 --> 00:29:23,010
can spend a day<font color="#CCCCCC"> or two redesigning it to</font>

627
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:29,490
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it simpler easier to protect easier</font>

628
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:33,360
to install and easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand so</font>

629
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:40,919
yeah one very very simple misstep and it

630
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:42,360
all goes for not wait<font color="#CCCCCC"> for it when i draw</font>

631
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:45,409
grand<font color="#E5E5E5"> this presentation in front of my</font>

632
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:48,408
team they threw things at me at the end

633
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:48,409
oops

634
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:56,510
is this not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best metaphor for</font>

635
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:59,330
security in general though how many

636
00:29:56,510 --> 00:30:01,460
stories do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> read out there of people</font>

637
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:03,530
like oh man we got it all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right yeah</font>

638
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:08,900
well what if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I say send me cat and they</font>

639
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:13,810
send back most of memory oops so here's

640
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:16,520
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> advice I have looking forward scope</font>

641
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:18,050
especially with<font color="#E5E5E5"> amateur software product</font>

642
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:20,720
like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> learned how to do threat modeling</font>

643
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:22,639
with scope is incredibly hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> to deal</font>

644
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,590
with everybody wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you</font>

645
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">everything about their baby corner of</font>

646
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:30,290
the project and how it<font color="#E5E5E5"> works you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

647
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:31,909
limit it to a very very specific thing

648
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:34,399
to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> your feet wet with this process</font>

649
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:36,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">to get that actionable intelligence back</font>

650
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:40,190
out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to get the practice doing</font>

651
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:42,650
these things you have to go not the user

652
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:45,470
logs in retrieves gets this blah blah

653
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:47,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">blah no you have to do retrieval they</font>

654
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:50,600
submit this string that goes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

655
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:52,460
processor that returns this data you

656
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:55,070
assume there's authentication<font color="#CCCCCC"> you assume</font>

657
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:57,080
there's TLS you assume whatever you

658
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:59,060
write those<font color="#E5E5E5"> assumptions down in detail</font>

659
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:00,830
then you look at what goes forward what

660
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:03,350
is the user sending at that point are

661
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:06,800
they just sending an ID are they sending

662
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:09,020
an ID session their mother's maiden name

663
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:10,879
the details<font color="#E5E5E5"> of their computer because</font>

664
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:12,260
somebody got excited with<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript so</font>

665
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just pulling everything and</font>

666
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:16,730
throwing it into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the post request why</font>

667
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:18,590
are you sending that you can look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

668
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:23,080
scope but you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> break these things</font>

669
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:23,080
out super tiny and then validate them

670
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:29,690
practice another thing that's hard to do

671
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:33,710
is to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> people to commit to frequent</font>

672
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:36,800
action sometimes we found it best to do

673
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:38,630
half 45 minutes half hour our meetings

674
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,370
once a week or once an interval with all

675
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:42,650
the people you need build up the

676
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:45,409
practice<font color="#CCCCCC"> of having the meeting starting</font>

677
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:47,030
the discussion picking the feature even

678
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:48,830
if you don't get anything the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first few</font>

679
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:50,840
times but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep having</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> those meetings</font>

680
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:52,220
even if you all sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and look at</font>

681
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:54,470
each<font color="#E5E5E5"> other and going I don't really know</font>

682
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:56,780
what could be a problem in our

683
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:58,700
environment we volunteer for that we're

684
00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:00,139
the application security people so we go

685
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,640
and we say do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want us to be in your</font>

686
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:03,530
threat model and they say I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

687
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:05,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we said cool send us the invite if</font>

688
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:06,620
you don't know we'll be there if you

689
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:08,720
know we'll be<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

690
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:10,459
we just we want to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> that other idea we</font>

691
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,620
want to give them that hacker intuition

692
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:14,360
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward what are the bad things</font>

693
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:16,040
that can happen what are the silly

694
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:17,540
things that you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing what are the</font>

695
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:19,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">details that you're not getting at</font>

696
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:22,670
because you're too deep into the process

697
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:24,590
it's your baby nobody wants to look bad

698
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:26,210
when they're in a group of<font color="#E5E5E5"> other people</font>

699
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:32,809
analyzing the thing they wrote or the

700
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:34,700
thing they designed dovetailing into

701
00:32:32,809 --> 00:32:37,190
that getting the wrong people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

702
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:39,860
meeting not having everyone there in our

703
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:41,720
environment we want QA and<font color="#CCCCCC"> dev in every</font>

704
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:44,059
meeting for every process of every

705
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,860
project if we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to get both</font>

706
00:32:44,059 --> 00:32:47,870
sides<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that table in there for that</font>

707
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:50,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussion it's not worth having the</font>

708
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:52,189
meeting because either QA will make all

709
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:54,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">the wrong assumptions about how dev did</font>

710
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:56,000
things and then they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't follow up or</font>

711
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:57,649
devil may call the wrong some shins

712
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,559
about what<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be there shouldn't be</font>

713
00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:02,270
there it's worth skipping the meeting if

714
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:03,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can't get the right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people but you</font>

715
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:05,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">got to look at who are the right people</font>

716
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:07,550
to be there can you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who are</font>

717
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:10,309
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to or have used the product in</font>

718
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:12,110
there as a software company dev and QA

719
00:33:10,309 --> 00:33:13,879
don't use the product the same way our

720
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:15,379
support people do the same way other

721
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:17,330
people do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> inside the company</font>

722
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:20,870
sometimes it's valuable to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

723
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:22,580
advice if you're designing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you want</font>

724
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:24,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">to try and get all the people who are</font>

725
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:27,500
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> affected by it supporting it</font>

726
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:33,080
building it testing it using it if you

727
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:34,640
can the most important slide and the

728
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">most important part of all of this that</font>

729
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:39,559
I keep underscoring over and over is

730
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:41,059
your drawing a diagram you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> writing</font>

731
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:43,428
things down that's great you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting</font>

732
00:33:41,059 --> 00:33:46,040
the details<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome you had a great</font>

733
00:33:43,429 --> 00:33:47,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">meeting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> everybody super kumbaya because</font>

734
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,770
you're all coming together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

735
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:50,960
finally having this thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you're</font>

736
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:53,990
staying on topic for 60 minutes of a

737
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,700
meeting things are going great as you

738
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:57,470
walk out of that room you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to have</font>

739
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:59,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">those action items like they tell you in</font>

740
00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:02,090
every successful meeting book who's

741
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:04,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go off and verify things whose</font>

742
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:06,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">responsibility is it to check stuff to</font>

743
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:09,020
take these things to go and prove that

744
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:11,300
that stuff exists<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes if it's a</font>

745
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:13,969
design phase this has<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> revisited</font>

746
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:15,169
over and over as the devs take something

747
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:16,790
or as someone takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it off and</font>

748
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:18,888
implements it you have to revisit that

749
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:20,570
threat model are we protecting the

750
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:22,100
things we said are<font color="#CCCCCC"> we sending</font>

751
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:25,310
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we promised we would or</font>

752
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:27,319
didn't and then you revisit it for

753
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:28,400
testing did the devs do what they said

754
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,750
they were going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do did the</font>

755
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,580
implementers do what they said they were

756
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:34,400
going to do you have to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

757
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:35,810
process and prove everything my boss

758
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:37,910
told me one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the reasons he hired me</font>

759
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:41,870
when I applied for<font color="#CCCCCC"> this job is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he said</font>

760
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:44,420
well what do you do when something you

761
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:46,790
did doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> work I say I didn't prove it</font>

762
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:48,139
part of implementing a system is proving

763
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:50,270
it to yourself and<font color="#E5E5E5"> others</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it</font>

764
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:54,230
delivers that thing you said threat

765
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:56,870
modeling is no different so I talk fast

766
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:59,540
and I'm running towards the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

767
00:34:56,870 --> 00:35:01,850
presentation but to sum up it's super

768
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:04,250
simple it's just a<font color="#CCCCCC"> conversation it's</font>

769
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:06,410
just validating those things it's hard

770
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:08,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">because it's a lot of work once you get</font>

771
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:11,569
good at it you come up with a long list

772
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:13,910
of assumptions the practice<font color="#CCCCCC"> part though</font>

773
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:15,650
if you're doing this over and over for

774
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:17,149
the same things in the same environments

775
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:18,890
or things like that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that</font>

776
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:20,600
knowledge where you have validated that

777
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:22,460
assumption so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just skip that step</font>

778
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:24,380
the next time you move on to something

779
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:27,500
new okay we did retrieval what about

780
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:30,020
storage okay we did storage<font color="#E5E5E5"> what about</font>

781
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,340
add a new user things like that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

782
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:33,110
enough assumptions out of the way you

783
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:35,030
build<font color="#E5E5E5"> that knowledge of that intimate</font>

784
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:38,480
interaction with the product that you

785
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:39,860
know what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening and you get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> act</font>

786
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,030
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hacker you have to learn what</font>

787
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:45,590
people are going to do to break your

788
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:49,070
system<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really where I'm at</font>

789
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:50,420
but looking around having been to a few

790
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:52,190
of these conferences I wanted to leave

791
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:53,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">you with another really important</font>

792
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:58,870
message on top of my threat modeling

793
00:35:53,720 --> 00:36:01,279
talk and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the community of this if</font>

794
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:04,069
you disagree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything I've said</font>

795
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,870
awesome I'd love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about it if you</font>

796
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:07,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">agreed with me if you've seen what I've</font>

797
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:10,609
done work if you've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> it not work</font>

798
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:12,170
anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that great my contact info</font>

799
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:13,880
will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> up you can get it anywhere i'm</font>

800
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:16,970
on twitter all the time i have a blog

801
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:19,610
I'd love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear it but besides is a</font>

802
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:21,319
community thing I've met these guys who

803
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:23,720
organized the first one quite a few

804
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:26,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">years back now what they want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is they</font>

805
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:28,459
want more of you up here<font color="#E5E5E5"> four years ago</font>

806
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:30,529
I was in the lobby of a hotel at a

807
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:32,990
hacker conference surrounded<font color="#CCCCCC"> by guys in</font>

808
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:34,430
black t-shirts and tattoos learning

809
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:37,368
about penetration testing we

810
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:39,200
I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know was a thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> before it</font>

811
00:36:37,369 --> 00:36:41,329
looks hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get up here and do this</font>

812
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,589
but I'm promise you it's not it wasn't

813
00:36:41,329 --> 00:36:44,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">all that long ago</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was learning</font>

814
00:36:42,589 --> 00:36:46,880
this for the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> time now I've moved</font>

815
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,880
on I've gotten a job doing it I've

816
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:52,190
become<font color="#E5E5E5"> responsible for it you guys all</font>

817
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:54,170
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something great to tell us all and</font>

818
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:56,000
the organizers would love to hear about

819
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:58,160
it when they go to do this next year I

820
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:02,630
urge you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> create a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CFP and get</font>

821
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:05,328
involved and that's the end if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want</font>

822
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:06,859
to feedback that's where you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

823
00:37:05,329 --> 00:37:08,630
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me I'm wrong for</font>

824
00:37:06,859 --> 00:37:10,400
something awesome I want to hear it I

825
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:11,690
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear all the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> details because</font>

826
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,130
this is just<font color="#CCCCCC"> how I've seen it that</font>

827
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:14,960
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean it's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> best way to do it</font>

828
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:16,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">if you've seen a good way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it that</font>

829
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:20,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not talking about i want to hear</font>

830
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:21,230
that too but I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> appreciate it if you do</font>

831
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:23,960
it somewhere out in public so other

832
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:25,460
people can watch on twitter if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you send</font>

833
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">me stuff i'll probably post it to my</font>

834
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:28,790
blog so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that conversation is out</font>

835
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,618
there because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I learned I</font>

836
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:32,359
learned watching people leading in this

837
00:37:30,619 --> 00:37:34,130
field talking on twitter about the fun

838
00:37:32,359 --> 00:37:35,480
stuff they did at work the stuff they

839
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:39,650
pissed them off at<font color="#E5E5E5"> work the stuff</font>

840
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:40,940
they're learning and that's it thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

841
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:43,690
all for<font color="#CCCCCC"> your attention and we're a</font>

842
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:43,690
little early for lunch

843
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:09,890
Oh
