of all my name is Nate I like gifts I

87
00:10:55,149 --> 00:10:58,790
particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> like them during</font>

88
00:10:56,779 --> 00:11:01,579
presentations because they distract the

89
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:05,870
hell out of you look at this lovely

90
00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:07,699
thing all right so anyway so about a

91
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:11,480
year ago I got the<font color="#CCCCCC"> opportunity to come</font>

92
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:14,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">to Ashland from GE aviation and at</font>

93
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:17,079
Ashland I got to build a threat

94
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:19,880
intelligence program from scratch now

95
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:21,319
the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> I that were already there had</font>

96
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,699
done a good job of documenting and

97
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,380
things like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so my job is made a</font>

98
00:11:22,699 --> 00:11:27,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit easier but it was a pretty</font>

99
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:28,970
unique opportunity you know especially a

100
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:31,399
good chance to like really learn how to

101
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:33,199
do it myself and it's been awesome<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

102
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:35,269
so I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of want to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about some of</font>

103
00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:37,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">the lessons learned and sort of the</font>

104
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:39,649
things that all the little things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

105
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:41,300
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put together to to do threat</font>

106
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:44,540
intelligence and do it correctly because

107
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:48,199
there are a lot of a lot of wrong ways

108
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:50,620
to do it it turns out so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's start</font>

109
00:11:48,199 --> 00:11:52,550
with something easy goals all right so

110
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:54,110
obviously before<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do just about</font>

111
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:56,750
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to set you want to</font>

112
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:58,040
set your goals so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the goals of</font>

113
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:00,370
building a threat intelligence program

114
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:02,750
why the heck would you do it right so

115
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:04,399
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> and foremost it's really just</font>

116
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:07,339
about understanding the<font color="#E5E5E5"> threats that</font>

117
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,720
your company faces that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> it from</font>

118
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:11,540
top to bottom understanding those

119
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,120
threads but what what that actually

120
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,439
gives you is that you can you can take

121
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,569
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you can actually learn more</font>

122
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,190
about the risk of your company like what

123
00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:21,140
what's actual risk of these threats the

124
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:22,320
things that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are actually seeing and</font>

125
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,640
that's really ultimately the goal

126
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,050
building a threat intelligence / there's

127
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,510
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean there's a lot that goes into it</font>

128
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:30,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">but it pretty much boils down to that so</font>

129
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:34,020
it's a pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple but but again how</font>

130
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:36,150
the heck do we do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so I laid out</font>

131
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:38,370
a few simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> things here and this is</font>

132
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:41,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">really at a high level this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is how you</font>

133
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:42,420
do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so it all starts with</font>

134
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:44,970
communication you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to</font>

135
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:47,189
communicate<font color="#E5E5E5"> both internally to the teams</font>

136
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:49,860
within your within your company but also

137
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:52,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">externally to other partners and other</font>

139
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:56,960
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing so it</font>

00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:59,520
communication<font color="#E5E5E5"> 100% very important right</font>

141
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,960
but you know along with communication

142
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,800
once you start talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things</font>

143
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:06,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you might be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in then</font>

144
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,699
then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to really dig in and learn</font>

145
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:11,520
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about our enemies the the actors</font>

146
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:13,050
out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> the groups out there the</font>

147
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,970
groups out there that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

148
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:17,640
target our company or target us

149
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:19,110
individually so we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to we want to</font>

150
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:21,030
learn learn learn more about them and

151
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:22,350
then and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

152
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:24,030
collect a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of information about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

153
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:25,440
guys try to figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they're</font>

154
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:28,319
doing who they are what they're after

155
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:31,260
and then then we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to build</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things to</font>

156
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,640
help us help us automate it build things

157
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:35,370
out to help us parse all this data

158
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:37,319
analyze it and do things with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we</font>

159
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:39,090
can draw conclusions and then we start

160
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:42,150
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright nobody just keep doing it</font>

161
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:43,260
right so I guess we can recurse that

162
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:48,360
would be the fancy way to do it or we

163
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:52,230
can just loop while true do this so

164
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:54,240
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little further we should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

165
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:56,970
focus on who our customers are and I

166
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,500
mean that primarily internally so who

167
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">our customers within our company that</font>

168
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,160
are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that are going to use the</font>

169
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:04,260
intelligence that we generate that are

170
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,610
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take all the data all the</font>

171
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,260
conclusions that we draw they're going

172
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:11,130
to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and use it in some way that</font>

173
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:14,630
makes their jobs easier right so we

174
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:14,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">start with detect are detecting</font>

175
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:22,519
look it look at these false positives so

176
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:24,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">your detect team is primarily your your</font>

177
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:26,959
primary customer there they will be the

178
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:29,480
they will be the most direct benefit

179
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:31,189
from the things that you do they take

180
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:34,040
the things the small little the

181
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:35,839
indicators you know maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tactics</font>

182
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,699
and things like that they take those and

183
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,079
they apply them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tools that are</font>

184
00:14:37,699 --> 00:14:41,719
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at things on your network right</font>

185
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:43,550
so they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really your first first and</font>

186
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">foremost customer but at the same time</font>

187
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:47,810
you're pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much nothing without your</font>

188
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:50,269
detection team because the things that

189
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:51,500
they detect the things that they find

190
00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:54,279
those are the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you dig into</font>

191
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:57,050
and learn about so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really kind of a</font>

192
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:58,699
looping relationship I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> so they</font>

193
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:00,560
find things you<font color="#CCCCCC"> dig into them and</font>

194
00:14:58,699 --> 00:15:03,109
analyze them learn about them and then

195
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:07,790
you give them your results and then they

196
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:13,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">go find more things right it's in a</font>

197
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:16,160
response it was it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was really between</font>

198
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:19,329
this one and the I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> any way to try</font>

199
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:21,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do it the other Batman gift for that</font>

200
00:15:19,329 --> 00:15:25,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">one you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys seen that one okay good</font>

201
00:15:21,949 --> 00:15:28,279
thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you thank you God</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right I</font>

202
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,240
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe I just did that but no</font>

203
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:32,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">seriously though your incident</font>

204
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,439
responders they so when you actually

205
00:15:32,209 --> 00:15:34,579
have an incident<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you actually have</font>

206
00:15:33,439 --> 00:15:35,810
something that happens on your network

207
00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:38,888
then of the guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> that go put out the</font>

208
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:40,939
fires right got<font color="#E5E5E5"> word gals sorry bespoke</font>

209
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:43,250
so they go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and put out the fires and</font>

210
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:44,660
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take the data that you</font>

211
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,699
know the things you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know about all the</font>

212
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:49,250
tools tactics procedures things like

213
00:15:46,699 --> 00:15:50,779
that that that you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> learned about</font>

214
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:52,550
about your enemies they're going to take

215
00:15:50,779 --> 00:15:54,649
that and apply it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to what they're doing</font>

216
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:57,680
so say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a threat group out there</font>

217
00:15:54,649 --> 00:15:59,509
that is you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they've compromised the</font>

218
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,769
system they may be moved laterally so

219
00:15:59,509 --> 00:16:01,939
it's a bad incident<font color="#E5E5E5"> right there they're</font>

220
00:16:00,769 --> 00:16:03,290
moving laterally they're going after

221
00:16:01,939 --> 00:16:04,279
certain things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've actually seen</font>

222
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:07,040
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> before right because you've done</font>

223
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:08,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">the analysis well you can then</font>

224
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,219
communicate with your incident

225
00:16:08,569 --> 00:16:12,050
responders and tell them what they<font color="#E5E5E5"> might</font>

226
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:14,329
expect this actor to do what would<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

227
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:15,979
actor go after are there certain systems

228
00:16:14,329 --> 00:16:17,508
they tend to target are there certain

229
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:19,430
tools and things like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

230
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:22,100
drop on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> boxes how do they even move</font>

231
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:23,239
laterally how do they typically get into

232
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,350
the network all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things are</font>

233
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,420
questions that are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be asked</font>

234
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">during an incident and your job is to be</font>

235
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:29,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to provide that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

236
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,569
so that everyone can go and clean it up

237
00:16:29,899 --> 00:16:34,130
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can you can go back in and</font>

238
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:36,649
again you'll you'll dig into that data

239
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:38,870
later and probably learn new things<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

240
00:16:36,649 --> 00:16:42,290
how they evolved but it's a response

241
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:46,600
definitely a<font color="#E5E5E5"> big deal architecture so</font>

242
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:46,599
this this is pretty all-encompassing I

243
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:52,670
your architects or group or you know or

244
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:54,230
an individual maybe this is a person or

245
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:56,060
a group that's responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

246
00:16:54,230 --> 00:17:00,470
communicating with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest of your IT</font>

247
00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:02,420
IT staff about security issues they

248
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:04,670
provide recommendations from your team

249
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:07,339
to the rest of the company about how you

250
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:10,309
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things we're very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lucky that</font>

251
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:12,559
we have a an individual who's really

252
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:14,178
good at this and they come to the

253
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,589
intelligence team though quite often to

254
00:17:14,179 --> 00:17:18,470
ask questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things that they're</font>

255
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:19,790
seeing so what kind of maybe as an

256
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,140
example what kind of vulnerabilities are

257
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:22,909
out there you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know maybe there's a</font>

258
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:25,309
recent vulnerability<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it sounds</font>

259
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:26,750
particularly bad but is it something

260
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:29,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's actually being exploited are</font>

261
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:31,100
certain groups using this are<font color="#E5E5E5"> these you</font>

262
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,659
know if groups are using this are they a

263
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,340
group that actually targets your company

264
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,990
have you seen them in the past all these

265
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:38,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">things kind of way into the decisions</font>

266
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:39,500
that you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make and so the</font>

267
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:45,800
intelligence really<font color="#E5E5E5"> helps drive those</font>

268
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:48,860
decisions leadership leadership is also

269
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:50,870
a very important customer they're going

270
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:52,340
to take your information and probably

271
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:55,580
talk up they might talk to other

272
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:58,760
companies build your reputation but but

273
00:17:55,580 --> 00:18:00,889
really it's all about taking data so

274
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:03,140
that they can they can build the

275
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:05,210
reputation of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your team when they</font>

276
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:07,370
communicate maybe maybe up to even like

277
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:08,750
the executive<font color="#CCCCCC"> level further like higher</font>

278
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:11,178
up under the CEO and that sort of thing

279
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:14,090
because you know as<font color="#E5E5E5"> we all know as</font>

280
00:18:11,179 --> 00:18:16,160
security professionals often times once

281
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:17,240
you start to<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop threats and things</font>

282
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,179
from happening bad things from happening

283
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,980
they start to question well why are we

284
00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:23,330
paying<font color="#E5E5E5"> for all this stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean we</font>

285
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:26,240
don't ranaut seeing any incidents right

286
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:28,639
so if you take the things that you see

287
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,960
all the information about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the system a</font>

288
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,590
be the specific groups and what they're

289
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:35,480
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you know historical data</font>

290
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:37,370
all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the justification for why</font>

291
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,470
your team exists and you are able to

292
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:40,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">provide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that to your leadership they're</font>

293
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,480
able to do their job better and

294
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,470
justifying

295
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:46,370
all the money that the company's

296
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:50,090
spending on your security team<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font>

297
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:52,189
so let's move<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to some priorities so</font>

298
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:55,040
we have to we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really prioritize</font>

299
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:56,660
because there is got there is so much

300
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:59,928
data out there to collect so many things

301
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:01,970
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do and analyze even if you have a big</font>

302
00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:03,350
team for intelligence it's still hard to

303
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:05,900
keep track of everything and actually

304
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:07,040
you know actually go dry you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know work</font>

305
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:09,140
on everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you could possibly</font>

306
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,190
work on right so we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to set</font>

307
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:13,460
out some priorities of what we're going

308
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:15,230
to try to do so first thing I would

309
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">start with is what are what are the</font>

310
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:18,710
known targets and known things that are

311
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:20,929
targeting your company or your company's

312
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:23,270
sector so if you're if you're for

313
00:19:20,929 --> 00:19:24,320
instance a you know retail company what

314
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:26,750
are the biggest threats that are

315
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:29,000
targeting retail companies if you have a

316
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,440
good detect team what are the things

317
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,669
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've seen they don't have to be</font>

318
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:34,340
incidents they have you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know maybe you</font>

319
00:19:31,669 --> 00:19:35,540
stop them at you know at<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fishing phase</font>

320
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,709
delivery<font color="#CCCCCC"> Faye is something like that</font>

321
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:39,260
they didn't actually get on your network

322
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:40,580
you know that's cool too but who is

323
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:43,400
targeting and what are they trying to do

324
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:44,990
so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to prioritize the</font>

325
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,440
things that are specifically focused on

326
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:50,600
our company next<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is we can branch</font>

327
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,830
out and talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to other companies and</font>

328
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,139
figure out what other companies are

329
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:55,639
struggling<font color="#E5E5E5"> with you know obviously these</font>

330
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:57,860
days one of the what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the major</font>

331
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,880
broad-based things is ransomware it's

332
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:02,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">really easy to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about because</font>

333
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:04,250
everyone struggles with it right so

334
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:05,899
finding out about that that's an easy

335
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:07,640
one but there may be other specific

336
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,870
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that could impact you as well and</font>

337
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,400
you would you would want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know those</font>

338
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:13,010
learn about them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then provide that</font>

339
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,059
to your rescue teams and then you know

340
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:16,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">what have you actually saying I guess</font>

341
00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:19,190
that goes along with the first one the

342
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:21,620
last<font color="#E5E5E5"> one I throw out here is strategic</font>

343
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:23,750
and political things so if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

344
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,979
about political situations especially if

345
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:28,280
you're you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know a lot of we have a lot</font>

346
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:30,320
of global companies in the room<font color="#CCCCCC"> you may</font>

347
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:32,870
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> employees that that are that are</font>

348
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,129
stationed in companies or or you know

349
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:36,199
divisions of your business there's

350
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:38,360
stations in part of the world or parts

351
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:41,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the world where certain political</font>

352
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:42,678
events may influence activity you might

353
00:20:41,179 --> 00:20:45,890
see I mean you could look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at situations</font>

354
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:48,169
like the russia-ukraine usage situation

355
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:49,970
recently if you take<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at black</font>

356
00:20:48,169 --> 00:20:51,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">energy that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Trojan and how you know</font>

357
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:53,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">brought down some power plants and</font>

358
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:56,870
things like that or power grids I should

359
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:59,090
say not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the power plants but you know I</font>

360
00:20:56,870 --> 00:21:01,549
think I think we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> all find that</font>

361
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:04,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a very likely tie back to Russia</font>

362
00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:06,470
itself for that just based off the

363
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:08,030
political situation there at the time so

364
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:13,280
those those are some things that can

365
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:14,809
color what you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at so let's</font>

366
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:20,710
move<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to sources of intelligence where</font>

367
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:25,220
the heck do you get all this stuff yes

368
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:27,169
so the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> number one source of</font>

369
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:29,929
intelligence in my opinion are our

370
00:21:27,169 --> 00:21:31,700
sharing groups now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say that with a</font>

371
00:21:29,929 --> 00:21:33,799
caveat because there are a ton of

372
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,600
different sharing groups out there a lot

373
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:38,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">of them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were in various you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know varying</font>

374
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,189
stages of maturity if you're if you

375
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:42,409
happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be lucky enough to to be a</font>

376
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:43,970
member of a mature sharing group that

377
00:21:42,409 --> 00:21:45,559
shares really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good indicators and really</font>

378
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:47,929
good information about certain threat

379
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:48,860
groups well you're you're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> luck</font>

380
00:21:47,929 --> 00:21:50,659
because you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

381
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:53,959
great information about specifically

382
00:21:50,659 --> 00:21:55,640
about campaigns and groups of bad guys

383
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,559
and the missions that they're after but

384
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:00,860
also all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way down to like specific</font>

385
00:21:57,559 --> 00:22:02,570
malware and how it works you know recent

386
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:04,189
events and activity like I mean these

387
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:06,580
groups they can they can share really

388
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:09,320
really wonderful amounts of information

389
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:11,090
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're of course</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of sharing</font>

390
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:13,879
groups that have yet to get there and

391
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:15,350
that's okay too though<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know these</font>

392
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,669
groups are still trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trust</font>

393
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:18,020
and you know a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what is sharing</font>

394
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:20,960
group makes a sharing group successful

395
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:22,790
is that trust and so you know as sharing

396
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,590
groups kind of kind of live for a while

397
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:26,090
they you begin to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build trust</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with each</font>

398
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:27,860
other with with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other companies</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

399
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:30,168
<font color="#CCCCCC">things like that that are in in these</font>

400
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:31,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">groups so I mentioned all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these these</font>

401
00:22:30,169 --> 00:22:34,100
are these are all like industry specific

402
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:36,620
groups there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a ton more there are</font>

403
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:38,209
other like less formal sharing groups

404
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:42,469
out there that you can you can find that

405
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:44,000
or that are also very useful and then

406
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:45,020
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> going along with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that how do</font>

407
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">you how are you actually going to share</font>

408
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:49,668
this information so these these are just

409
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:52,100
some examples you know they're there are

410
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:53,600
lots of ways to do it but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

411
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:56,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">throughout</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook direct connect</font>

412
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,820
because our right exchange excuse me

413
00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:01,250
because it's it's relatively new it's in

414
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:03,770
beta you have to prove you can you could

415
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:06,080
register for it but you prop you may not

416
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:07,250
get accepted immediately but it has a

417
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of promise and I like it a lot</font>

418
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,800
because it can

419
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,710
really it really controls who you share

420
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,820
with you know they say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

421
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:15,410
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at any of the data you</font>

422
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:17,600
share if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you share it privately and</font>

423
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:22,040
that's that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I probably</font>

424
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:24,350
trust them but I heard that they

425
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:25,970
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> are also building in you know</font>

426
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:27,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">public private key encryption to the</font>

427
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:29,450
data you're sharing so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

428
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:30,649
encrypt it if you're really you know

429
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:32,450
really paranoid about it or if it's

430
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:34,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">really sensitive you know you can do</font>

431
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:37,040
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> or you will be able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do that not</font>

432
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:39,200
sure if<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's done yet but it's all</font>

433
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,700
api-based which I really like so you can

434
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,620
you can really write your automation

435
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,600
about pulling data and pushing data if

436
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:46,699
you really want to and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can really</font>

437
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:49,159
granular you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> finely tuned who you</font>

438
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:50,660
share things with so it could be it's

439
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,970
like it's like sharing with your friends

440
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:55,640
list things that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> build on on your</font>

441
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:56,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">own facebook if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> facebook right</font>

442
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,340
so you can share with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your friends or</font>

443
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,990
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> create little groups that sort</font>

444
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:03,379
of stuff or<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can share with an</font>

445
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:05,179
individual but but yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's</font>

446
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:07,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">great it's got a lot like a ton of</font>

447
00:24:05,179 --> 00:24:10,040
different indicator types and different

448
00:24:07,429 --> 00:24:12,490
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess just Intel types that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

449
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:16,100
share so way way more than most things

450
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:17,960
then there's threat connect its is the

451
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,669
vendor but I actually kind of like some

452
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:22,280
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff they're doing although they</font>

453
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:25,100
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a ton of indicator types</font>

454
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:27,080
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can share but they do allow you</font>

455
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:28,760
to create individual communities and

456
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,169
things like that where you can you can

457
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,960
share data within communities and kind

458
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:34,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">of kind of rank that data and what that</font>

459
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,800
but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I like some of their</font>

460
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:38,210
approaches and then you know it really

461
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,200
doesn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be high tech either if</font>

462
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:41,090
you're really especially if you're

463
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,730
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> started you can share things we</font>

464
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:46,490
have forums via<font color="#CCCCCC"> email you know whatever</font>

465
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:48,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">you want just post out the information</font>

466
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:50,840
you've got of maybe an incident<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

467
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:52,280
things like that and leave it up to the

468
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:54,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">other person to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out how they get</font>

469
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,910
it into their tools

470
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:07,750
all right next up so another<font color="#CCCCCC"> great</font>

471
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:09,310
source information gosh you guys are

472
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:15,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to love staring at this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

473
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:17,260
about it all right open<font color="#E5E5E5"> source</font>

474
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:20,770
intelligence so this could be things

475
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:22,300
like vendor blogs vendor reports but it

476
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:24,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">could also be just Mauer write-ups on</font>

477
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:26,919
some random dudes blog it could be

478
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,420
anything you search on Google so

479
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,860
basically anywhere out there on the

480
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:33,610
internet that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information</font>

481
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:35,199
about things you're seeing and then you

482
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:37,060
know take that and apply to your own

483
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">company of your own systems you know</font>

484
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:42,100
great that's that's what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean by os</font>

485
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:43,960
os n so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's I think it's a</font>

486
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:45,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">great source it's a broad source but you</font>

487
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,460
know you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you have to really take</font>

488
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:49,409
a look at some of it pretty closely

489
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:52,210
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a little bit about</font>

490
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:55,110
attribution later and other little fine

491
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:57,610
details that get a little mixed up but

492
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:59,139
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is still a good source for things</font>

493
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:05,590
to look at and maybe things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

494
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:10,120
happening in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world right feeds yeah</font>

495
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:12,879
so indicator feeds right indicator feeds

496
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:14,379
are are<font color="#CCCCCC"> there big ol their big ol lists</font>

497
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,760
of stuff to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look for right or at least</font>

498
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:19,630
that's that's typically what they're

499
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:21,310
billed as I think they are both good and

500
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:23,950
bad it really depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on how you apply</font>

501
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:28,300
them because we run and we run into

502
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:32,110
issues about just we run it we run into

503
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:33,879
issues about just random things I just

504
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:35,590
like random lots of random indicators

505
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37,660
they get in there<font color="#CCCCCC"> that don't have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

506
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:39,550
of meeting you know you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get you'll</font>

507
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:42,010
give IP and domain lists that are better

508
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:43,629
bad eye peas bad domains things like

509
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:44,920
that and if you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go look for those I</font>

510
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:46,780
mean they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna light up your false</font>

511
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:48,730
positives you know who's<font color="#CCCCCC"> your number one</font>

512
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:50,080
custard customer your detect team right

513
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:51,790
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to come and they're going</font>

514
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">to come and lint you because you've like</font>

515
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:55,899
you've sent so many you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP</font>

516
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,820
addresses that are just bad and they've

517
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:59,410
getting alerts on these bad IP addresses

518
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:01,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then they dig into them and they're</font>

519
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:03,970
like I don't know that was that was

520
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:05,890
skype or that was tour like why is that

521
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:09,640
bad I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know why that's</font>

522
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:12,070
bad so I saw this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this is kind of an</font>

523
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:14,200
interesting quote that I took out of the

524
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:17,159
latest verizon debe ir

525
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:19,630
and really they were talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

526
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,740
analyzing the different all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the numbers</font>

527
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:22,630
of indicator feeds that are out there

528
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:24,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">and they were comparing the indicators</font>

529
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:27,070
in each individual feed to all the other

530
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:28,720
feeds that were out there and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

531
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:31,210
found is that for basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> each</font>

532
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,860
individual feed like<font color="#CCCCCC"> ninety seven</font>

533
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:35,410
percent of the indicators<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that feed</font>

534
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:37,479
we're completely unique<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fee and</font>

535
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:39,700
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that tells me is that there's just</font>

536
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">so many indicators out there and they're</font>

537
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:43,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">changing so quickly so if you've got IP</font>

538
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:45,459
address I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> why these indicators are</font>

539
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,110
IP addresses domains you know emails

540
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:48,490
like sender addresses things like that

541
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:49,780
these are things that bad guys can

542
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:51,550
change on you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop of a hat</font>

543
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:54,730
they change all the time they change

544
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:56,680
automatically so as you're getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

545
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:57,850
feeds they're already out of date and

546
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:00,430
the bad guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> have already</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> changed to</font>

547
00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:02,590
something else so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> you really have</font>

548
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:04,120
to you know kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of take that into</font>

549
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:06,040
context when you're when you're talking

550
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:08,949
about them so what do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really want</font>

551
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:11,020
though out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this well all these feeds</font>

552
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:13,000
actually can they actually can provide

553
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:15,760
context to the things that you're seeing

554
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,170
so take for<font color="#CCCCCC"> instance take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for instance</font>

555
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:20,020
you get an alert and we have an IP

556
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:22,630
address feed of all known tor exit nodes

557
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:25,660
for instance right so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get an alert</font>

558
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:27,880
it may be on some network activity your

559
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:29,740
system automatically presents an alert

560
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:31,680
to your analyst but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it goes and it pulls</font>

561
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:34,150
information about these IP addresses and

562
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:35,950
you know the IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> it actually will</font>

563
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:37,810
look and say you know look against maybe

564
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:39,970
a tour feed and see if is this a tor

565
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:41,889
exit node and if so you know maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

566
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:43,900
provides context to the analyst it says

567
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:45,940
okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> this thing is a tor exit node but</font>

568
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:49,780
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't alert itself it just kind of</font>

569
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:55,510
kind of enhances the data so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

570
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:56,860
yeah sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that if you if you're</font>

571
00:28:55,510 --> 00:29:00,190
able to find feeds though that can

572
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:02,860
automatically provide additional context

573
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:05,740
as well then you found something that's

574
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:07,689
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more useful and so there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are some</font>

575
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:09,730
useful things out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to</font>

576
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:11,590
mention critical stack because they may

577
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:13,270
aggravate a lot of great feeds together

578
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:14,949
you can really pick and choose the ones

579
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:17,800
that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interested in</font>

580
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:20,050
you know known dried<font color="#CCCCCC"> X you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know botnet</font>

581
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:22,270
c2s or something and tor exit nodes you

582
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:23,980
can pull those down and use them how<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

583
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:27,760
will I mean it's really really easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

584
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:29,560
convenient you know alienvault they

585
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,180
they provide this you know open thread

586
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:34,720
exchange where you can you can kind of

587
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:36,730
create groups of feeds and then you rank

588
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,500
them you say like you know did I see

589
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:39,820
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes was it malicious that kind of</font>

590
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:42,330
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> so adding adding a little extra</font>

591
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:45,669
context that's good right and then

592
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:47,080
threat crowd i really like it's a it's a

593
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:49,390
tool that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can really you can just</font>

594
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:51,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">drop like an IP or a domain into threat</font>

595
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:53,080
crowd and it'll say it'll go out and see

596
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:54,639
if there's any relationships that it

597
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:57,010
knows about so maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's malware</font>

598
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,900
samples or maybe it's drop an IP in is

599
00:29:57,010 --> 00:30:00,640
it related to other domains<font color="#CCCCCC"> and what are</font>

600
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:02,200
like the close relationships to that so

601
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,400
we're going to help<font color="#CCCCCC"> build out additional</font>

602
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:10,510
information about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things you're</font>

603
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:14,650
seeing it also has an API so<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving on</font>

604
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:17,010
to internal analysis so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

605
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:20,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's really taking a look at all the</font>

606
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:21,100
things internal to your<font color="#E5E5E5"> company that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

607
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:23,230
know the things you're seeing and

608
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:26,679
analyzing them so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really talking</font>

609
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:27,940
about event analysis here and this can

610
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:30,520
be this<font color="#E5E5E5"> could be anywhere on the kill</font>

611
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:33,490
chain who's familiar with the the kill

612
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:34,960
chain I guess it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright fair number</font>

613
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:36,730
of you but it basically it's a it's a

614
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:41,260
useful way of describing an attack and

615
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:43,240
how far attackers get along that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we</font>

616
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:46,540
when we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a turtle analysis we</font>

617
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:48,040
pretty much we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting data from it</font>

618
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:50,680
could be reconnaissance you know we

619
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:52,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">could we could if we're the bad guys are</font>

620
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,680
hitting our external firewalls you know

621
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:54,610
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to see dig a little deeper</font>

622
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,700
into those and see if it's anything

623
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:58,780
useful is it anything we know about

624
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:01,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously like phishing attacks are</font>

625
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:03,850
pretty big we want to we want to pull

626
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:06,790
those apart as much as we can and and

627
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:08,169
not just talk about not just say like oh

628
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:09,760
what's what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual phishing email</font>

629
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:11,170
look like but what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the what are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

630
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:14,320
attachments involved with it what do

631
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:16,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">they do that sort of thing and then if</font>

632
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:19,090
you happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> incident where</font>

633
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:21,340
where things go south and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

634
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:24,159
are doing stuff on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network you know</font>

635
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:26,199
it then then we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to analyze that as</font>

636
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,700
fully as we can to get all the all the

637
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,770
little things out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that that are</font>

638
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:32,590
useful so that we can do analysis on

639
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:34,690
them we can communicate about them and

640
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:37,570
then we can look for them later<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that</font>

641
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:39,130
sort of thing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know obviously we want</font>

642
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:40,210
to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at specific malware if we have</font>

643
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:41,560
any

644
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:43,570
we want to we want to pull those apart

645
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:45,580
as much as we can and learn learn about

646
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:49,210
them our itself what's it doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

647
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:51,159
will help tell us like really what you

648
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:53,530
know what its goals were helped us kind

649
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:55,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">of color</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know the whole the</font>

650
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:57,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">whole event figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out what they were</font>

651
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:59,889
after and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then of course like targeting</font>

652
00:31:57,670 --> 00:32:01,810
and how like maybe the if it was like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

653
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:04,150
fish how it was themed so who is it

654
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:06,520
targeting are they you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know sales people</font>

655
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:09,220
somewhere are they like research

656
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:11,770
scientists is it you know executives all

657
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:13,060
of that helps really color what the

658
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:15,490
event is and what you can learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

659
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:19,929
that event and all of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is definitely</font>

660
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:21,670
part of intelligence so I threw this on

661
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:23,800
here real quick but you definitely want

662
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:25,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do do some sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of external research</font>

663
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:27,340
while you're while you're doing event

664
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:29,470
analysis so that could be going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

665
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:31,899
virustotal to look for whether something

666
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:33,040
exists out there already if you want to

667
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:36,010
upload<font color="#E5E5E5"> it yourself if you're comfortable</font>

668
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:37,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing that that's fine too could be</font>

669
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:40,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to you know a sandbox like malware</font>

670
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:41,590
hear it you know maybe they already have

671
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:43,420
the sample<font color="#E5E5E5"> there someone's already</font>

672
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:44,800
uploaded it or maybe maybe you want to

673
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:46,780
upload<font color="#E5E5E5"> it yourself if you don't have an</font>

674
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,220
internal sandbox for yourself to see

675
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:51,700
just how<font color="#E5E5E5"> the malware or how the document</font>

676
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:55,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">performs through domaintools up here too</font>

677
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:58,150
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> for to kind of show how how you may</font>

678
00:32:55,900 --> 00:33:00,100
end up<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing additional things like so</font>

679
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:01,930
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> going back to IPS and domains or</font>

680
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:03,399
like a domain registry so we have a

681
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:04,690
domain we know it's bad it was a it was

682
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:07,210
involved in part of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a part of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this event</font>

683
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:09,700
right well we can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> look and say like</font>

684
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:12,400
who registered that domain did they did

685
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:14,710
I use privacy if not well you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what</font>

686
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,180
was the name what does the address what

687
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:18,370
was the email address phone number etc

688
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:20,590
that it was registered<font color="#CCCCCC"> under and then we</font>

689
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:22,780
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and take those in pivot and see</font>

690
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:24,820
if there are any new domains that were

691
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:26,710
registered by those same same little

692
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:32,830
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and that can help us stay</font>

693
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:34,030
on top of maybe a future attack so so

694
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:36,460
we've we've collected all this

695
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:38,740
intelligence what do we where do we put

696
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:40,210
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so if we're analyzing events</font>

697
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:43,240
we're collecting things from open source

698
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:48,580
places we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking with partners etc</font>

699
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:50,140
etc where do we put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> right well I you</font>

700
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:53,799
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not shy about the fact that i</font>

701
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:55,480
love crits crits was developed by mitre

702
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:58,779
stands for collaborative research into

703
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:00,580
threats but it's it's basically a broad

704
00:33:58,779 --> 00:34:02,860
not not only just<font color="#E5E5E5"> an indicator database</font>

705
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:05,379
but it also allows you to store all

706
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:08,319
kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other threat intelligence sort</font>

707
00:34:05,379 --> 00:34:10,509
of things like malware samples and

708
00:34:08,319 --> 00:34:11,649
emails and you know domains and IPS and

709
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:13,960
maybe you know even things like

710
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:16,569
assigning campaigns to certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

711
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:18,940
well you can obviously tag things it

712
00:34:16,569 --> 00:34:20,940
basically allows you to take all these

713
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:23,139
things and relate them with each other

714
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:24,190
what that allows<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to do then is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

715
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:26,740
can then kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of walk those</font>

716
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:28,540
relationships and see if you can learn

717
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:31,418
<font color="#CCCCCC">anything new you can do analysis on the</font>

718
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:33,250
relationships themselves so really

719
00:34:31,418 --> 00:34:34,839
useful tool I mean you can start<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

720
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:37,030
simply as you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could just dump</font>

721
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:39,159
indicators in there for<font color="#CCCCCC"> now and then as</font>

722
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:41,169
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more and get more comfortable</font>

723
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:43,030
doing doing intelligence and you you get

724
00:34:41,168 --> 00:34:44,049
some more analysis done then you can

725
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:48,099
start using maybe some of the other

726
00:34:44,049 --> 00:34:49,929
features but it could also be as simple

727
00:34:48,099 --> 00:34:52,299
as just dropping things in a wiki you

728
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:54,369
know or you know a shared Excel document

729
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:55,929
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have among your team I mean if</font>

730
00:34:54,369 --> 00:34:57,700
you're just getting started really the

731
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:59,619
most important thing is is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start</font>

732
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:01,868
storing things right<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to store</font>

733
00:34:59,619 --> 00:35:03,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">it so you can refer to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it later so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

734
00:35:01,869 --> 00:35:05,980
you can you can do analysis on it later

735
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:07,420
if you you know discover maybe things in

736
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:11,200
the future you think might tie back to

737
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:14,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">it and so yeah just documenting it is a</font>

738
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:16,180
great first step so we we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a wiki we</font>

739
00:35:14,589 --> 00:35:18,970
use it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> add like narrative to a lot of</font>

740
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:22,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know we had we had a wiki at</font>

741
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:24,279
GE it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's useful even if you you know</font>

742
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:25,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">it doesn't store the raw atomic data</font>

743
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:28,780
points and allow you to do other things

744
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:30,609
but it's good<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have that narrative get</font>

745
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:32,559
is another thing you could store things

746
00:35:30,609 --> 00:35:34,660
like Yara signatures and get and then

747
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:37,299
have them<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you have your revision</font>

748
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:39,670
control but you also can you know then

749
00:35:37,299 --> 00:35:42,670
easily pull them down to 22 other tools

750
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:43,660
you have out there and then you know I

751
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:47,109
know there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are other things out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

752
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:48,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you can probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use these are</font>

753
00:35:47,109 --> 00:35:51,790
these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> really just the things I use I</font>

754
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:53,529
did throw a melty go on here just

755
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:56,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">because it's a great analysis tool for</font>

756
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:58,690
intelligence you can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

757
00:35:56,859 --> 00:36:00,460
export all your stuff from crits in tau

758
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:01,809
into melty go and kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> in do your</font>

759
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:07,390
transforms on them and things like that

760
00:36:01,809 --> 00:36:09,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">so all right let's go into</font>

761
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:11,230
one of the really fun things and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

762
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:15,279
want to sort of a goal of intelligence

763
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:16,450
as well and that's attribution so when

764
00:36:15,279 --> 00:36:18,010
we're talking about attribution we

765
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:21,250
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically two separate</font>

766
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:23,500
things we're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about either</font>

767
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:25,900
malware family attributions so what is

768
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:28,900
the malware that we're seeing or

769
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:34,900
campaign attribution so I'll get into

770
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:39,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">both</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of them here in so starting with</font>

771
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:41,349
malware am our family attribution so by

772
00:36:39,369 --> 00:36:43,630
doing attribution we're able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

773
00:36:41,349 --> 00:36:45,460
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to communicate pretty effectively</font>

774
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:48,490
and easily what we're seeing right so if

775
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:50,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">I say something is dried x yeah probably</font>

776
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:53,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot of you have immediate context of</font>

777
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:54,609
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> part of why we're</font>

778
00:36:53,109 --> 00:36:56,740
why we do this so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we talk</font>

779
00:36:54,609 --> 00:36:59,828
about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> we actually know what it is and</font>

780
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:01,209
we can actually categorize it so now it

781
00:36:59,829 --> 00:37:03,339
would be great though if if malware

782
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:04,809
authors would just send us our samples

783
00:37:03,339 --> 00:37:06,490
and you can just like run a quick yar

784
00:37:04,809 --> 00:37:08,950
roll on it hits on some things and

785
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:11,439
awesome you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we know exactly what it</font>

786
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:15,220
is right unfortunately that's pretty

787
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:17,859
much never the case so malware is opera

788
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:19,689
skated it's packed<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's encrypted and</font>

789
00:37:17,859 --> 00:37:22,390
then you have give like vendors they get

790
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:26,440
and get into the gettin mix here so I

791
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:28,299
took a sample it's called key base it's

792
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:31,059
just a simple key logger and I looked it

793
00:37:28,299 --> 00:37:33,579
up on virustotal right well I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

794
00:37:31,059 --> 00:37:35,740
at all this<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff right we've got these</font>

795
00:37:33,579 --> 00:37:37,470
vendors are calling it crypt inject I

796
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:39,640
mean you look down a little further

797
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:41,500
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting closer here this one I've</font>

798
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:44,109
never<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard of calls a dark comment</font>

799
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:46,240
that's you know not<font color="#CCCCCC"> quite right but you</font>

800
00:37:44,109 --> 00:37:47,859
know to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be fair to this I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these are</font>

801
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,479
AV signatures right they're not

802
00:37:47,859 --> 00:37:52,180
necessarily meant to do attribution all

803
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:54,309
the time and also this sample it's

804
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:57,009
packed so it's kind of hard you know the

805
00:37:54,309 --> 00:37:58,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">crypt thing probably applies right so</font>

806
00:37:57,009 --> 00:38:02,529
they detect it that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> great so I</font>

807
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:04,740
impacted and then tried and it I didn't

808
00:38:02,529 --> 00:38:07,809
upload it but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't on there great</font>

809
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:09,069
well pivoting a little further I went

810
00:38:07,809 --> 00:38:12,150
out to trend micro to see what they

811
00:38:09,069 --> 00:38:15,069
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> it they called it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kai</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Beck's and</font>

812
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:18,220
honestly I've looked at quite a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

813
00:38:15,069 --> 00:38:19,690
these I don't seek ibex anywhere in key

814
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,589
base like I i don't know maybe I've just

815
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:22,060
got the wrong<font color="#CCCCCC"> sign</font>

816
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:23,380
but I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know where they got this</font>

817
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:24,970
name but that's what they call it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

818
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:27,250
then you see like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Symantec calls it</font>

819
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:30,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">chopped I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> base I don't know how to</font>

820
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:31,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">pronounce that then there's a vast calls</font>

821
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:33,910
it a keylogger so<font color="#E5E5E5"> there there you know</font>

822
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:37,150
that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> close and then ski yeah I</font>

823
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:38,910
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is I mean this is a</font>

824
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:43,990
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it this is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> family of Bauer</font>

825
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:46,660
that has a freaking website right it's

826
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:53,919
called key base the author sells it to

827
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:55,660
you on key based I in so i really only

828
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,700
bring that up just to say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> bauer</font>

829
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:59,710
like attributing a malware family to

830
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:01,529
certain our samples can be really hard

831
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:03,880
it's useful but it can be really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard</font>

832
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:06,820
especially when you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into things that</font>

833
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:08,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> freaking website right so</font>

834
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:09,760
that mean there are plenty of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things out</font>

835
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:11,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">there plenty of tools that bad guys love</font>

836
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,880
to use they're not they're not publicly

837
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:16,200
available maybe they're very narrowly

838
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:19,420
targeted what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you call those I mean</font>

839
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:20,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're you tend to find you no common</font>

840
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,910
ground within your team and then

841
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">hopefully you can you can figure out</font>

842
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:24,430
when you're talking about it when you're

843
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:28,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">sharing with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other groups but it gets</font>

844
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:36,069
pretty hard so moving on to campaign

845
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:38,530
attribution so so tracking campaigns the

846
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:41,080
campaign<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really it's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

847
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:43,120
that is like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the full full attack the</font>

848
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:45,100
motivate the group<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind it there their</font>

849
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:47,680
mission what are they doing who are they

850
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:48,880
targeting what are they after so that

851
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,200
when we're talking about a campaign

852
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,440
we're talking about a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty broad set</font>

853
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:54,790
of things but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful to know so we</font>

854
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,040
can really when we're talking about a

855
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:59,290
campaign we can it comes like it brings

856
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,940
a specific group to light and all the

857
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:02,590
tools tactics procedures that kind of

858
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:06,490
stuff techniques whatever you want to

859
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:09,970
call it all the TTP's that this group

860
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:11,379
uses so so yeah when we when we

861
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:13,330
communicate about it it will instantly

862
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:14,770
bring something to mind if you you know

863
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:16,660
if your team knows about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you</font>

864
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:23,080
have a documented well that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

865
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:24,370
goal with that so campaign attribution

866
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:26,470
especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you're starting a</font>

867
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:29,799
program gets to be it's a little

868
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:31,299
difficult to really start out but with a

869
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,710
little persistence you start to you

870
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:34,430
start to really get a clearer picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

871
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:36,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">you start you start out by just group</font>

872
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:38,000
like activity together so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

873
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:41,690
we're doing about analysis on events

874
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,160
that our company sees remember we really

875
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:44,240
do want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus on the things our</font>

876
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,558
company sees<font color="#E5E5E5"> because those are the</font>

877
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:49,009
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the biggest threat to us</font>

878
00:40:45,559 --> 00:40:50,599
so so we start doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis on those</font>

879
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:53,000
and we start grouping like activity

880
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:55,849
together maybe that is like a particular

881
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,730
fishing theme that you see maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font>

882
00:40:55,849 --> 00:40:59,450
particular set of malware that you see

883
00:40:57,730 --> 00:41:01,040
there's some<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean there's some that</font>

884
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:02,629
are easy like we can we could probably

885
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:05,540
lump all dried egg stuff together<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a</font>

886
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:07,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit right when we when we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

887
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:08,960
we've loved like things like all these

888
00:41:07,369 --> 00:41:11,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">key loggers together like key base or</font>

889
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,829
Hawkeye and then but over time you so

890
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:14,240
you start lumping them together you're

891
00:41:12,829 --> 00:41:16,130
gathering this data you're putting it in

892
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:18,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">crits or whatever you put it in and then</font>

893
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:20,900
and then over time as you see them more

894
00:41:18,589 --> 00:41:22,250
as you gather more information you you

895
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:24,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">start to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> notice that the picture becomes</font>

896
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:26,450
a little little more clear and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

897
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:30,890
honestly happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> can happen kind of</font>

898
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:32,480
organically but so over<font color="#E5E5E5"> time as you're</font>

899
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:34,220
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> more data</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you learn more things</font>

900
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,050
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then and then you can start to break</font>

901
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:38,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">little things apart and you can realize</font>

902
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:39,980
you may realize that oh this delivery

903
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:42,410
theme is shared amongst a bunch of

904
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:44,240
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> groups</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so okay maybe delivery</font>

905
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:46,640
is not a great great indication of this

906
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:48,979
type of campaign but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we dig</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into the</font>

907
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:51,020
Mauer behind it you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe we might</font>

908
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:52,460
learn that the bad guys might make some

909
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:54,829
obstet mistakes and they've left some

910
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:56,809
like web infrastructure open and you can

911
00:41:54,829 --> 00:41:58,640
say like aha got you you know I found

912
00:41:56,809 --> 00:42:01,130
some specific things for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this group I</font>

913
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:03,379
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know who they are and then</font>

914
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:05,030
when you start to see future<font color="#E5E5E5"> events it's</font>

915
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:06,859
pretty it gets a lot easier to kind of

916
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:10,400
kind of understand how that how it all

917
00:42:06,859 --> 00:42:12,650
fits together the one really<font color="#E5E5E5"> important</font>

918
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,540
thing though we talking about campaign

919
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:18,290
attribution really attribution in

920
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:20,750
general is that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want to</font>

921
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:22,520
be afraid<font color="#CCCCCC"> to express confidence and or</font>

922
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:25,400
doubts about the data that you're

923
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:27,410
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about intelligence isn't always</font>

924
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:31,220
an exact science<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are dealing with</font>

925
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:32,390
imperfect imperfect data so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

926
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:34,098
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to express confidence when we're</font>

927
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:35,779
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about something so if you know</font>

928
00:42:34,099 --> 00:42:39,260
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have an event we only see it at</font>

929
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:40,880
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> delivery stage it's they've done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

930
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:42,349
pretty good job at you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> OPSEC</font>

931
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,880
maybe they use the delivery service of

932
00:42:42,349 --> 00:42:46,490
some type and it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hard to</font>

933
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:47,869
tell like what is beyond that well you

934
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:49,700
could say like okay this

935
00:42:47,869 --> 00:42:51,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">spits a couple little things but it's</font>

936
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:53,149
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> low confidence that it matches</font>

937
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:55,819
you know this known group that we have

938
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:57,499
internally so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay or it may</font>

939
00:42:55,819 --> 00:42:59,269
match up perfectly and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be really</font>

940
00:42:57,499 --> 00:43:07,038
confident that it's a group but don't be

941
00:42:59,269 --> 00:43:10,848
afraid to express that<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so one</font>

942
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:13,430
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue of vendors again so vendors</font>

943
00:43:10,849 --> 00:43:15,049
have kind of an incentive<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font>

944
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:17,089
everything sound doing cool like they

945
00:43:15,049 --> 00:43:19,999
discovered something really amazing for

946
00:43:17,089 --> 00:43:21,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">the first time ever because it makes</font>

947
00:43:19,999 --> 00:43:24,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">them look good it draws publicity their</font>

948
00:43:21,589 --> 00:43:27,529
way anyone you think we're familiar with

949
00:43:24,529 --> 00:43:29,990
all these anyone tell me something about

950
00:43:27,529 --> 00:43:35,829
them maybe maybe that they're all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

951
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:42,950
same group are all the same campaign so

952
00:43:35,829 --> 00:43:44,299
I'm pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure they are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so they're</font>

953
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:46,819
all if you actually look at a lot of the

954
00:43:44,299 --> 00:43:48,680
data with these you find out they're

955
00:43:46,819 --> 00:43:51,529
pretty closely linked so then there's

956
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:52,519
like I say they they really like to they

957
00:43:51,529 --> 00:43:55,309
like to make things look new and

958
00:43:52,519 --> 00:43:57,439
interesting but really they may all end

959
00:43:55,309 --> 00:43:58,460
up being the same thing so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've got to</font>

960
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:02,779
be aware of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as well when you're</font>

961
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:05,470
doing attribution so moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> on we got</font>

962
00:44:02,779 --> 00:44:07,400
data we know what we want to do with it

963
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:09,799
the next best<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing you can do</font>

964
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:11,930
especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have a small team is</font>

965
00:44:09,799 --> 00:44:14,869
you automate everything automate as much

966
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:16,430
as you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> automation is wonderful</font>

967
00:44:14,869 --> 00:44:18,650
you're the computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> does the bulk of the</font>

968
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:20,629
boring work for you and you're left to

969
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:22,069
go do<font color="#E5E5E5"> so may be cooler analysis or</font>

970
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:25,819
actually grab some<font color="#E5E5E5"> more things and feed</font>

971
00:44:22,069 --> 00:44:26,989
it into your systems so it's very

972
00:44:25,819 --> 00:44:29,029
important there are lots of steps of

973
00:44:26,989 --> 00:44:31,700
this though so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where we're going</font>

974
00:44:29,029 --> 00:44:33,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get into some specific tools the</font>

975
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:35,149
first thing you need to automate is

976
00:44:33,109 --> 00:44:37,640
indicator collection or just collection

977
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:39,529
of data in general this isn't a by any

978
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:41,839
means the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> way you can do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it I</font>

979
00:44:39,529 --> 00:44:44,739
started with a tool called<font color="#CCCCCC"> IOC parser</font>

980
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:47,450
I've worked it on github and then

981
00:44:44,739 --> 00:44:49,369
started to started to build my own to

982
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:52,450
fit really diff it's more than anything

983
00:44:49,369 --> 00:44:55,700
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a few little different things</font>

984
00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:57,649
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> ioc parser you can feed it a thing</font>

985
00:44:55,700 --> 00:45:00,259
like a PDF or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> text document or</font>

986
00:44:57,650 --> 00:45:01,430
whatever and it'll scrape out indicators

987
00:45:00,259 --> 00:45:04,309
based off read texts

988
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:05,779
right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can then take those</font>

989
00:45:04,309 --> 00:45:07,880
indicators you can throw<font color="#E5E5E5"> them into crits</font>

990
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:10,309
and there you<font color="#CCCCCC"> go you got them in right</font>

991
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:11,839
cool collected the data you can also

992
00:45:10,309 --> 00:45:14,540
roll your own I'm sure there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> others</font>

993
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:17,089
but so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing about this is it's</font>

994
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:18,558
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to because of its regex</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pace</font>

995
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:20,240
it's really easy to scrape email

996
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:21,800
addresses IP addresses domain names

997
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,808
things like that all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things listed</font>

998
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:26,359
here it does a pretty good job scraping

999
00:45:23,809 --> 00:45:28,250
those now you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't obviously</font>

1000
00:45:26,359 --> 00:45:30,170
know when you're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about you know</font>

1001
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:32,359
something like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google IP address</font>

1002
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:34,400
versus you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> an actual bad actor IP</font>

1003
00:45:32,359 --> 00:45:39,348
address but you know hopefully you can

1004
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:40,730
filter<font color="#E5E5E5"> that out later but there are</font>

1005
00:45:39,349 --> 00:45:43,010
certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that struggles with that</font>

1006
00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:47,390
are still pretty nice to collect so

1007
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:49,520
things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> file names with spaces right</font>

1008
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:50,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mean it can't you can't tell you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1009
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:53,000
there's a space there it doesn't know

1010
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:55,460
that that that is actually part of the

1011
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:58,910
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> vxc you texts they're really just</font>

1012
00:45:55,460 --> 00:46:01,040
strings right you know strings

1013
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:02,118
themselves windows services etc etc so

1014
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:05,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">there are things that have struggles</font>

1015
00:46:02,119 --> 00:46:06,980
with because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> redic based but but</font>

1016
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:08,690
one of the things we want to do is we

1017
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:11,869
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find creative ways to continue</font>

1018
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:13,490
to automate this so if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

1019
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:15,260
collect this information how are we

1020
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:18,109
actually going to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it these are</font>

1021
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:20,780
screenshots of cuckoo and some malware

1022
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:22,670
that Brandon cuckoo there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> plenty of</font>

1023
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:25,280
other sandboxes but a sandbox actually

1024
00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:27,530
can oftentimes provide this type of data

1025
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:31,069
in a way that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can actually get</font>

1026
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:33,170
programmatically so cuckoo will give me

1027
00:46:31,069 --> 00:46:34,730
a JSON file that says you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know here's</font>

1028
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:36,109
all the data that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I learned about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1029
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:39,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">smile was thankful when it ran in my</font>

1030
00:46:36,109 --> 00:46:41,808
sandbox right we can take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the modified</font>

1031
00:46:39,799 --> 00:46:43,970
sections of that JSON file or the

1032
00:46:41,809 --> 00:46:45,950
modified files sorry and then we can

1033
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:47,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take those and just directly</font>

1034
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:49,339
parse those<font color="#E5E5E5"> themselves directly out of</font>

1035
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:51,200
the JSON so if there's spaces in there

1036
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:53,390
it doesn't matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you know it's</font>

1037
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:55,460
it's actually in the data as the thing

1038
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:59,509
we the object we need same with things

1039
00:46:55,460 --> 00:47:00,650
like mutexes so so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess one of the</font>

1040
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:02,569
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to i want to point out</font>

1041
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:04,490
about that is you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if you keep</font>

1042
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:06,349
automation in mind and the fact that you

1043
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:09,078
want to programmatically find ways to do

1044
00:47:06,349 --> 00:47:11,540
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the work for you then you can</font>

1045
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:13,040
you can continually find ways to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

1046
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:14,690
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> life easier and you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just always</font>

1047
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,140
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to constantly drive towards that</font>

1048
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:16,400
when you're

1049
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:18,170
you're collecting data when you're when

1050
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:22,340
you're analyzing data things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1051
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:25,190
so just always move towards that and

1052
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:28,340
then there are things that that are

1053
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:31,610
useful for purely intelligence sake and

1054
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:33,980
things that are also have overlap with

1055
00:47:31,610 --> 00:47:36,800
detect so<font color="#E5E5E5"> your detect team isn't going</font>

1056
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:38,840
to care about who is addresses they were

1057
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:41,630
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to care about the name of the</font>

1058
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:42,740
person that registered the domain the

1059
00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:45,920
phone number<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not going to really</font>

1060
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:47,240
help<font color="#E5E5E5"> them detect but on the intelligence</font>

1061
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,100
team one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things you can do is you</font>

1062
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:50,750
can take<font color="#CCCCCC"> that data and you can pivot and</font>

1063
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:54,140
find new things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can be detected</font>

1064
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:55,880
right so there are things<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there that</font>

1065
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:57,560
only the intelligence teams going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1066
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:59,270
care about and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay though I mean</font>

1067
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:00,529
those those are other other points of

1068
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:03,590
data that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to look at that</font>

1069
00:48:00,530 --> 00:48:05,300
may not help you for detect<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah other</font>

1070
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:06,350
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like actor names you know that's</font>

1071
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:09,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">not going to help you detect anything</font>

1072
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:11,839
really exit might you know maybe you've

1073
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:14,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">got get some linkedin profiles and some</font>

1074
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:15,890
invites from from actors<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are posing</font>

1075
00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:17,360
on linkedin is someone like a recruiter

1076
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:19,730
or something I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know and they</font>

1077
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:22,070
they're sending invites to your

1078
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:23,420
scientists or whatever you can you can

1079
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:24,950
maybe detect on that sort of thing based

1080
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:29,860
off name or maybe more likely the

1081
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:32,089
picture the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual jpg itself so</font>

1082
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:33,980
continuing<font color="#CCCCCC"> on with with our automation</font>

1083
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:36,950
and with our tools to help make our

1084
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:39,980
lives easier so frequency analysis is

1085
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:41,629
something that started at GE and we've

1086
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:43,630
we've implemented our own solution that

1087
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:45,890
does essentially the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing but</font>

1088
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:47,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">we've got all these indicators that are</font>

1089
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:49,640
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> into crits and we would love to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1090
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:50,990
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use them for for detection right</font>

1091
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:52,400
we want to feed them automatically out

1092
00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:55,910
to all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools in our environment so</font>

1093
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:57,680
we're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for them but what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if bad</font>

1094
00:48:55,910 --> 00:48:59,299
data gets into Chris what if google com

1095
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,890
gets into Chris I mean it might<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

1096
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:02,630
be related to an attack and it might get

1097
00:49:00,890 --> 00:49:04,190
it you know we're focused on automation

1098
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:05,840
it might actually automatically get

1099
00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:07,610
dumped into crits how do we make sure

1100
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:10,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">that that doesn't get turned on in the</font>

1101
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:11,870
environment so with frequency analysis

1102
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:13,670
you basically take you basically take

1103
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:15,710
new indicators into crits and before<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1104
00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:17,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">turn them on for detection you run them</font>

1105
00:49:15,710 --> 00:49:19,250
against all your historical data or you

1106
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:21,470
know a good subset of your historical

1107
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:23,300
data whether that lives in<font color="#CCCCCC"> splunk so you</font>

1108
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:25,339
know you know some sort of search thing

1109
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:28,380
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> splunk that that categorizes and</font>

1110
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:30,539
collects all the data from from

1111
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:33,869
all your tools and visibility everywhere

1112
00:49:30,539 --> 00:49:36,180
or it could be something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a benign</font>

1113
00:49:33,869 --> 00:49:38,460
repository of files<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you've built we</font>

1114
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:40,410
collect all the files<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we see in</font>

1115
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:42,269
carbon black we collect those in storm

1116
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:45,899
in one location so that we can scan

1117
00:49:42,269 --> 00:49:47,819
those and do things with them so great

1118
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:49,650
we build these rules we run<font color="#E5E5E5"> them against</font>

1119
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:51,538
different subsets of data<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then if it</font>

1120
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:54,539
hits on anything if any if an individual

1121
00:49:51,539 --> 00:49:56,279
indicator hits on anything then we

1122
00:49:54,539 --> 00:49:58,410
market for review if it doesn't hit on

1123
00:49:56,279 --> 00:50:00,269
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome we just turn it on so</font>

1124
00:49:58,410 --> 00:50:01,950
when we go to review though say it hits

1125
00:50:00,269 --> 00:50:03,598
on something<font color="#CCCCCC"> oftentimes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really</font>

1126
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:05,339
really easy to tell whether an indicator

1127
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:06,900
is bad or not right google com don't

1128
00:50:05,339 --> 00:50:11,308
instantly say<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's terrible turn it</font>

1129
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:13,259
off sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe you put data in from</font>

1130
00:50:11,309 --> 00:50:15,960
an event itself that you saw in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

1131
00:50:13,259 --> 00:50:17,190
environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you analyze those you</font>

1132
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:18,390
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably just turn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right on to</font>

1133
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:21,869
unless they look like they were really

1134
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:23,910
noisy but the ones that are that are

1135
00:50:21,869 --> 00:50:25,920
most interesting are the ones that hit

1136
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:27,868
on something and they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> hit a lot</font>

1137
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,980
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you actually need to review it and</font>

1138
00:50:27,869 --> 00:50:30,690
take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> and see whether it was</font>

1139
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:34,410
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you actually detected</font>

1140
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:36,359
with historical data right but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1141
00:50:34,410 --> 00:50:38,788
review it and even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it even if it if</font>

1142
00:50:36,359 --> 00:50:41,519
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is legitimate it like find some some</font>

1143
00:50:38,789 --> 00:50:44,279
legitimate badness but it also finds

1144
00:50:41,519 --> 00:50:45,808
some stuff that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not bad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at all like</font>

1145
00:50:44,279 --> 00:50:47,849
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it's got false positives and</font>

1146
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:49,650
true positives you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just turn</font>

1147
00:50:47,849 --> 00:50:51,569
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> off because honestly indicators are a</font>

1148
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:54,690
dime a dozen<font color="#E5E5E5"> but if it does hit on</font>

1149
00:50:51,569 --> 00:50:55,829
something bad in something bad only then

1150
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:58,259
we might actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have another incident</font>

1151
00:50:55,829 --> 00:51:00,029
we need to go dive into it right so it's

1152
00:50:58,259 --> 00:51:05,069
also frequency analysis i guess is also

1153
00:51:00,029 --> 00:51:12,509
a detection tool to and then we get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1154
00:51:05,069 --> 00:51:13,890
to analyzing<font color="#E5E5E5"> our so so when we so when</font>

1155
00:51:12,509 --> 00:51:15,720
we're looking at all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> these events</font>

1156
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:17,609
right we've we've got all kinds<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1157
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:19,649
things if they're fishing cool you know

1158
00:51:17,609 --> 00:51:21,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">we can we can look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> headers in</font>

1159
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:23,309
the body and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sort of thing but what</font>

1160
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:25,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">will really tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us the story about</font>

1161
00:51:23,309 --> 00:51:27,180
about and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the things that we're</font>

1162
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">seeing is digging all the way down into</font>

1163
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:31,019
the malware to figure out what it's

1164
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:32,940
doing by<font color="#CCCCCC"> figuring out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what it's doing</font>

1165
00:51:31,019 --> 00:51:36,359
you can figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the pieces of data on</font>

1166
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:37,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">the systems and that it's targeting you</font>

1167
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:39,150
can figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out whether maybe it has</font>

1168
00:51:37,589 --> 00:51:41,220
lateral movement capabilities things

1169
00:51:39,150 --> 00:51:42,150
like that what it what is it actually

1170
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:43,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing</font>

1171
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:45,809
we'll provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> you a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of good</font>

1172
00:51:43,049 --> 00:51:48,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">information so we need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> build some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

1173
00:51:45,809 --> 00:51:49,829
to automatically analyze malware that we

1174
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:56,730
see especially if you see a very large

1175
00:51:49,829 --> 00:51:58,500
quantity of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> G so a mal Razoo is a</font>

1176
00:51:56,730 --> 00:52:00,690
place that first first and foremost

1177
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:02,520
stores your Mauer and it a lot and it

1178
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:04,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">also organizes it for you so that you</font>

1179
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:07,500
can you know hopefully query it and get

1180
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:09,959
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> information out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of it but it also</font>

1181
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:12,240
does automated<font color="#CCCCCC"> analysis on all of that</font>

1182
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:14,460
malware so as soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had a sample of</font>

1183
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:17,069
them our zoo it takes it and does all

1184
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:19,650
the manual things well not<font color="#E5E5E5"> all I haven't</font>

1185
00:52:17,069 --> 00:52:21,538
you know built it that far right so it's

1186
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:23,309
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> a work in progress but it does as</font>

1187
00:52:21,539 --> 00:52:24,569
much<font color="#CCCCCC"> as possible automatically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1188
00:52:23,309 --> 00:52:26,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that I would do when I was</font>

1189
00:52:24,569 --> 00:52:29,250
looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sample right it also throws</font>

1190
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:31,380
it into various sandboxes you know

1191
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:33,569
having one<font color="#E5E5E5"> sandbox is great having like</font>

1192
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:35,760
10 is even better because you know

1193
00:52:33,569 --> 00:52:37,470
sandbox is often fail<font color="#E5E5E5"> an hour or malware</font>

1194
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:39,299
would detect a certain type of sandbox

1195
00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:41,490
but not another type basically as many

1196
00:52:39,299 --> 00:52:43,529
as you can get but by throwing<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the</font>

1197
00:52:41,490 --> 00:52:45,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">hours do it starts all this analysis for</font>

1198
00:52:43,529 --> 00:52:47,549
you brings it<font color="#E5E5E5"> all back for you and then</font>

1199
00:52:45,450 --> 00:52:50,730
you can then take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that data</font>

1200
00:52:47,549 --> 00:52:52,920
and you know start your analysis from

1201
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:55,369
there so you can also query that data if

1202
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:57,329
you've if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> built it in a way that</font>

1203
00:52:55,369 --> 00:53:00,539
allows you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to store it in a queryable</font>

1204
00:52:57,329 --> 00:53:02,730
form that sort of thing so now Razoo

1205
00:53:00,539 --> 00:53:06,750
helps helps a lot in terms of in terms

1206
00:53:02,730 --> 00:53:10,440
of automation oh boy so before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I move on</font>

1207
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:16,380
to some fancy pictures anyone have any

1208
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:20,309
quick questions or long questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

1209
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:22,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">right awesome so fun part are some</font>

1210
00:53:20,309 --> 00:53:24,059
results right so we've started we've got

1211
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:26,190
this intelligence program intelligence

1212
00:53:24,059 --> 00:53:28,410
program is a thing that encompasses a

1213
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:29,670
lot of a lot of stuff right you're

1214
00:53:28,410 --> 00:53:30,990
looking at a lot of data you're

1215
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:33,869
collecting a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data you're doing</font>

1216
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:35,459
analysis on it what what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> results</font>

1217
00:53:33,869 --> 00:53:38,880
so this is this is a screenshot of crets

1218
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:41,670
it is a visualization<font color="#CCCCCC"> plugin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1219
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:43,380
actually takes a look at individual data

1220
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:46,170
points and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then their relationships</font>

1221
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:49,680
between those those data points so this

1222
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:51,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">is so like I mean the green dot says or</font>

1223
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:52,680
those are particular those are events

1224
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:54,539
that could be external they could be

1225
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:56,009
internal whatever and then you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

1226
00:53:54,539 --> 00:53:58,380
other things like ip's indicator

1227
00:53:56,010 --> 00:54:00,870
domains email samples all those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

1228
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:03,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> related in this picture right but</font>

1229
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:06,660
this is a picture of of a specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> group</font>

1230
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:08,310
that we track and how it the data is

1231
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:10,680
related and you can kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of see how it</font>

1232
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:15,060
clusters a little bit it also just looks

1233
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:16,620
kind of cool so that counts right if you

1234
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:19,560
digging if you go in a little closer you

1235
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:23,640
can see a lot more details about that

1236
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:26,100
data so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a particular node of a</font>

1237
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:29,220
fire I report on a piece of point of

1238
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:30,630
sale mal were called knit love it's cool

1239
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:32,700
they're all the indicators from that

1240
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:35,640
report but then there's this<font color="#E5E5E5"> little kind</font>

1241
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:37,560
of offshoot for an IP address that is

1242
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:38,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">connected to some other stuff and so you</font>

1243
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:40,230
know that might be connected to it might

1244
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:41,460
be connected to something that that

1245
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:44,370
you've seen internally it might be

1246
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:46,020
connected to another report but by

1247
00:54:44,370 --> 00:54:47,790
visualizing data like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and taking a</font>

1248
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:51,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at the relationships we might find</font>

1249
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:52,650
connections and you know maybe attribute

1250
00:54:51,090 --> 00:54:54,690
this to a campaign that we track that we

1251
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:59,130
didn't know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> otherwise but that's</font>

1252
00:54:54,690 --> 00:55:01,560
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> you build these relationships this</font>

1253
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:04,620
is a nifty little<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture it's kind of</font>

1254
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:07,620
hard to see actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> it oh man that</font>

1255
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:08,970
sucks um it looks it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

1256
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:11,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">star-filled it looks like a galaxy</font>

1257
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:13,529
almost but it's it's basically a picture

1258
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:16,080
of the relationships between all of our

1259
00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:17,760
data and crits from a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> macro</font>

1260
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:18,960
perspective so it's a cool picture if

1261
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,790
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to see how to close it looks</font>

1262
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:24,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">better on my screen I think it looks</font>

1263
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:26,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">awesome but if we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if we dig into this</font>

1264
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:28,830
one that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see too but this is</font>

00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:31,740
this is a cluster<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Brazilian</font>

00:55:28,830 --> 00:55:33,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">activity that we've seen and there are</font>

1267
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:36,810
obviously a ton of relationships between

1268
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:39,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">this activity so to be you know it shows</font>

1269
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:41,130
the same basically it's very similar

1270
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:43,050
group or the same group and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is all</font>

1271
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:48,210
the activity<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've seen or</font>

1272
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:50,700
collected from them so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of a</font>

1273
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:54,090
shout out to why you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to dig</font>

1274
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:57,450
deeper really deep into into collecting

1275
00:55:54,090 --> 00:56:00,480
or really doing close analysis of the

1276
00:55:57,450 --> 00:56:03,089
malware you find right so take dried X

1277
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:05,010
for example local banking<font color="#E5E5E5"> trojan we've</font>

1278
00:56:03,090 --> 00:56:08,670
all we've all heard about right<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font>

1279
00:56:05,010 --> 00:56:11,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">piece of our it has differing botnets</font>

1280
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:12,809
there's you know 122 mentioned here

1281
00:56:11,069 --> 00:56:14,400
there's also like<font color="#E5E5E5"> 220 and then there's</font>

1282
00:56:12,809 --> 00:56:17,910
some others<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can never keep track of</font>

1283
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:19,770
them all but<font color="#E5E5E5"> honestly when we tend to</font>

1284
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:24,328
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> dry decks I'm like up banking I</font>

1285
00:56:19,770 --> 00:56:25,559
don't care but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> found this on Twitter</font>

1286
00:56:24,329 --> 00:56:27,359
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> John Davison found this on</font>

1287
00:56:25,559 --> 00:56:31,290
Twitter and we thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was really</font>

1288
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:32,910
interesting because what he found by

1289
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:36,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">taking a look at dry at one of the dried</font>

1290
00:56:32,910 --> 00:56:38,430
x 122 samples was that it there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font>

1291
00:56:36,359 --> 00:56:40,920
of corporate software that's involved in

1292
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:43,558
that and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> even have in-house apps</font>

1293
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:46,170
that the the malware is looking for and

1294
00:56:43,559 --> 00:56:48,119
to me that says that this actually will

1295
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:51,210
botnet of dried X might actually end up

1296
00:56:48,119 --> 00:56:54,660
being a little bit more targeted than i

1297
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:56,900
would have previously thought right now

1298
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:59,040
again expressing confidence I you know

1299
00:56:56,900 --> 00:57:00,690
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is based off some dude on Twitter</font>

1300
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:03,509
that's cool I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go dig into that</font>

1301
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:04,589
myself and maybe I can become a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

1302
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:08,940
more confident<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's what it's</font>

1303
00:57:04,589 --> 00:57:10,828
doing this person also found that all

1304
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:14,549
all of the dried<font color="#E5E5E5"> X botnets were signed</font>

1305
00:57:10,829 --> 00:57:16,589
by the same private key which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is pretty</font>

1306
00:57:14,549 --> 00:57:19,770
interesting to me because it talks a lot

1307
00:57:16,589 --> 00:57:22,170
that chose to me some of the structure

1308
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:25,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">of these criminal criminal organizations</font>

1309
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:28,160
that that there we can actually get a

1310
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:30,420
little insight into<font color="#CCCCCC"> their structure so</font>

1311
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:33,058
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we know about criminal groups</font>

1312
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:36,089
cyber criminal groups we know they run a

1313
00:57:33,059 --> 00:57:38,040
lot like a business so they their bottom

1314
00:57:36,089 --> 00:57:39,960
line is their main goal they want to

1315
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:41,640
make money they structure themselves

1316
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:44,780
like a business they have different

1317
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:48,569
organizational and operational units

1318
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:50,220
they recruit they do things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so</font>

1319
00:57:48,569 --> 00:57:52,650
they run they run a lot like a business

1320
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:54,959
and so by taking a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at something</font>

1321
00:57:52,650 --> 00:57:57,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">like this to me that says that you know</font>

1322
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:58,349
perhaps perhaps dried X we you know we

1323
00:57:57,089 --> 00:58:01,230
all think they're part of the same group

1324
00:57:58,349 --> 00:58:03,240
but you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this is pretty good</font>

1325
00:58:01,230 --> 00:58:05,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">evidence of that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because it</font>

1326
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:08,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">shows to me that there's there's one</font>

1327
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:09,960
company you know cybercriminal company

1328
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:12,240
and then they have different divisions

1329
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:13,829
that run different botnets of dried X

1330
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:17,520
that have different missions basically

1331
00:58:13,829 --> 00:58:19,500
at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can I can infer that again I</font>

1332
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:21,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know medium confidence of that but</font>

1333
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:25,869
I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font>

1334
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:27,940
so bring it<font color="#CCCCCC"> all back together it's</font>

1335
00:58:25,869 --> 00:58:29,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">really all about communicating and then</font>

1336
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:31,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">learning as much as you can about your</font>

1337
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:34,030
enemies you want to dig as far into all

1338
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:35,590
the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have and then you want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1339
00:58:34,030 --> 00:58:37,150
build things out to help you help<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1340
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:39,700
automate that and just keep doing it and

1341
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:41,500
you'll learn a lot a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more about your</font>

1342
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:45,100
overall threat picture your overall risk

00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:46,600
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> your company</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it will it will</font>

1344
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:47,920
help drive a lot of the decisions that

1345
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:49,779
you make and that's that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really the</font>

1346
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:52,390
focus of what an intelligence programs

1347
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:57,130
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do throughout a couple of quick</font>

1348
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:58,868
tools here I osu parser we<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we we're</font>

1349
00:58:57,130 --> 00:59:00,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to open source tools i will make</font>

1350
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:03,970
no guarantees that that will happen but

1351
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:06,609
things like get it into crits<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

1352
00:59:03,970 --> 00:59:09,160
that's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> i wrote that helps get</font>

1353
00:59:06,609 --> 00:59:10,630
data into crits and get it related in a

1354
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:12,069
really logical way that's actually

1355
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:13,600
useful because that's one of the hardest

1356
00:59:12,070 --> 00:59:17,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">things it takes forever</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get data into</font>

1361
00:59:23,950 --> 00:59:27,339
this slide because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a list of a</font>

00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:30,700
few little<font color="#CCCCCC"> things out of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the million you</font>

1363
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:33,400
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use and yeah that's that's really</font>

00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:34,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">all I got so thanks if you have any</font>

1365
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:36,280
questions I'm open to questions

1366
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:37,780
otherwise I mean I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to I'm going</font>

1367
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:41,640
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go get a beer here in a little bit</font>

1368
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:41,640
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd love to talk to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you yeah</font>

1369
00:59:57,259 --> 01:00:01,829
yeah that's that's a great question

1370
00:59:59,309 --> 01:00:04,739
actually question is really how you how

1371
01:00:01,829 --> 01:00:07,069
do you codify confidence how do you

1372
01:00:04,739 --> 01:00:09,719
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually add more structure</font>

1373
01:00:07,069 --> 01:00:12,420
around confidence of indicators since it

1374
01:00:09,719 --> 01:00:13,709
you know as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you said it can be really</font>

1375
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:15,420
about like the burger you ate for<font color="#CCCCCC"> lunch</font>

1376
01:00:13,709 --> 01:00:21,149
or you know the black bean burger in my

1377
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:23,160
case so yeah that is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good</font>

1378
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:25,499
question i mean so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i put data into</font>

1379
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:28,949
kurt's I mark everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a</font>

1380
01:00:25,499 --> 01:00:30,479
confidence<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I think it is that can</font>

1381
01:00:28,949 --> 01:00:32,579
certainly be changed later although I'll

1382
01:00:30,479 --> 01:00:34,109
admit that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to that very</font>

1383
01:00:32,579 --> 01:00:39,269
often because there's obviously just so

1384
01:00:34,109 --> 01:00:41,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">much data but yeah I think it it really</font>

1385
01:00:39,269 --> 01:00:42,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">does kind of come down to gut feel and</font>

1386
01:00:41,009 --> 01:00:43,769
what you're seeing on the screen and how

1387
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:45,569
it's how it's connected but I think you

1388
01:00:43,769 --> 01:00:47,180
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> add I think you can add confidence</font>

1389
01:00:45,569 --> 01:00:49,829
based off relationships that you build

1390
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:51,509
it takes it takes some effort to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1391
01:00:49,829 --> 01:00:52,859
that point because really the first

1392
01:00:51,509 --> 01:00:54,719
thing you're going to do is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to</font>

1393
01:00:52,859 --> 01:00:55,680
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data and get those indicators in</font>

1394
01:00:54,719 --> 01:00:58,229
that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first thing you're</font>

1395
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:59,940
going to do and then as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> mature a</font>

1396
01:00:58,229 --> 01:01:01,198
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more in your program maybe</font>

1397
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:03,660
you get some help some more resources

1398
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:05,279
that can do some work then you can start

1399
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:06,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">to build those relationships and figure</font>

1400
01:01:05,279 --> 01:01:08,160
out you know kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of walk the</font>

1401
01:01:06,569 --> 01:01:09,869
relationships and that can help build

1402
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:12,058
maybe your overall confidence rather

1403
01:01:09,869 --> 01:01:16,069
than maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific indicator confidence</font>

1404
01:01:12,059 --> 01:01:16,069
in that sort of thing so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Coleman</font>

1405
01:02:11,550 --> 01:02:19,040
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not gonna repeat all that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

1406
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:37,470
yeah I'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm gonna be embarrassing</font>

1407
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:45,180
admit that I'm I don't really remember

1408
01:02:37,470 --> 01:02:47,490
what that is specifically oh cool yeah

1409
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:50,669
so he's talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about bloom filters and</font>

1410
01:02:47,490 --> 01:02:52,049
I yeah I mean if it as you say if it's

1411
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:53,780
you know a statistical way to find

1412
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:55,830
whether you've seen things before I

1413
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:57,750
think that's definitely something out I

1414
01:02:55,830 --> 01:03:00,270
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to check out I would have to learn</font>

1415
01:02:57,750 --> 01:03:02,960
it again or for the first time maybe

1416
01:03:00,270 --> 01:03:02,960
yeah

1417
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:14,950
yeah man I so yeah now that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

1418
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:17,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's great now that's a great question</font>

1419
01:03:14,950 --> 01:03:19,839
um yes so the question is what are

1420
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:22,060
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> may be the biggest error or</font>

1421
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:23,470
bias and attribution so I think number

1422
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:26,560
one is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting out of your own way</font>

1423
01:03:23,470 --> 01:03:28,450
like your own personal excitement of

1424
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:30,940
finding something or like seeing a

1425
01:03:28,450 --> 01:03:32,980
connection and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it kind of goes</font>

1426
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:35,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">back to what the question Chris asked</font>

1427
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:37,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">which was you know how do you how do you</font>

1428
01:03:35,110 --> 01:03:39,460
more of like deterministically build

1429
01:03:37,630 --> 01:03:41,290
your confidence and things rather than

1430
01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:44,320
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it based be based off a gut</font>

1431
01:03:41,290 --> 01:03:46,360
feel so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I think like any doing</font>

1432
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:48,070
it intelligence analysis for anything it

1433
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:51,160
you have to be aware of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own set of</font>

1434
01:03:48,070 --> 01:03:53,050
biases and your own you're your own

1435
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:55,270
excitement levels and that the fact that

1436
01:03:53,050 --> 01:03:57,850
you are prone to errors<font color="#CCCCCC"> in judgment and</font>

1437
01:03:55,270 --> 01:03:59,830
just be aware of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and try to I guess</font>

1438
01:03:57,850 --> 01:04:01,720
overcome it and just really look at what

1439
01:03:59,830 --> 01:04:04,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">the data shows rather than what you feel</font>

1440
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:13,379
is right so that's that's a hard thing

1441
01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:13,379
to do though yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh god hey then</font>

1442
01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:30,489
yeah good question<font color="#CCCCCC"> um question is about</font>

1443
01:04:28,299 --> 01:04:32,739
threat actor naming conventions and

1444
01:04:30,489 --> 01:04:34,690
whether you<font color="#CCCCCC"> would you know internally</font>

1445
01:04:32,739 --> 01:04:36,220
use something from<font color="#E5E5E5"> an external source or</font>

1446
01:04:34,690 --> 01:04:38,619
whether you would use something to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1447
01:04:36,220 --> 01:04:41,980
own internal company and why you might

1448
01:04:38,619 --> 01:04:44,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">do that so you know I would start by</font>

1449
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:45,099
saying it kind of depends on I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1450
01:04:44,049 --> 01:04:46,329
think you should probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up with</font>

1451
01:04:45,099 --> 01:04:48,519
your own internal naming convention

1452
01:04:46,329 --> 01:04:49,930
unless you're part of a group share and

1453
01:04:48,519 --> 01:04:53,769
group or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has pretty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

1454
01:04:49,930 --> 01:04:57,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">defined campaign naming conventions that</font>

1455
01:04:53,769 --> 01:04:59,499
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just borrow and use but coming</font>

1456
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:01,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">up with your own allows you to like I</font>

1457
01:04:59,499 --> 01:05:02,680
pointed out with the with a vendor slide

1458
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:04,450
is when you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> different vendor reports</font>

1459
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:07,089
rather than relying on what their what

1460
01:05:04,450 --> 01:05:09,189
they call<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to lump the</font>

1461
01:05:07,089 --> 01:05:12,099
things together that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1462
01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:13,809
have the data to support so if you call

1463
01:05:12,099 --> 01:05:15,579
you know any of those things something

1464
01:05:13,809 --> 01:05:17,410
something internal to yourself you can

1465
01:05:15,579 --> 01:05:19,359
start to relate multiple things to that

1466
01:05:17,410 --> 01:05:21,700
rather than going by maybe the different

1467
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:23,319
things that they they call it the other

1468
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:26,230
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of caveat to is within within</font>

1469
01:05:23,319 --> 01:05:29,589
sharing groups themselves they may be

1470
01:05:26,230 --> 01:05:32,650
sensitive<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a leakage of their campaign</font>

1471
01:05:29,589 --> 01:05:34,960
names and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's if that's a casar</font>

1472
01:05:32,650 --> 01:05:36,940
you think that's the case you may want

1473
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:40,690
to rename things internally just so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1474
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:42,999
you can be sure that that you aren't a

1475
01:05:40,690 --> 01:05:47,819
source of leakage for like a campaign

1476
01:05:42,999 --> 01:05:47,819
name from another group so yeah

1477
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:05,360
ok

1478
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:07,250
ah yeah so questions about indicators

1479
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:09,020
and aging out and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that process might</font>

1480
01:06:07,250 --> 01:06:10,369
work so yeah there are lots of

1481
01:06:09,020 --> 01:06:13,280
indicators that are probably only good

1482
01:06:10,369 --> 01:06:15,290
for a short period of time within crits

1483
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:17,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">sakroots allows you to tag things we've</font>

1484
01:06:15,290 --> 01:06:20,330
started tagging things with like phase

1485
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:21,710
colon and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> X number of days and so</font>

1486
01:06:20,330 --> 01:06:23,090
what that what that does we then have a

1487
01:06:21,710 --> 01:06:24,770
script that's able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through and</font>

1488
01:06:23,090 --> 01:06:26,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">take a look at anything that needs to be</font>

1489
01:06:24,770 --> 01:06:28,610
phased out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then it turns those off</font>

1490
01:06:26,780 --> 01:06:31,160
after that specific you know specific

1491
01:06:28,610 --> 01:06:34,520
amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time that's a hard question</font>

1492
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:36,170
too because there are there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> groups</font>

1493
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:39,650
out there that will reuse the same

1494
01:06:36,170 --> 01:06:41,119
infrastructure years later there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

1495
01:06:39,650 --> 01:06:43,640
groups out there that change constantly

1496
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:45,230
so I guess it really probably depends on

1497
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:47,029
what you're seeing and how it's

1498
01:06:45,230 --> 01:06:48,500
impacting you internally so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

1499
01:06:47,030 --> 01:06:50,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">not getting a lot of false positives you</font>

1500
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:53,180
really need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to turn</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it off probably not</font>

1501
01:06:50,690 --> 01:06:54,530
but you know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are then yeah you</font>

1502
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:59,990
probably want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to explore some sort of</font>

1503
01:06:54,530 --> 01:07:03,820
strategy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to face things out yes Chris so</font>

1504
01:06:59,990 --> 01:07:03,819
oh yes no you go ahead good yeah

1505
01:07:20,790 --> 01:07:28,360
right yeah so this questions about

1506
01:07:25,710 --> 01:07:30,130
indicator types and how that<font color="#E5E5E5"> influenced</font>

1507
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:32,830
how long you know you may keep it active

1508
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:35,200
or not yeah I think I think it does have

1509
01:07:32,830 --> 01:07:37,630
I would have<font color="#CCCCCC"> some influence you know for</font>

1510
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:39,609
instance a mutex is probably something

1511
01:07:37,630 --> 01:07:41,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can just keep on forever but an IP</font>

1512
01:07:39,610 --> 01:07:42,610
address or domain name you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that's</font>

1513
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:44,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you'd</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

1514
01:07:42,610 --> 01:07:48,550
phase out pretty quickly depending on

1515
01:07:44,350 --> 01:07:50,860
again depending on the group so yeah it

1516
01:07:48,550 --> 01:07:52,270
really it depends again but<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah there</font>

1517
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:56,880
are cases where some types will be

1518
01:07:52,270 --> 01:07:56,880
longer<font color="#CCCCCC"> than live than others yeah</font>

1519
01:08:08,970 --> 01:08:14,939
yeah question is what are some of the

1520
01:08:11,609 --> 01:08:17,640
skill sets that that you probably need

1521
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:18,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">to build something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like this you know</font>

1522
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:22,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll speak from a from a team</font>

1523
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:24,149
perspective so I mean it takes doing an

1524
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:27,238
intelligence program takes data from

1525
01:08:24,149 --> 01:08:30,629
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> entire team so it is important to</font>

1526
01:08:27,238 --> 01:08:31,979
have have strong detection capabilities

1527
01:08:30,630 --> 01:08:34,589
it's important to have you know

1528
01:08:31,979 --> 01:08:37,799
management<font color="#CCCCCC"> that understands why you're</font>

1529
01:08:34,589 --> 01:08:41,359
doing intelligence and then when you get

1530
01:08:37,799 --> 01:08:44,850
into the intelligence program itself

1531
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:46,200
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think when it when</font>

1532
01:08:44,850 --> 01:08:47,940
it comes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like maybe automating some</font>

1533
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:49,318
of the stuff it takes you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I write</font>

1534
01:08:47,939 --> 01:08:50,608
scripts all the time so it takes

1535
01:08:49,319 --> 01:08:53,430
probably some programming know how if

1536
01:08:50,609 --> 01:08:55,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're going to do that but it takes</font>

1537
01:08:53,430 --> 01:08:57,719
kind of an analytical mind to and again

1538
01:08:55,890 --> 01:09:01,049
the ability to kind of kind of step out

1539
01:08:57,719 --> 01:09:02,640
and and and realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you want the</font>

1540
01:09:01,049 --> 01:09:07,229
data to do the work more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own</font>

1541
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:09,000
intuition and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it also well I mean it</font>

1542
01:09:07,229 --> 01:09:10,589
also takes pretty deeply technical

1543
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:13,859
skills<font color="#CCCCCC"> too so if we're actually reverse</font>

1544
01:09:10,589 --> 01:09:15,120
engineer malware and really dig down as

1545
01:09:13,859 --> 01:09:19,020
deeply as possible i mean that's that's

1546
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:22,160
an extremely technical skill set so so

1547
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:25,160
yeah pretty broad range<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess yeah</font>

1548
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:25,160
yeah

1549
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:38,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">II I think you can be pretty pretty</font>

1550
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:41,190
successful yeah using<font color="#CCCCCC"> open-source</font>

1551
01:09:38,009 --> 01:09:42,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">sandboxing technologies to do as much of</font>

1552
01:09:41,189 --> 01:09:44,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">the work for you and then of course</font>

1553
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:45,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">there are tons of websites out there</font>

1554
01:09:44,250 --> 01:09:47,009
that you can throw a sample into if

1555
01:09:45,810 --> 01:09:49,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're if you don't care about sharing</font>

1556
01:09:47,009 --> 01:09:51,029
it and they'll they'll run it through a

1557
01:09:49,620 --> 01:09:53,700
sandbox for you you may have to wait a

1558
01:09:51,029 --> 01:09:55,469
little bit but you know that will help

1559
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:58,320
you at least get the main things out of

1560
01:09:55,469 --> 01:10:00,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">that out of that malware but there are</font>

1561
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:02,969
definitely cases where we've found

1562
01:10:00,690 --> 01:10:05,489
things that just don't run<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font>

1563
01:10:02,969 --> 01:10:07,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the only way to really understand</font>

1564
01:10:05,489 --> 01:10:09,870
what it is is to to dig into it and

1565
01:10:07,530 --> 01:10:11,370
reverse engineer it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> unfortunately</font>

1566
01:10:09,870 --> 01:10:12,989
most<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time I think you can get away</font>

1567
01:10:11,370 --> 01:10:14,099
with it fine and actually it's great if

1568
01:10:12,989 --> 01:10:16,739
it runs in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sandbox because that</font>

1569
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:18,210
saves you so much time but if it doesn't

1570
01:10:16,739 --> 01:10:19,769
yet then you really do if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

1571
01:10:18,210 --> 01:10:24,710
learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it you have to have to dig</font>

1572
01:10:19,770 --> 01:10:24,710
into it so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think one more question</font>

1573
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:52,790
right yeah so yeah I think it's you know

1574
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:54,470
when you're limited and resources you

1575
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:56,150
kind of have to take as much as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

1576
01:10:54,470 --> 01:10:57,950
get right and I think I think there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1577
01:10:56,150 --> 01:10:59,660
a lot of great open source resources

1578
01:10:57,950 --> 01:11:02,570
that you can you can collect and learn

1579
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:04,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">from so yeah taking things from from</font>

1580
01:11:02,570 --> 01:11:06,320
emerging threats or from I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> even if</font>

1581
01:11:04,670 --> 01:11:08,270
even if you like really dig into

1582
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:10,190
specific indicator feeds and things like

1583
01:11:08,270 --> 01:11:12,830
that I mean I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would definitely read any</font>

1584
01:11:10,190 --> 01:11:14,059
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source reports malware</font>

1585
01:11:12,830 --> 01:11:16,400
write-ups things like that if you have

1586
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:18,830
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do so cuz obviously time is</font>

1587
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:20,179
limited but I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can you can get a</font>

1588
01:11:18,830 --> 01:11:21,680
lot from there it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just sometimes</font>

1589
01:11:20,180 --> 01:11:25,540
sometimes hard to connect it all

1590
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:27,890
together<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you know you can do it so</font>

1591
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:30,560
we're pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much out of time so thank</font>
