88
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:15,730
department in joining this role I

89
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,290
initially got started in the malware

90
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:19,780
analysis space so I was brought in as a

91
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:22,439
reverse engineer that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened to be in</font>

92
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:24,220
the cyber intelligence team and I grad

93
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,090
gradually over

94
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,190
the course of the time that I've been

95
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:28,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">there started to chip off more and more</font>

96
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:30,580
and more pieces of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the intelligence</font>

97
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,100
program to build kind of an integrated

00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:35,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">one there I'm also currently a PhD</font>

99
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:38,500
candidate over in the computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> science</font>

100
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:42,130
engineering area so if you saw marks

101
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:43,780
talk earlier um he kind of discussed a

102
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:45,790
lot of the distinctions between the

103
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:47,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">computer science versus IT stuff like</font>

104
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:49,900
that if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any questions about the</font>

105
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:53,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">computer science stuff up please feel</font>

106
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:56,500
free to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me as well we actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

107
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:58,570
a NSA certification for cyber operations

108
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:01,540
over there and so I'm actually taking

109
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:03,100
courses out of that program to graduate

110
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:06,969
with a cyber<font color="#E5E5E5"> operation certificate when</font>

111
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:10,330
I get out I did graduate from UC as well

112
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:12,250
with a BS in computer engineering my dad

113
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:13,660
was also a professor here which<font color="#E5E5E5"> means</font>

114
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:18,430
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I pretty much grew up on this camp</font>

115
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:19,990
is my entire life I'm a crits project

116
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:21,310
contributor so if you remember Nate

117
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:22,960
Hal's wrath gave that great talked

118
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:26,439
earlier about the intelligence program

119
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,790
he talked a lot about crits<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Chris</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

120
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">also something that's near and dear to</font>

121
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:32,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">my heart we use it heavily within our</font>

122
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:34,150
program as well and as all I threw<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

123
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,449
on here had been a freebsd community

124
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:39,819
member for quite some time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I</font>

125
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:41,530
really only have six years<font color="#E5E5E5"> of experience</font>

126
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:44,190
in IT security getting into the security

<font color="#E5E5E5">space is relatively new</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

128
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:48,790
comparatively however I've had a prior

129
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:52,390
to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did have a large amount of cs</font>

131
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:57,580
I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to run</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I recently did the half</font>

like eating<font color="#E5E5E5"> sugary things like cake and</font>

134
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:04,150
this stuff like that so it helps with

135
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,130
that I have a six-year-old daughter

136
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:08,410
ducked out earlier she heard a ballet

137
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:10,390
recital today because life always ends

138
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:12,280
up to conflict<font color="#CCCCCC"> with itself and then of</font>

139
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:14,680
course like many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the other Cincinnati</font>

00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:20,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">infosec folk like fancy cats for some</font>

141
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:21,670
reason so yes I also<font color="#E5E5E5"> fancy memes and</font>

142
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:24,730
you'll get that<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of my presentation</font>

143
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:26,050
as well so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't get information</font>

144
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:29,500
out of it at least hopefully you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

145
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:32,890
a laugh so um the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> I put this one</font>

146
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:34,690
together as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said I put together a</font>

147
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:35,980
malware analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> program at GE is kind</font>

148
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:37,990
of one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my first steps in chi è</font>

149
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:40,899
aviation and

150
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:43,060
so I have a lot of experience with a lot

151
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:45,100
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tools that the community has used</font>

152
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:47,349
in analyzing malware and everything like

153
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:49,540
that so I kind of wanted to share a lot

154
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:52,420
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the knowledge</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and expertise that I</font>

155
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:53,980
gained throughout that time in analyzing

156
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,060
a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different you know a lot of</font>

157
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,660
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacks a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

158
00:11:55,060 --> 00:12:01,779
malware stuff like that I know a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

159
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:03,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">shops out there tend to not have as big</font>

160
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:07,149
of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> budget for security work as say GE</font>

161
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:08,260
does and I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try and share a lot</font>

162
00:12:07,149 --> 00:12:10,390
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the knowledge</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've gained over the</font>

163
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:13,870
years and using free tools and the open

164
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:15,790
source community and a lot of the you

165
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:18,220
know sharing community that's out there

166
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:20,290
um to basically put together a malware

167
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:23,050
analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> program as I said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on a budget</font>

168
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:25,089
so I kind of put you know this up here

169
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:27,069
is like go find evils kind of your first

170
00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:29,649
you know your first directive from

171
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:31,540
security those kind of ours tues go find

172
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:32,770
evil we're told that we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go and</font>

173
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:35,560
secure everything and I know that's

174
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:36,880
becoming a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more popular mode of</font>

175
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,489
operation lately with a lot of the

176
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,350
breaches going on so first they hire a

177
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:43,480
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people bring</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them in and say go</font>

178
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:44,980
find evil and you say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well you know</font>

179
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,240
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to need all this capability</font>

180
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:49,420
and everything like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they say</font>

181
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,220
okay great you know will fund with one

182
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:56,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">that capability for you here's what</font>

183
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:58,029
here's what you get so then that's kind

184
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,469
of the you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the classic problem</font>

185
00:12:58,029 --> 00:13:01,570
that's been shared with me from a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

186
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:04,240
my peers in the industry as chronic<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh</font>

187
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:05,680
let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me say just a difficulty finding</font>

188
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,980
funding for it it's a very expensive

189
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:12,640
problem because a very hard problem um

190
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:16,420
so what I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I try and you</font>

191
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:18,339
know define saying what malware is so

192
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:21,099
that I have a nice like one liner that I

193
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:22,720
can give to say a leadership in that

194
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,820
type of thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it put it up here</font>

195
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,339
very good place<font color="#CCCCCC"> that began is to define</font>

196
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:29,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">what is considered to be malware um I</font>

197
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:32,410
usually break this up into two two

198
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:34,029
categories so I've got artifacts that

199
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:36,459
are designed to be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> for malicious</font>

200
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:38,560
purposes so attack tools exploits you'll

201
00:13:36,459 --> 00:13:40,630
see a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things that say that</font>

202
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're supposed to build with metasploit</font>

203
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:44,589
stuff like that those are things that I

204
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:46,779
tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to consider to be so malicious</font>

205
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:47,980
intent or artifacts then there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are also</font>

206
00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:49,870
other ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are designed for</font>

207
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:51,790
legitimate use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't also</font>

208
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,500
sometimes used for malicious attacks

209
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:57,939
and in these<font color="#CCCCCC"> cases you might see tools</font>

210
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:59,830
such as you know up ping for instance or

211
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:01,720
run dll 32 or things like that that

212
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:04,570
attackers will run when they're in your

213
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:06,310
environment but either you gave them to

214
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:08,920
your you know you gave<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> europe</font>

215
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:10,319
you gave them to the attackers because

216
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,030
they're already<font color="#CCCCCC"> insulting the systems or</font>

217
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,920
attackers may just have a nice suite of

218
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:16,360
tools say like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> window sysinternals</font>

219
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">meet or something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like that that might</font>

220
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,950
be useful to them for<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatever reason</font>

221
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:22,380
when they do get into<font color="#CCCCCC"> your network the</font>

222
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:25,690
reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> i do divide up these two</font>

223
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:27,280
categories<font color="#CCCCCC"> like this is because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> category</font>

224
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:29,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">one tends to be things that you can</font>

225
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:32,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">build really good signatures to upon</font>

226
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:34,420
analyzing them to try and identify the

227
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,340
unique characteristics of those within

228
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:39,069
your environment to find the attack

229
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:40,780
tools versus<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other ones that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

230
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:43,600
you're doing an investigation you may

231
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:45,699
come across some tool that say initially

232
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">you don't know what it is but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> later on</font>

233
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:49,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">you find out what it is and you</font>

234
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:51,160
determine that that tools actually say a

235
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:52,930
public use tool that type of thing being

236
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to categorize these things ahead of</font>

237
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:57,099
time when you're analyzing an incident

238
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:59,800
is really a you know is really really

239
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:01,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">helpful and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i figured i just throw it up</font>

240
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,969
here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like an initial point to</font>

241
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,610
consider for the rest of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

242
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:08,920
mainly going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be discussing tools that</font>

243
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:14,650
we use to focus on that category one set

244
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:19,329
of malware so a wide you malware

245
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:23,880
analysis so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to look i like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

246
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:27,610
look at it as a as a constant arms race

247
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:30,010
between the cyber security industry and

248
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:32,020
malware authors so if you're a user

249
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:34,920
who's getting hit by cyber attacks and

250
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:37,120
you have a pretty decent defense team

251
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:40,510
but you're also working on stuff that's

252
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:43,990
very same valuable to the adversary when

253
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:46,330
the adversary attacks you<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they fail</font>

254
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:48,430
to say get in<font color="#E5E5E5"> once they're typically not</font>

255
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:50,920
going to stop there you're not going to

256
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:53,050
say oh you know hey g e--'s got their

257
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:55,270
 together<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know let's uh let's go</font>

258
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:56,979
you know her ass ashland or something

259
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:58,900
right they're not going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that they</font>

260
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:00,880
still<font color="#CCCCCC"> want what we have they're just</font>

261
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:02,560
going to try harder<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get in so for</font>

262
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">instance they're going to keep fishing</font>

263
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,119
the you know fishing your users over and

264
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,620
over again

265
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,980
is slightly more<font color="#CCCCCC"> sophisticated or</font>

266
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:12,170
slightly more creative things so malware

267
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:14,360
analysis ends up not necessarily being a

268
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:16,189
solution or a box you can get off the

269
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,650
shelf in our you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know in our experience</font>

270
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:21,800
it ends up<font color="#CCCCCC"> being more of a program more</font>

271
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:23,420
of a you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know a team of people working</font>

272
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:27,650
together team of analysts working

273
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:29,569
together of analyzing malware using say

274
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:31,520
tools that they've built or tools that

275
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:34,610
they've bought refining these tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

276
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:35,839
chase the changing threat that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming</font>

277
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:37,310
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's coming to them from the</font>

278
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:41,510
outside and even sometimes from the

279
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:43,459
inside so because of that in my

280
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:45,650

program today is the open<font color="#E5E5E5"> source tools</font>

00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:02,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">that have a lot of community input that</font>

295
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:24,559
look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it also from the point of what</font>

302
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:41,000
actually be a very time-intensive very

303
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:43,010
involved task you could get a program

304
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,809
that you got from say an attack from<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

305
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:46,790
fish that's supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a backdoor</font>

306
00:17:44,809 --> 00:17:49,428
that you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> never</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seen before you could</font>

307
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:51,740
probably spend two months the everyday

308
00:17:49,429 --> 00:17:53,240
eight hours two months trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to analyze</font>

309
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:55,100
this thing to understand every single

311
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:59,600
it can do every<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible risk that it</font>

312
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:01,820
has and maybe you'll cut cover like a

313
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,790
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know ten percent of the actual code</font>

314
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:07,340
that's in the program it's just that

315
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:10,730
intensive you know that difficult of a

316
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:13,300
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what we try and do is we try</font>

317
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:17,060
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus on collecting a lot of the</font>

318
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:18,320
artifacts in automating a lot of the

319
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:21,470
artifact an owl

320
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:23,689
cysts that will help us identify say

321
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:25,970
this particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> backdoor that we just</font>

322
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:27,769
saw how does it differ from<font color="#E5E5E5"> say other</font>

323
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:29,389
malware that we've gotten collected up

324
00:18:27,769 --> 00:18:30,860
to now but also how does it differ from

325
00:18:29,389 --> 00:18:35,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the other programs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are in our</font>

environment we also try and build

327
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:41,289
detection around that's our i should say

328
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:44,029
we build analysis work around the

329
00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:46,759
detection capability that we have and

330
00:18:44,029 --> 00:18:48,289
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i say that what i mean is we look</font>

331
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:50,389
at the monitors that we have running on

332
00:18:48,289 --> 00:18:51,740
our hosts we look at the monitors that

333
00:18:50,389 --> 00:18:54,740
we have running on our network censors

334
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:56,659
we try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> see say what what they</font>

335
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:58,700
actually have visibility on and then we

336
00:18:56,659 --> 00:19:00,679
only try and focus on getting those data

337
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:05,690
points out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the malware samples so a</font>

338
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:07,519
great example is if excuse me if a

339
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:08,779
malware sample is intended to be

340
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:11,750
interacted with over a network

341
00:19:08,779 --> 00:19:14,299
connection by say an attacker and it has

342
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:17,179
a lot of say status messages and things

343
00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:20,179
like that if it's communicating in plain

344
00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:22,250
text then detecting those status

345
00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:24,649
messages as messages sent over the

346
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:27,500
network wire you know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be</font>

347
00:19:24,649 --> 00:19:29,268
<font color="#E5E5E5">valuable information especially if I</font>

348
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,460
know that I have network sensors that

349
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:33,919
can pick that<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff up but if I'm trying</font>

350
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:38,149
to look for all programs on my network

351
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:40,429
that can allow an operator to upload and

352
00:19:38,149 --> 00:19:43,008
download files remotely execute files

353
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:44,990
things like that if I'm documenting all

354
00:19:43,009 --> 00:19:47,120
that stuff in a malware report or

355
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:49,639
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that I can't exactly put</font>

356
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,649
together<font color="#CCCCCC"> a detection system for that if</font>

357
00:19:49,639 --> 00:19:55,340
I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have some magic tool that can go</font>

358
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:59,678
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> all exe s on my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network and tell me</font>

359
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:59,678
what all features they have right so

360
00:20:01,269 --> 00:20:05,779
identifying what information you can

361
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:08,000
extract from analyzing a malware sample

362
00:20:05,779 --> 00:20:10,100
and especially what information is

363
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,899
probably most critical in deploying to

364
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,610
individual tools that can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually do</font>

365
00:20:11,899 --> 00:20:15,529
the monitoring and then tell you what

366
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:17,418
the malicious activity is our tell you

367
00:20:15,529 --> 00:20:19,250
what's present on the wire that type of

368
00:20:17,419 --> 00:20:21,110
thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we try and drive a lot of</font>

369
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:27,019
our analysts to do or<font color="#E5E5E5"> I should say to</font>

370
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:30,529
focus on so this is a lot of this stuff

371
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:32,260
is kind of my pitch on say making<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

372
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:34,900
that the work<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put into</font>

373
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:37,090
doing the malware analysis ends up being

374
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,290
say most beneficial most productive to

375
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:40,659
what you're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> because if you spend</font>

376
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:42,070
safe eight hours analyzing a sample and

377
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:44,410
getting a large amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of information</font>

378
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:46,000
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> turn into an alert then</font>

379
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:48,190
that's eight hours that you could have

380
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,140
spent<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at another malware sample</font>

381
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:53,260
and actually getting information may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

382
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:57,370
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can turn into an alert so</font>

383
00:20:53,260 --> 00:21:01,300
diving<font color="#E5E5E5"> into malware analysis i carve the</font>

384
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:03,610
analysis work into two camps so<font color="#CCCCCC"> are into</font>

385
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:06,610
two parts basically one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them is what</font>

386
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:08,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">i call</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dynamic or runtime analysis so if</font>

387
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:12,959
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at malware as malicious</font>

388
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:15,490
code is a malicious program when that

389
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:18,360
program is run on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your system or when</font>

390
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:21,490
that file is opened up on your<font color="#CCCCCC"> computer</font>

391
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:23,409
does it make any changes to the

392
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:25,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">underlying system does it leave any</font>

393
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:27,370
footprints indicating that it has been

394
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:29,920
run on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the system does it right files to</font>

395
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:31,750
disc does it install some sort of

396
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,370
persistence as was mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier so</font>

397
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:36,250
does it set it up so that when you boot

398
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:38,020
the computer there is a configuration in

399
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:39,850
the registry that causes it to start up

400
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:42,760
when your computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> boots every time</font>

401
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:44,290
things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is there</font>

402
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,780
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> way that you could look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at a system</font>

403
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:49,030
without say focusing in on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific</font>

404
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:51,340
file and determine<font color="#E5E5E5"> if that system</font>

405
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:53,200
happens to be infected with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

406
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:56,290
particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> malware so that's</font>

407
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:58,390
one very very beneficial um piece of

408
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:59,950
malware analysis and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> another one is</font>

409
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:02,290
what I call static analysis and so

410
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:05,200
that's when the malware is not executing

411
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:09,340
but you do have a copy like in your

412
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:12,730
possession of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a of a file that you don't</font>

413
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:15,159
know can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> extract characteristics</font>

414
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:16,750
from say known malware files that can

415
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:19,330
help inform<font color="#CCCCCC"> you as to whether this thing</font>

416
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:21,280
you're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now is part of say</font>

417
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:24,610
some malware sample you've seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> before</font>

418
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:27,310
or even um you know can you extract new

419
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:28,689
things from<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to identify if there are</font>

420
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:30,669
any other copies of this thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

421
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:32,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">have now in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your environment if say you</font>

422
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:36,790
can look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> all files that are on all</font>

423
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:38,680
systems in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your environment so what I'm</font>

424
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:42,250
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do now is I'm going to jump</font>

425
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:45,290
into on what amounts to a survey of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

426
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:47,960
know a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of tools</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've used</font>

427
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:50,180
and has had I've been given some input

428
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,830
from some of my colleagues about tools

429
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:53,270
that they found helpful as well that

430
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:55,429
basically can assist with<font color="#E5E5E5"> both of these</font>

431
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:57,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">categories so the slide deck which will</font>

432
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:59,420
be available<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet as well is</font>

433
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:00,950
really going to be if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

434
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,120
malware analysis program or you're

435
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:03,920
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get into malware analysis</font>

436
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:06,909
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of tools that would be</font>

437
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:09,530
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> helpful and pretty much on</font>

438
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:15,740
relatively easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get and easy to</font>

439
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:18,260
install<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a system so but also the</font>

440
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:21,560
first thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will do and this is</font>

441
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:23,120
always fun is a trip to microcenter

442
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,409
right so if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go to</font>

443
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,020
analyze malware you want to go and

444
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:28,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">install the software number one like I</font>

445
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:32,180
mean I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> analyze malware on this</font>

446
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:33,980
desktop much at all it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful</font>

447
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:35,690
especially if I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do an analysis</font>

448
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:37,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">that takes like two hours or something</font>

449
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:40,100
to run to actually have another system

450
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:42,350
to do that on also for safety reasons

451
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:44,659
right like I can accidentally cell phone

452
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:46,010
you know myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> on my laptop even though</font>

453
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:49,100
it's running Linux like that those

454
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:58,000
happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I don't necessarily</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

455
00:23:49,100 --> 00:24:00,379
open myself up to that risk so um<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

456
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,970
what I did was I actually took a

457
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:03,710
shopping trip last month the micro

458
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:06,110
center because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just basically want to</font>

459
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:08,090
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> like hey you know what kind of</font>

460
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:09,620
system can I cobble together for you

461
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:11,000
know really cheap price there so I

462
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:13,699
managed to put this configuration

463
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,810
together and then pull through the

464
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,700
entire thing together in about a half

465
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:18,050
hour<font color="#E5E5E5"> or something like that basically</font>

466
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:21,530
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> four hundred</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bucks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I was able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

467
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:23,480
eight core<font color="#CCCCCC"> decently fast processor 32</font>

468
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:24,860
gigs ram which is always<font color="#E5E5E5"> beneficial if</font>

469
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,710
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of analysis</font>

470
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:29,479
work more RAM needs more on data can be

471
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:33,380
loaded into memory for the analysis

472
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:34,850
which means faster analysis really cheap

473
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:37,520
motherboard that<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes with onboard nic</font>

474
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:40,879
onboard video really cheap case with

475
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:42,680
power and then a enormous hard right

476
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,480
well maybe not<font color="#E5E5E5"> so enormous anymore but</font>

477
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:47,120
it seems pretty enormous to me at the

478
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:50,000
time put you about to put you<font color="#CCCCCC"> bump to</font>

479
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:54,169
1604 on it and off to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> races I was</font>

480
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:56,900
running so um your<font color="#E5E5E5"> mileage may vary on</font>

481
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:59,000
this but I still contend you can get a

482
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:00,680
decent leeching partner for 400

483
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,390
you can throw together I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> recommend</font>

484
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:04,190
if you are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> together like a</font>

485
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:05,660
malware analysis lab or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

486
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:08,000
know do something like this or find some

487
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:10,760
cheap machine the most<font color="#CCCCCC"> critical thing is</font>

488
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,700
that you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a processor for it</font>

489
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:15,110
that can handle virtual machines so like

490
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:18,590
you know was mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier with the</font>

491
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:21,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">cuckoo stuff and we'll dive right into</font>

492
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:24,080
that so for dynamic<font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis a really</font>

493
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:26,960
popular system to use nowadays as cuckoo

494
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:30,879
sandbox it's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> around a really mature</font>

495
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:33,530
since like maybe about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20 12 or so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um</font>

496
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,350
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look at it and I give like</font>

497
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:37,820
three layers right here of kind of my

498
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:39,409
recommended set up like you know if you

499
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:41,360
want to create a virtual machines

500
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:43,100
environment for yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd recommend</font>

501
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,110
looking at all three<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things and</font>

502
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:46,969
installing all of them so VirtualBox

503
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:49,750
ends up being the hypervisor system

504
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:52,130
which for lack of a better term is the

505
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:54,440
you know software that allows you to

506
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:55,670
construct virtual machines so that's the

507
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,250
thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually has the virtual</font>

508
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:59,570
disks the virtual devices all that stuff

509
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:02,210
in the integration with your<font color="#E5E5E5"> operating</font>

510
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:03,649
system Oracle VirtualBox is a really

511
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:05,740
nice command-line interface also has a

512
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:08,210
really nice GUI and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty fast</font>

513
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:10,340
there's also a<font color="#CCCCCC"> vmware out there i don't</font>

514
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:13,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it that much on what other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

515
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:15,790
say it's great too so you know your

516
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:19,010
mileage may vary on it<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think coo coo</font>

517
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:24,050
the way I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> describe it is basically</font>

518
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:25,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">a of inspection service for primarily</font>

519
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:27,290
geared towards VirtualBox but I believe

520
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:30,590
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it actually works with a number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

521
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:31,700
different hypervisor systems so while

522
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:34,399
you're running your operating system

523
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:37,010
inside a virtual box you install cuckoo

524
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,170
sandbox tools that will watch everything

525
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:40,490
going on inside of that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know inside</font>

526
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:43,010
of that virtual machine inside of that

527
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:44,990
operating system and it'll keep logs of

528
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:46,280
everything and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> it also comes with</font>

529
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:47,990
the management interface that can look

530
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:49,700
at all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these logs and then give you</font>

531
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:53,660
pretty reports like what Nate showed you

532
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:55,160
earlier and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally vm cloak is a</font>

533
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:57,470
tool that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i recently became familiar</font>

534
00:26:55,160 --> 00:27:00,320
with it's also free and it provides a

535
00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:02,710
helpful framework for automating work

536
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:05,960
around creating sandbox VM images so

537
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:08,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">Nate's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk earlier he talked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about one</font>

538
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:11,090
VM is great ten beams is even better

539
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:12,590
right so and we'll dive into this later

540
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:14,090
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

541
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:16,428
just get malware in the form of windows

542
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:18,860
exe s you'll get windows exe will get

543
00:27:16,429 --> 00:27:20,630
linux programs you'll get PDF documents

544
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:22,520
that have yexes buried in them you'll

545
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:24,830
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> all sorts of office documents that</font>

546
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:26,900
have exploits things like that so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

547
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:27,830
start to build all these out you can see

548
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">that there are multiple different</font>

549
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:31,699
versions of PDF<font color="#E5E5E5"> Reader multiple versions</font>

550
00:27:29,929 --> 00:27:33,020
a different office stuff like that you

551
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:35,360
can't install all these on single

552
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:38,629
virtual machines so a tool like<font color="#CCCCCC"> vm cloak</font>

553
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:40,189
can help you manage a large varied

554
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:43,580
configuration across many different

555
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:45,740
virtual machines and automate the

556
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:48,080
installation and maintenance of software

557
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:49,490
around it so these three<font color="#E5E5E5"> are probably</font>

558
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:53,178
worth looking into if you want to create

559
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:54,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vm lab for yourselves so the other</font>

560
00:27:53,179 --> 00:27:55,909
nice thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> about virtual box you know as</font>

561
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,799
they said others offer this type of

562
00:27:55,909 --> 00:28:01,220
stuff too but out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the box it can</font>

563
00:27:57,799 --> 00:28:02,270
offer our DP and VNC options so even

564
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:04,039
though this<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be a box that's</font>

565
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:06,379
sitting like in your basement or your

566
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:07,730
closet or something like that you can

567
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:13,309
remote into it and you can still<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a</font>

568
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:14,750
nice desktop so and if anybody has like

569
00:28:13,309 --> 00:28:16,129
any comments or<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions or anything</font>

570
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:18,440
like that while<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going through some</font>

571
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:20,750
of this feel free<font color="#CCCCCC"> to raise</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your hands I</font>

572
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:23,390
will not pretend<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this is going to</font>

573
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:25,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">be a comprehensive list of all tools to</font>

574
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:27,799
do this stuff it's more just tools that

575
00:28:25,909 --> 00:28:28,940
I have some familiarity with and I felt

576
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:35,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">were pretty good for getting the job</font>

577
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:38,149
done so um one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the key</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

578
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:42,049
learned<font color="#E5E5E5"> early on when we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

579
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:44,840
build a similar system for my employer

580
00:28:42,049 --> 00:28:46,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">was that because how you configure the</font>

581
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:48,559
virtual machines is also very important

582
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:50,120
so when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I install windows typically</font>

583
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">Windows comes up with what I'd say is an</font>

584
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:53,779
average<font color="#E5E5E5"> security posture when you</font>

585
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:55,909
install it out of the box there's a

586
00:28:53,779 --> 00:28:58,850
number of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know check boxes you can</font>

587
00:28:55,909 --> 00:29:00,320
turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> off to make it more secure there's</font>

588
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:03,168
a number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> check boxes you can turn</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> off</font>

589
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:05,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make it less secure one of the things</font>

590
00:29:03,169 --> 00:29:07,220
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've liked to do for a lot of our</font>

591
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:09,380
vm configurations has turned all the

592
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:12,529
checkboxes off that make it less secure

593
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:15,110
so basically try and build the most

594
00:29:12,529 --> 00:29:16,820
insecure vm possible go and get a book

595
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:18,379
on securing your windows network or

596
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:20,960
whatever and do the opposite of

597
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:24,320
everything that it tells you right so um

598
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,860
the reason why<font color="#CCCCCC"> i like to do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font>

599
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,620
when i get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a piece of malware</font>

600
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:30,750
I don't want to know how is this going

601
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:34,049
to run in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the you know hypothetically</font>

602
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:36,870
correct environment that my users are

603
00:29:34,049 --> 00:29:38,910
supposed to be using<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to know how</font>

604
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:41,309
is this thing going to run on those two

605
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:43,740
user systems that are like over in

606
00:29:41,309 --> 00:29:45,780
France um wherever who happen to turn

607
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:47,010
off all the checkboxes on there<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

608
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:49,020
they're frustrated because all those

609
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:50,760
checkboxes prevent them from installing

610
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:53,760
like the music app they like to listen

611
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:55,559
to or something like that and because

612
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,240
that's the reality of the world I live

613
00:29:55,559 --> 00:30:00,450
in I don't live in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where the</font>

614
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:02,910
gold image that we you know install on

00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:04,770
all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> our work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> laptops stays pristine</font>

616
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:07,410
for the entire<font color="#CCCCCC"> life</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of that work laptop</font>

617
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:08,910
I live in the reality which is users

618
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:11,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">will reduce the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security posture of</font>

619
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:15,299
their environment in order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make life</font>

620
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:18,600
easier for themselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> so because of that</font>

621
00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:20,309
i want the vm to be most likely to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

622
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,379
compromised so that it can document all

623
00:30:20,309 --> 00:30:23,820
those behaviors<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mentioned earlier that</font>

624
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:28,320
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the malware</font>

625
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:29,820
sample so there's a lot of there's a lot

626
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">of documentation on the internet about</font>

627
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:33,389
doing this if you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set this</font>

628
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:35,940
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'd recommend going on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

629
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:37,740
looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's looking up information</font>

630
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:40,290
on how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to build an insecure Windows</font>

631
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:41,880
environment especially when an insecure

632
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:43,320
Windows environment tailored for say

633
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,299
malware analysis that type of thing

634
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:47,939
another key thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will add just</font>

635
00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:49,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">jumping back up here is when you're</font>

636
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:51,090
installing a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things like</font>

637
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:53,129
cuckoo sandbox and vm cloak and things

638
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:55,350
like that i found<font color="#E5E5E5"> not only is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it helpful</font>

639
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:57,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">to follow the installation instructions</font>

640
00:30:55,350 --> 00:31:00,139
from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> community that puts these</font>

641
00:30:57,510 --> 00:31:04,320
together so<font color="#CCCCCC"> coo coo sandbox orgs</font>

642
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:06,750
documentation but also read it and

643
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,520
follow documentation put up there by

644
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:09,990
security researchers who aren't

645
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,400
affiliated with those communities at all

646
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:12,840
because those are the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

647
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:15,600
typically are going to document all the

648
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:18,090
failure points and the hurdles and the

649
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,889
things that say you missed when you were

650
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:22,320
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> set them up that are confusing</font>

651
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:23,760
you that the documentation just happens

652
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,520
the gloss over because it was written by

653
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,500
people who are familiar with installing

654
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">this thing constantly and very familiar</font>

655
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:32,370
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> like with it from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a development</font>

656
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:33,630
standpoint so you know working off of

657
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:35,428
someone else's script who's not

658
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:38,220
affiliated with that project is very

659
00:31:35,429 --> 00:31:39,210
helpful as well for highlighting some of

660
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:43,289
the gotchas you're running

661
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:44,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">too</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so another one and I'd recommend</font>

662
00:31:43,289 --> 00:31:48,260
installing this on some of the games

663
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:51,539
that you have our debuggers so these are

664
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:53,279
when you want to analyze a program

665
00:31:51,539 --> 00:31:55,470
that's running on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the system you may</font>

666
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:57,929
actually want to run it in a controlled

667
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:59,580
environment where you're trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

668
00:31:57,929 --> 00:32:00,899
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start and stop the programs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

669
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:03,330
pause execution when you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

670
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:04,830
actually edit the memory while it's

671
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:08,760
running that type of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and even</font>

672
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:10,678
analyze the code you know analyze the

673
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:13,110
code that's in memory while it's

674
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:14,940
executing so these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some really good</font>

675
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:17,070
debuggers that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> very popular</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

676
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:18,899
reverse engineering crowd the lower one

677
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:20,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">Ollie debug has a really long history</font>

678
00:32:18,899 --> 00:32:22,889
that goes back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> like 2003 or something</font>

679
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:25,860
it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> not really maintained</font>

680
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:27,480
anymore as far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can tell immunity</font>

681
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:29,459
debugger is a newer one that's popular

682
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:31,200
it just doesn't have this huge like

683
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:33,870
built up<font color="#E5E5E5"> history of documentation about</font>

684
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,880
it so you'll find that that becomes a

685
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:37,620
really common thing is that the most

686
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,870
documented tools are also the oldest

687
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:42,149
ones and in some cases the least the

688
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:44,158
lesser used ones or i should say the

689
00:32:42,149 --> 00:32:45,840
lesser maintained ones because say the

690
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,399
author got tired of maintaining them and

691
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,779
then the newer tools that have a lot

692
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:51,418
more features tend to be the ones that

693
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:58,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have as much documentation around</font>

694
00:32:51,419 --> 00:33:00,330
them so<font color="#CCCCCC"> a static</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis so we're going</font>

695
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:03,270
to jump over to the static analysis side

696
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:05,760
and to be totally honest on a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

697
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:07,770
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I do is spent in the static</font>

698
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:11,700
analysis space a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times I'm</font>

699
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:13,139
analyzing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm analyzing software and a</font>

700
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:15,840
lot of our hunting program at<font color="#E5E5E5"> work is</font>

701
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:17,580
built around looking for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a software</font>

702
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,809
correction seemed malware that does not

703
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:21,418
happen to be running<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the system</font>

704
00:33:18,809 --> 00:33:23,580
either it's in transit we're analyzing

705
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:25,260
it in transit or we're trying to find

706
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:27,360
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> may be latent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the system</font>

707
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:30,120
might be dormant for quite some time and

708
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:33,779
we want to find it before it turns on so

709
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:36,629
I break it up into these five different

710
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:38,429
categories here again this is my own

711
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:39,990
personal opinion here it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not meant to</font>

712
00:33:38,429 --> 00:33:42,320
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> all-encompassing there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

713
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:45,020
some category of static analyzers that

714
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:47,250
that I use<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I left out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of here</font>

715
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:49,559
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of tools for doing this</font>

716
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:50,909
work so it's easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> miss but these are</font>

717
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:52,500
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm going to use the</font>

718
00:33:50,909 --> 00:33:56,880
categories that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to cover</font>

719
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:59,510
um later on so the first one scanners so

720
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:02,430
you know you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> scan your laptop</font>

721
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:07,770
for you know for malware so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this</font>

722
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:09,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">one came back clean so some scanners</font>

723
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:13,800
that you may probably all familiar with

724
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:15,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">are the you know signature-based</font>

725
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:20,310
antivirus systems such as<font color="#CCCCCC"> sophos</font>

726
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:23,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">semantic McAfee you know you know stuff</font>

727
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:25,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">like that in many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cases these maintain a</font>

728
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,210
database of virus definitions I mean to

729
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:28,889
your signature<font color="#E5E5E5"> database they're</font>

730
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:31,500
typically mapped to a lot of those virus

731
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:35,159
IDs that you saw on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the virus</font>

732
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:36,389
total slide earlier and basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

733
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:38,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're looking for is they're opening</font>

734
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:39,629
up files they're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see if some</font>

735
00:34:38,129 --> 00:34:41,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">bytes would happen to be in a file and</font>

736
00:34:39,629 --> 00:34:43,020
if they happen to be in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the file then</font>

737
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:45,629
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to say yes I've identified</font>

738
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:47,520
a piece of malware here so in most of

739
00:34:45,629 --> 00:34:49,710
the cases you can't add new information

740
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:52,259
to the database yourself most of the

741
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:54,990
malware vendors what they do<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially</font>

742
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:56,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the kind of more enterprise level</font>

743
00:34:54,989 --> 00:34:59,759
deployments is they'll actually have a

744
00:34:56,699 --> 00:35:01,919
program set up where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can submit a</font>

745
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,330
sample that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you believe is malware to</font>

746
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,070
the vendor and then they'll actually

747
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:07,140
drop it into their queue and analyze it

748
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:08,760
at at some point in the future that will

749
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:10,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">become a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> new virus definition but you</font>

750
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,550
don't actually get to see the work you

751
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,990
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually get to see the output</font>

752
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:15,090
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't actually get to</font>

753
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:18,899
know why this actually kind of leads

754
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:21,750
into why um we do have that problem as

755
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:23,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">Nate showed which is you have key</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> base</font>

756
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:25,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you have all these</font>

757
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:26,850
antivirus vendors that identify it as a

758
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:28,230
completely different<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing with</font>

759
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:30,299
completely different names and in some

760
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:36,030
cases like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the dark comet one which is</font>

761
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:39,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">completely a laughable conclusion so one</font>

762
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:42,300
of the scanners that we use heavily in a

763
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:45,330
in the malware analysis space is a

764
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:47,310
victor alvarez yarra project so he

765
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:50,610
started this way back in two thousand

766
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:52,560
six or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something and then more recently</font>

767
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:54,150
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think around twenty ten or twenty</font>

768
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,970
eleven he actually got picked up by

769
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:58,860
Google when they bought the virus total

770
00:35:56,970 --> 00:36:00,209
program so that virus<font color="#CCCCCC"> tonal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> program you</font>

771
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:02,160
saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier it's actually a google</font>

772
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:04,920
project now so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know run by</font>

773
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">google</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and he works for them working</font>

774
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,940
full time on this and

775
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:12,180
on some of the back end<font color="#E5E5E5"> pieces of U of A</font>

776
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:13,530
virus total so virustotal actually the

777
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:15,540
intelligence side of it has a lot of

778
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:16,500
features<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are integrated well with</font>

779
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:19,130
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> project and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i would recommend</font>

780
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:21,300
learning this thing inside and out

781
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:22,610
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of public rules on the</font>

782
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:25,620
internet so it's kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

783
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:28,020
community-driven malware detection and

784
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:30,120
its really an attempt by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> community</font>

785
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:32,040
to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and get a lot better about</font>

786
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:34,259
categorizing threats so get a lot better

787
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:36,600
than say your AV signatures out there

788
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:38,550
which to some extent are largely very

789
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:40,920
vendor driven and there you know

790
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:43,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">semantic sophos McAfee really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

791
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:45,300
metric is is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad or not then they get</font>

792
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:47,670
also giving you<font color="#E5E5E5"> a signature name because</font>

793
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:50,400
that helps them kind of work it back on

794
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:52,110
their side to say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know possibly</font>

795
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,440
related things or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> but they have</font>

796
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:57,120
all their own database definitions and

797
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,980
organizational structures that are

798
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,569
proprietary within each one of them and

799
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:02,490
they don't necessarily they're not

800
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:03,930
necessarily compare compelled to share

801
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:05,810
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> amongst one another and that's</font>

802
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:09,060
when you have that huge divergence in

803
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:12,080
malware signature names and even like a

804
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:15,990
lack of overlap so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of open</font>

805
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:17,069
community driven a system to show you

806
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:18,810
that's off and you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually go into</font>

807
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:20,670
any<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of these things I think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

808
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:23,100
a Rolls repository this is another rules

809
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:25,170
repository this is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a tool</font>

810
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:27,060
that's a quick and dirty tool that's

811
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:28,770
basically list all the things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

812
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:30,750
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> turn into a signature from a file</font>

813
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:32,400
and then to auto turn them into a

814
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:36,690
signature so it's like the shotgun

815
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:38,370
approach to your<font color="#E5E5E5"> rule generation so I'm</font>

816
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:41,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to go through a couple of examples</font>

817
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:43,140
really quick what your rules look like

818
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:46,560
just to kind of give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you an idea of the</font>

819
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:50,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">power that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it offers so in this case</font>

820
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:51,900
what you see there's a huge metadata

821
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:53,790
section and basically what<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are is</font>

822
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:57,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">just metadata that would be picked up by</font>

823
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:59,759
the yarra program and possibly could be

824
00:37:57,090 --> 00:38:01,590
queried by a say<font color="#CCCCCC"> on you know secondary</font>

825
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:05,060
integration if you want to integrate

826
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:07,530
your with some other larger tool and

827
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:09,390
then the string strings is actually

828
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:13,770
where the intelligence lives so that is

829
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:15,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">I analyze they file and actually in this</font>

830
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:19,530
case it's somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> analyzed three files</font>

831
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:22,470
and found that<font color="#E5E5E5"> these strings so the</font>

832
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:26,940
this text actually exists within those

833
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:29,790
files as significant information of some

834
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:31,920
sort or unique information possibly in

835
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:34,980
addition<font color="#CCCCCC"> to those strings which a lot of</font>

836
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:37,560
you are probably familiar with it has

837
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:39,180
shorthand for putting together binary

838
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:42,720
strings basically so rather than<font color="#CCCCCC"> having</font>

839
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:44,640
to use your language escape sequences

840
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,709
for building binary strings it<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

841
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:49,319
provides a shorthand for that and it

842
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:51,390
gives you the ability to to use

843
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:53,550
wildcards and patterns for different

844
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:56,009
pieces of the binary code so in this

845
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:58,560
case for instance it's saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it</font>

846
00:38:56,010 --> 00:39:01,050
could be it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

847
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:03,390
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> six bites right here followed by</font>

848
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:07,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything but then only if it's followed</font>

849
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:08,700
by this eighth light right here so<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight</font>

850
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:10,710
bytes where the second bite can be

851
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:12,240
anything but the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them have to be</font>

852
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:14,100
these seven that are that you see here

853
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,319
so it gives you the ability to wild card

854
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:19,049
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have really good</font>

855
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:21,900
documentation on the yarra project

856
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:24,900
website here that goes into detail and a

857
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:26,730
lot more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the complex pattern building</font>

858
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:28,080
that you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go in</font>

859
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:29,580
this isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a presentation on</font>

860
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:31,380
how to write<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own rules I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

861
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:33,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably talk for hours about that i can</font>

862
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:37,980
probably argue with nick hoffman about

863
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:39,540
it for five so who's also around here

864
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:44,010
somewhere and he's a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> person to</font>

865
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:45,509
talk to on this subject so<font color="#CCCCCC"> here's</font>

866
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:47,220
another one and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i pulled this one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

867
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:48,690
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because i also wanted to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> show you</font>

868
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:50,399
one of the other powerful things that it

869
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:52,200
has but with great power comes great

870
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:56,940
responsibility and that's regular

871
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:58,950
expressions so and the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> why i say</font>

872
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:00,690
comes great responsibility is regular

873
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:02,520
expressions if you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> familiar with</font>

874
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:05,400
them i recommend<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get familiar with</font>

875
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:07,830
them so you look up<font color="#CCCCCC"> rag acts or ege acts</font>

876
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:10,500
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have up there on the header we're</font>

877
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:13,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">just regular expression in particular</font>

878
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:15,600
the variant that they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> using here is</font>

879
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:18,930
what's called perl-compatible regular

880
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:22,500
expressions and so pearl is the language

881
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:25,020
that got slammed earlier as a former

882
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:30,630
pearl programmer<font color="#CCCCCC"> I also agree that pearl</font>

883
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:32,580
sucks it sucks to maintain so but I you

884
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:33,420
know again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of languages I</font>

885
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:36,119
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

886
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:38,130
recommend learning perl anyways but

887
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:40,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">python uses the perl-compatible regular</font>

888
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:42,240
expressions<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ruby uses the</font>

889
00:40:40,349 --> 00:40:43,770
perl-compatible regular expressions so

890
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:46,529
that's one of pearls greatest

891
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:48,690
contributions to the you know to the

892
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:51,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">software industry is the that it's</font>

893
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:53,819
regular expression form became like the

894
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:55,650
de facto standard in all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these tools</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

895
00:40:53,819 --> 00:40:57,569
that's because there are a lot of

896
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:59,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">different regular expression libraries</font>

897
00:40:57,569 --> 00:41:01,829
out there pearl happen build one that

898
00:40:59,849 --> 00:41:05,790
was extremely powerful for its time and

899
00:41:01,829 --> 00:41:07,349
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been extended since then so in</font>

900
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:09,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">addition to that when your listing all</font>

901
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:11,069
this Intel here you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> aren't</font>

902
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:13,170
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't just listing like files that</font>

903
00:41:11,069 --> 00:41:14,460
contain all these things or match on

904
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:17,010
files that contain one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

905
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:19,710
you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> do really complex like</font>

906
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:21,780
this one needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to exist within a certain</font>

907
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:24,420
section of the file or certain range

908
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:26,970
within the file or this one this a<font color="#E5E5E5"> dot</font>

909
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:28,589
class needs to occur within 10 bytes of

910
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:31,680
B dot class you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do these really</font>

911
00:41:28,589 --> 00:41:33,720
complicated conditionals that I list

912
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:37,290
down here and again that language is

913
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:39,118
extremely is extremely verbose and

914
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:40,380
extremely powerful<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going to go</font>

915
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:42,059
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> all sorts of different examples</font>

916
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:45,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">about it but it's very well documented</font>

917
00:41:42,059 --> 00:41:47,579
in their documentation so as you're

918
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:50,578
collecting malware over time you're

919
00:41:47,579 --> 00:41:53,609
analyzing it is very important to also

920
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:55,530
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and build scanners by your scanners</font>

921
00:41:53,609 --> 00:41:57,058
that try and detect these malware

922
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:58,670
samples that you're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at so that</font>

923
00:41:57,059 --> 00:42:01,559
you can help yourself identify things

924
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:03,390
that may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> related to an attack that</font>

925
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:05,640
you're you know dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

926
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:08,129
investigating today because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this gives</font>

927
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:10,140
you a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very quick ability to say have</font>

928
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:13,079
something new you you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> something new</font>

929
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:17,730
say a user reports a document on invoice

930
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:19,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">doc to you which by the way if a user</font>

931
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:23,880
reports<font color="#E5E5E5"> an invoice that doc to you</font>

932
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:28,319
that's malicious that's a miracle but if

933
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:29,880
they do they send it to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> um then you</font>

934
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:31,829
can take that invoice that doc and you

935
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,329
can drop<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into these your rules even</font>

936
00:42:31,829 --> 00:42:34,680
building<font color="#E5E5E5"> up for years to try and</font>

937
00:42:33,329 --> 00:42:36,329
determine what other invoice<font color="#E5E5E5"> no Doc's</font>

938
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:39,419
it's like or what other you know

939
00:42:36,329 --> 00:42:41,339
document files it's like and then that

940
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:43,530
can help you identify all these other

941
00:42:41,339 --> 00:42:45,119
incidents that bear some sort of

942
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:46,740
similarity to that it might actually

943
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:50,150
provide you some more avenues for

944
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:56,250
you're branching out your investigation

945
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:59,250
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one is parsers so parsers</font>

946
00:42:56,250 --> 00:43:02,160
basically you know so<font color="#E5E5E5"> English language</font>

947
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:05,670
language parsing right there's also

948
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:08,100
files so files have different structures

949
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:09,780
in them so your exe s<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of you have</font>

950
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:12,240
heard or patterns that type of stuff

951
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:17,760
they've headers and data executable

952
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:20,850
contact everything like that if you want

953
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:23,520
to understand what's going on in each

954
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:25,350
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these sections then you actually</font>

955
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:28,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to have a tool that goes and pulls</font>

956
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:30,299
you know pulls these files apart you

957
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:32,580
don't necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to use the tool</font>

958
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:34,920
that the exploit was written for in

959
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:37,650
order to take apart that file because

960
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:43,110
that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of opens you up to becoming</font>

961
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:45,030
exploited so what we found is that the

962
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:47,130
community actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a number of file</font>

963
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:50,220
parsing tools out there that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

964
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:52,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">good in aren't say Microsoft Office or</font>

965
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:54,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">Adobe PDF reader but there are actually</font>

966
00:43:52,109 --> 00:43:57,750
tools that were written to parse the

967
00:43:54,450 --> 00:44:00,000
specification for those files and in

968
00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:02,790
particular look for cases where the

969
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:06,840
files happen to be malformed for say an

970
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:09,150
exploitative purpose so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to go</font>

971
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:10,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">over some right here on the middle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

972
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:13,080
actually i'll highlight office parser

973
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:16,200
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually written by john</font>

974
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:20,220
davison who's a sitting right dead

975
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:23,069
center in the back there so he wrote it

976
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:24,959
based on I believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking a weekend to</font>

977
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:26,760
read the entire Microsoft oily

978
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:31,560
specification because that's what he

979
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:33,420
likes to do in his spare time and put

980
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:35,640
together<font color="#E5E5E5"> this awesome office parser and</font>

981
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:37,770
some of the concepts<font color="#E5E5E5"> that he put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

982
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:40,259
that were actually based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this other</font>

983
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:42,180
tool PDF parser that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we had used heavily</font>

984
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:45,600
that was written by a guy named Didier

985
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:48,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">Stephens this is generally considered to</font>

986
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:52,020
be like the go to PDF analyzer for

987
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:54,330
malicious<font color="#CCCCCC"> pdfs when we were building a</font>

system to<font color="#E5E5E5"> analyze email attachments of</font>

989
00:44:54,330 --> 00:45:00,180
GE we did not<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a similar tool like</font>

990
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:01,440
that for microsoft office files though

991
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:02,700
we had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of attacks coming in at</font>

992
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,500
microsoft office files which<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm sure</font>

993
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:09,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">comes as a surprise to everybody in this</font>

994
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:11,010
room and and so he put that<font color="#E5E5E5"> together one</font>

995
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:15,180
of the biggest learning points there was

996
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:17,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> assume that the thing you need</font>

997
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:19,799
has already been invented and spend a

998
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:21,690
bunch of time trying to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> solutions</font>

999
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:23,609
to try and fit that sometimes it is

1000
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:27,000
beneficial to just go and write the

1001
00:45:23,609 --> 00:45:28,740
thing yourself so John and well one of

1002
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:32,119
the reasons why I'm dancing around this

1003
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:35,160
slide a bit like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am become a parent</font>

1004
00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:37,109
that's been on the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think open</font>

1005
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:41,578
source since like<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2011</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or twenty ten or</font>

1006
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:43,799
so so this other person whose name

1007
00:45:41,579 --> 00:45:46,040
escapes me at the moment wrote this

1008
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:49,619
program called Python only tools after

1009
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:52,170
learn after<font color="#E5E5E5"> researching Jones office</font>

1010
00:45:49,619 --> 00:45:55,079
parser and that attempts to implement

1011
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:57,869
some similar file carving file parsing

1012
00:45:55,079 --> 00:46:00,750
technology but also goes the<font color="#CCCCCC"> extra step</font>

1013
00:45:57,869 --> 00:46:03,450
in extracting and also analyzing your

1014
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:05,280
visual basic macros which some of you

1015
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:09,328
her in the security field today probably

1016
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:10,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">familiar with vba macros the lil macros</font>

1017
00:46:09,329 --> 00:46:13,280
that you can actually put into your

1018
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:15,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">excel sheets and your PowerPoint</font>

1019
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:17,099
documents and your<font color="#E5E5E5"> Word documents and</font>

1020
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:19,529
all that stuff those things are

1021
00:46:17,099 --> 00:46:21,299
increasingly becoming malware themselves

1022
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:23,329
like that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> increasingly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> becoming a</font>

1023
00:46:21,299 --> 00:46:25,829
large amount of the malware that you see

1024
00:46:23,329 --> 00:46:28,380
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy wrote a really great</font>

1025
00:46:25,829 --> 00:46:30,150
analyzer called only vba so if you want

1026
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:33,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">to analyze PDF documents office</font>

1027
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:37,140
documents those those three tools are

1028
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:38,940
really some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IRC some of the most</font>

1029
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:41,759
critical ones that our team uses for

1030
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:43,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing that analysis another one will</font>

1031
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:45,480
throw up here that might not make sense

1032
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:49,440
but it will after<font color="#CCCCCC"> i talked about it a</font>

1033
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:50,970
bit is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece 7-zip project and you</font>

1034
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:54,690
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be confused why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i throw an archive</font>

1035
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:57,450
parser up here so<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember that recently</font>

1036
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:59,819
microsoft office an<font color="#E5E5E5"> OpenOffice came to a</font>

1037
00:46:57,450 --> 00:47:02,040
new format that's like an<font color="#CCCCCC"> XML format or</font>

1038
00:46:59,819 --> 00:47:04,440
something like that basically those docx

1039
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:07,109
files that you see or the pptx files

1040
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:09,240
they're just<font color="#CCCCCC"> zip files and there's a zip</font>

1041
00:47:07,109 --> 00:47:12,910
files of a whole bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> XML files and</font>

1042
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:16,029
also a whole bunch of classic only for

1043
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:17,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">bat files also i can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put an image in</font>

1044
00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:19,990
there something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that image is</font>

1045
00:47:17,770 --> 00:47:24,880
inside of the zip as a file that zipped

1046
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:28,509
up so those<font color="#E5E5E5"> p 7 tip ends up being a free</font>

1047
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:30,370
analyzer for your new office documents

1048
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:32,350
you don't need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to write</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a new parser for</font>

1049
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:33,910
that you have one it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own zipper</font>

1050
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:36,670
the other thing that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice about this</font>

1051
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:38,830
tool is it pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much unzips every</font>

1052
00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:41,020
single archive format under the Sun so

1053
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:44,440
in our case what we do is we see a file

1054
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:46,600
we throw it at<font color="#CCCCCC"> P 7-zip everything goes</font>

1055
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:48,430
through that sometimes it fails and says

1056
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:50,110
it can't give us any output most of the

1057
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:51,790
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> it gives us some output it'll</font>

1058
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:53,950
actually extract all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sections out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1059
00:47:51,790 --> 00:47:58,680
an exe file it'll do the same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

1060
00:47:53,950 --> 00:48:00,700
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a mock</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh binary stuff like that um</font>

1061
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:03,220
you know it's a really great tool and a

1062
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:05,200
pull cart it'll pull out some of the

1063
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:06,459
contents of some of the installers that

1064
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,140
you've seen so like the nose lift

1065
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:09,640
install or things like that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1066
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:11,290
actually understands some versions of

1067
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:12,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">those things as well which is really</font>

1068
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:15,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">great when you're dealing with malware</font>

1069
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:16,870
that was then fed to one of those

1070
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:20,740
installer builders that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can get for</font>

1071
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:23,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">Windows and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then the setup.exe from that</font>

1072
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:26,140
was shipped to you as malware so another

1073
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:28,930
tool which may also not be obvious

1074
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:31,600
because of its a history is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool</font>

1075
00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:37,839
called exit tool which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually part</font>

1076
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:41,980
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Pearl again pearl image exif tool</font>

1077
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:44,110
project so this originally was supposed

1078
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:47,020
to extract all the exif data which is

1079
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:49,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">how your say camera like my phone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I take</font>

1080
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:52,090
a picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> with my phone it stores the it</font>

1081
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:53,950
stores information about what phone took

1082
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:55,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">a picture and everything like that in</font>

1083
00:48:53,950 --> 00:48:57,790
header information in the image this

1084
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:59,200
tool was originally put together to

1085
00:48:57,790 --> 00:49:01,390
extract that information so that you

1086
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:05,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> organize all your images if you</font>

1087
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:07,779
want somebody got a keen idea to also

1088
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:10,240
add parsers for pretty much every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single</font>

1089
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:11,710
other file header<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there so now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font>

1090
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">put a document through eggs if tool</font>

1091
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:15,400
normal give me the author<font color="#CCCCCC"> it will give</font>

1092
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:17,020
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> the original like full title</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

1093
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:19,480
document it will give me<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number of</font>

1094
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:22,840
pages in the document who last saved it

1095
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:24,670
stuff like that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I give it an exe file</font>

1096
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:25,930
it will go and pull down although my all

1097
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,350
the stuff that's typically in your

1098
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:28,690
version

1099
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:30,520
info tab in if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> right-click and go to</font>

1100
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:31,870
properties and windows it'll give you

1101
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:34,600
all the version info and stuff like that

1102
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:37,080
too it's pretty crazy but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not</font>

1103
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:39,640
necessarily obviously sold like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1104
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:41,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">recommend you know all these tools is</font>

1105
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:45,660
really great parsers to go and install

1106
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:48,250
in your malware analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> environment so</font>

1107
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:50,319
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next one that's becoming</font>

1108
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:53,740
increasingly helpful with the increase

1109
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:56,680
in say java malware and c-sharp malware

1110
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:58,689
it's stuff like that d compilers or as

1111
00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:03,569
people who aren't in the computer

1112
00:49:58,690 --> 00:50:03,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">engineering graph up there call it magic</font>

1113
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:09,970
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh you know in short d compilers will</font>

1114
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:11,500
parse like executable by code and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

1115
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:14,109
attempt to<font color="#E5E5E5"> reverse engineer it back into</font>

1116
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:16,270
source code so what you want to see is

1117
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:18,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're given a binary that's a c-sharp</font>

1118
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:20,680
executable it will pull out<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

1119
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:22,120
classes and then it will show you<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1120
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:23,649
classes plus the code that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

1121
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:26,620
functions or the methods in the classes

1122
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:29,580
stuff like that using the c-sharp

1123
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:31,390
language or C<font color="#E5E5E5"> sharp net language</font>

1124
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:34,120
similarly you can get java decompiler

1125
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:36,370
that basically do roughly the same thing

1126
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:37,779
and it's very helpful<font color="#E5E5E5"> for doing malware</font>

1127
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:39,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">analysis because if you've ever had to</font>

1128
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:42,070
step through pages and pages of like

1129
00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:43,930
java bytecode it's extremely it's

1130
00:50:42,070 --> 00:50:45,070
extremely<font color="#CCCCCC"> painful</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you might want to</font>

1131
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:47,379
shoot<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself in the head</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or something</font>

1132
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:53,380
but if you look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Java code it's a</font>

1133
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:56,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit less painful just slightly so</font>

1134
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:58,240
um what we've seen and typically where

1135
00:50:56,320 --> 00:51:00,970
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus our decompiler efforts on is</font>

1136
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:03,430
stuff that is putting net and<font color="#E5E5E5"> java and</font>

1137
00:51:00,970 --> 00:51:06,009
even flash and you might say flash like

1138
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:08,319
movies well flash basically has compiled

1139
00:51:06,010 --> 00:51:10,210
ActionScript programs but for the most

1140
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:12,550
part about is feature full is like any

1141
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:15,310
Java applet<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're nice and sharp net on</font>

1142
00:51:12,550 --> 00:51:17,050
like formula activex control but you

1143
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:20,170
know plugin for your browser or

1144
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:22,210
something um so there's also some really

1145
00:51:20,170 --> 00:51:24,670
good d compilers out there for

1146
00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:27,360
ActionScript parsing so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I included it on</font>

1147
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:29,530
here you can look at a decompiler as a

1148
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:31,540
special<font color="#E5E5E5"> class of file par so so you're</font>

1149
00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:32,800
parsing binary data and then you're

1150
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:34,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">trying to get the source code out of it</font>

1151
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:37,210
or you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a source code</font>

1152
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:41,820
out of it that might be equivalent to it

1153
00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:47,080
so um I'll put these up here<font color="#E5E5E5"> now and</font>

1154
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:49,480
this also happens to have the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

1155
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:51,580
of pairing as the debuggers<font color="#E5E5E5"> I showed to</font>

1156
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:53,740
you earlier so in these cases there are

1157
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:54,970
older tools that have a lot more history

1158
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:56,740
to them and therefore a lot more

1159
00:51:54,970 --> 00:51:58,899
documentation on the internet a lot more

1160
00:51:56,740 --> 00:52:02,259
questions that actually are answered on

1161
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:04,270
Stack Overflow things like that so like

1162
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:05,980
I else buys a great example of that but

1163
00:52:04,270 --> 00:52:07,930
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are also much more powerful tools</font>

1164
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:09,640
that have some promise to them they just

1165
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:11,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't necessarily</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have as good</font>

1166
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:13,779
documentation or a lot of familiarity in

1167
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:16,660
the community for<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> JetBrains</font>

1168
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:19,030
dot pink and actually they sell a whole

1169
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:21,490
suite of tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> for analyzing different</font>

1171
00:52:21,490 --> 00:52:26,680
net decompiler they offer and that is

1172
00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:29,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually packaged with a larger net</font>

1173
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:34,720
software analysis suite that they sell

1174
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:36,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">Java has a program</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> called jet which for</font>

1175
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:39,669
years probably more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than a decade was</font>

1176
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:42,250
like the go-to java decompiler and it

1177
00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:44,940
does an extremely good job unless your

1178
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:47,620
program happens to be compiled in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> java</font>

1179
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:51,930
version<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> six or seven or higher</font>

1180
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:56,200
which is nowadays most<font color="#CCCCCC"> java</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> code is that</font>

1181
00:52:51,930 --> 00:52:57,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay but Chad prior to that and that's</font>

1182
00:52:56,200 --> 00:53:00,129
mainly because it's not maintained

1183
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:02,020
anymore jad prior to that did a really

1184
00:53:00,130 --> 00:53:04,600
good job of doing d compilation and

1185
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:07,300
actually would run from the command line

1186
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:09,220
really well so we actually still use it

1187
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:11,170
heavily but we're also been

1188
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:12,730
investigating some other ones like the

1189
00:53:11,170 --> 00:53:16,330
java decompiler project that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've listed</font>

1190
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:18,790
up there which is again a newer one less

1191
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:20,710
history to it has a lot of promise<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

1192
00:53:18,790 --> 00:53:23,380
doesn't have a lot of experience around

1193
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:28,420
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then finally</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a flash actionscript</font>

1194
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:30,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">on this program JP exs decompiler I have</font>

1195
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:32,710
no idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the first part of that name</font>

1196
00:53:30,070 --> 00:53:34,390
means but basically it'll do the same

1197
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:38,430
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> but it'll pull the action action</font>

1198
00:53:34,390 --> 00:53:41,440
script classes out of a flash document

1199
00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:43,060
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have a flash applet or say</font>

1200
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:44,860
flash that's embedded in a word document

1201
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:47,170
or flash that's embedded in a PDF

1202
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:49,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">document which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something that is done</font>

1203
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:50,550
by the way this thing will<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

1204
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:52,890
analyze that and pull

1205
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:56,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">out source code for you used to be</font>

1206
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:58,529
called a s deck and so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> search</font>

1207
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:03,440
for it under either one of those names

1208
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:08,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you know and find it so the next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

1209
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:11,040
disassemblers what I typically use

1210
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:12,480
disassemblers for frequently is

1211
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:15,630
analyzing code that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was originally</font>

1212
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:17,160
written in C or C++ a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> backdoors</font>

1213
00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:21,000
still are written in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that especially</font>

1214
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:24,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">older ones and also a lot of obfuscation</font>

1215
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:26,220
and encryption code tends to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> written</font>

1216
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:29,640
in those as well when attackers use them

1217
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:32,040
in delivering their attacks so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1218
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:33,839
some great ones i listed the<font color="#CCCCCC"> I to free I</font>

1219
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:35,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">to pro up here that's actually one of</font>

1220
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,600
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> really popular ones there's a lot of</font>

1221
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:40,440
books written<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that it's been</font>

1222
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:42,150
around for a really long time there's an

1223
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:44,100
actual<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ida probook that's written but I</font>

1224
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:46,440
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> like Chris Eagle I think which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1225
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:48,930
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the go-to book for using that tool</font>

1226
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:53,640
one of the nice things about Ida pro

1227
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:55,589
that differs from say and<font color="#E5E5E5"> disassemble</font>

1228
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:58,049
sem on a program you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get a</font>

1229
00:54:55,590 --> 00:55:00,300
dump that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically just the pages and</font>

1230
00:54:58,050 --> 00:55:01,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">pages and pages of disassembly because</font>

1231
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:03,780
that's how your files organized<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

1232
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:08,759
your program is basically a linear

1233
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:12,660
sequence of instructions um Ida actually

1234
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:14,310
adds path discovery so even though your

1235
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:17,220
program is just a linear sequence of

1236
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:18,660
instructions when you have loops and

1237
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:20,730
when you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> functions and everything</font>

1238
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:22,350
it's basically places where your program

1239
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:24,990
jumps around<font color="#E5E5E5"> to different pieces of the</font>

1240
00:55:22,350 --> 00:55:27,480
file so Ida pro actually has some really

1241
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:29,339
great logic that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1242
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:31,680
disassembly listing and then we'll break

1243
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:33,390
out the different continuous pieces into

1244
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:35,910
blocks for you so that you can actually

1245
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:37,650
see these individual blocks and navigate

1246
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:39,480
through the program<font color="#CCCCCC"> and actually have</font>

1247
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:40,920
some organization to that long listing

1248
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:43,020
of assembly that's typically in your big

1249
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:45,840
file and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also through Rose</font>

1250
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:47,850
compiler up here so Ida is not open

1251
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:51,720
source<font color="#E5E5E5"> what Rose compiler for the most</font>

1252
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:52,799
part is and<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually has a lot it gives</font>

1253
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:57,660
you a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of visibility into the</font>

1254
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:59,210
algorithms that are behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so these</font>

00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:03,359
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've used that are helpful</font>

1256
00:55:59,210 --> 00:56:04,230
disassemblers there is a extremely large

1257
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:06,060
number of these on

1258
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:07,680
the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> and people have their</font>

1259
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:11,220
favorites these just happen to be a

00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:13,649
handful<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mine so debuggers I I</font>

1261
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:15,779
mentioned it earlier briefly for some

1262
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:17,369
reason I had<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the slide earlier but</font>

1263
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:19,290
this is a much<font color="#CCCCCC"> more detailed discussion</font>

1264
00:56:17,369 --> 00:56:21,000
of it when you're dealing with Windows

1265
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:22,500
programs there is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows debugger</font>

1266
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,119
that allow you you're probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> familiar</font>

1267
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:26,100
with and have accidentally ended up in

1268
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:30,690
it when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you wrote a program for the</font>

1269
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:33,509
first time in visual C or C++ it's it's

1270
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:35,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay but these two up here on the ollie</font>

1271
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:37,400
debug and immunity debugger<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned</font>

1272
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:39,810
earlier they're very geared towards

1273
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:42,210
malware analysis reverse engineering use

1274
00:56:39,810 --> 00:56:44,040
cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they have a lot of plugins and</font>

1275
00:56:42,210 --> 00:56:47,750
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of documentation on the internet</font>

1276
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:51,090
about those particular topics likewise

1277
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:54,030
for linux and for<font color="#CCCCCC"> mac this was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> brought</font>

1278
00:56:51,090 --> 00:56:56,520
up earlier there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> good new debugger</font>

1279
00:56:54,030 --> 00:56:58,560
so that's your standard UNIX the bugger

1280
00:56:56,520 --> 00:57:00,690
that ubiquitous across pretty much any

1281
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:04,890
system that can have a GCC compiler

1282
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:06,300
these days so if you're dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with Mac</font>

1283
00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:08,910
malware if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> dealing with Linux</font>

1284
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:10,230
malware stuff like that gdb is a really

1285
00:57:08,910 --> 00:57:13,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">great tool for it there's actually a lot</font>

1286
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:16,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">of resources on the internet that talk</font>

1287
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:18,660
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> janu debugger for the</font>

1288
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:20,490
malware analysis use case I'm not

1289
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:23,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">personally too familiar with a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

1290
00:57:20,490 --> 00:57:25,770
other debuggers for linux that focus on

1291
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:29,730
malware analysis but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone here has</font>

1292
00:57:25,770 --> 00:57:32,310
any has any ideas let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me know and then</font>

1293
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:34,230
finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the last category that I</font>

1294
00:57:32,310 --> 00:57:36,960
described in my slide earlier is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1295
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:38,430
call meta analyzers there's two that i

1296
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,960
use and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into those in a second</font>

1297
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:42,839
this is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how I look at them is</font>

1298
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:45,390
like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge Rube Goldberg machine of</font>

1299
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:47,130
malware analysis so they tend to be you

1300
00:57:45,390 --> 00:57:49,200
know drop one piece of malware in there

1301
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:50,609
and there's maybe 20 different analysis

1302
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:54,990
stages that they want to run that piece

1303
00:57:50,609 --> 00:57:58,319
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> malware through so that's kind of how</font>

1304
00:57:54,990 --> 00:57:59,549
I look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it I also see them as the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font>

1305
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:02,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">of tying things together or the</font>

1306
00:57:59,550 --> 00:58:03,570
overarching tools if you're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1307
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:04,850
get involved and say some of the

1308
00:58:03,570 --> 00:58:07,080
development around and stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that</font>

1309
00:58:04,850 --> 00:58:09,799
looking at one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these tools in</font>

1310
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:12,960
actually extending upon it is probably

1311
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:14,340
even if it's just extending it to use

1312
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:17,650
another tool that you didn't build

1313
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:19,930
yourself but you find useful into their

1314
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:22,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">Jean like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that is an extremely</font>

1315
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:24,308
<font color="#E5E5E5">beneficial contribution to the community</font>

1316
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:26,079
and probably where if you wanted to jump

1317
00:58:24,309 --> 00:58:29,829
in that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great place to jump in and</font>

1318
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:33,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">get involved so um two of my favorites</font>

1319
00:58:29,829 --> 00:58:35,859
like a boss is a total funny name

1320
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:38,250
originally released by a great group of

1321
00:58:35,859 --> 00:58:40,930
people over<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Lockheed Martin cert and</font>

1322
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:42,490
that particular tool is a huge

1323
00:58:40,930 --> 00:58:44,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">meta-analysis framework so it has</font>

1324
00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:46,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">plug-ins for all sorts of different</font>

1325
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:48,849
analysis tools out there it also has

1326
00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:51,250
hooks in there that integrate with your

1327
00:58:48,849 --> 00:58:53,730
ax at various different<font color="#E5E5E5"> stages so you</font>

1328
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:56,380
can write your rules not just to

1329
00:58:53,730 --> 00:59:00,240
identify malicious behavior but also did

1330
00:58:56,380 --> 00:59:02,740
you file categorization and everything I

1331
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:04,118
with this slide I could not begin to

1332
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:07,240
describe<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the different features that</font>

1333
00:59:04,119 --> 00:59:09,160
are in it but suffice to say it's worth

1334
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:11,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's relatively easy to</font>

1335
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:13,299
install<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> system Oh likewise on</font>

1336
00:59:11,410 --> 00:59:16,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">Mastiff is another analysis framework</font>

1337
00:59:13,299 --> 00:59:17,890
and it also comes bundled with a storage

1338
00:59:16,270 --> 00:59:20,980
system as well so it will organize

1339
00:59:17,890 --> 00:59:23,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">malware analysis for you written by a</font>

1340
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:25,630
great now our analyst<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tyler hudec who's</font>

1341
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:28,329
been in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the industry for longer than I</font>

1342
00:59:25,630 --> 00:59:31,839
have I believe he now works for

1343
00:59:28,329 --> 00:59:33,640
corelogic put this together as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1344
00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:35,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">know some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of DoD research project</font>

1345
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:37,390
or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that and he also</font>

1346
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:38,529
offers a free online service so if

1347
00:59:37,390 --> 00:59:40,660
you're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to get an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea of</font>

1348
00:59:38,529 --> 00:59:42,609
what this thing could do for you you can

1349
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:44,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually go to his website and upload</font>

1350
00:59:42,609 --> 00:59:46,299
malware samples to it and actually get

1351
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:47,920
some analysis outputs right there and I

1352
00:59:46,299 --> 00:59:49,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't listed up there on the first</font>

1353
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:52,210
link so that's another great tool to

1354
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:53,950
look into and again it's also very easy

1355
00:59:52,210 --> 00:59:55,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get installed both of these are</font>

1356
00:59:53,950 --> 01:00:00,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">written in Python and like I said</font>

1357
00:59:55,990 --> 01:00:02,439
earlier you know pearls kind of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> prose</font>

1358
01:00:00,970 --> 01:00:04,359
kind of outdated I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of</font>

1359
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:06,220
my language of choice now and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems</font>

1360
01:00:04,359 --> 01:00:08,490
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be generally the language of choice</font>

1361
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:12,339
for a lot of the security community too

1362
01:00:08,490 --> 01:00:14,799
so finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mentioned about Mastiff</font>

1363
01:00:12,339 --> 01:00:17,230
doing some malware organization for you

1364
01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:19,150
stuff like that I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dive in</font>

1365
01:00:17,230 --> 01:00:21,309
like really quickly to kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> how I</font>

1366
01:00:19,150 --> 01:00:23,650
typically organize things because you're

1367
01:00:21,309 --> 01:00:26,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">not just dealing with a directory to</font>

1368
01:00:23,650 --> 01:00:27,940
store your malware samples in when you

1369
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:29,289
run it through these parsers and through

1370
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:31,450
these analyzers that I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked to</font>

1371
01:00:29,289 --> 01:00:33,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">you about you're also getting other out</font>

1372
01:00:31,450 --> 01:00:35,890
from those you're getting maybe a list

1373
01:00:33,370 --> 01:00:36,940
of the if you ran it through eggs if

1374
01:00:35,890 --> 01:00:38,890
tool you're getting a list of all the

1375
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:41,530
file headers if you ran it through if

1376
01:00:38,890 --> 01:00:43,750
you had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> set up dot exe that you ran</font>

1377
01:00:41,530 --> 01:00:45,790
through p 7 zip it actually pulled out

1378
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:49,150
maybe the DLLs and the exe s that we're

1379
01:00:45,790 --> 01:00:50,350
inside of that setup.exe as well you

1380
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:52,570
actually want to store those things

1381
01:00:50,350 --> 01:00:54,370
somewhere so that they're collected

1382
01:00:52,570 --> 01:00:57,940
close to the original file you got them

1383
01:00:54,370 --> 01:00:59,200
from so what I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been doing mainly I</font>

1384
01:00:57,940 --> 01:01:01,650
look at it from the point of view of

1385
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:04,290
like your file system is a really good a

1386
01:01:01,650 --> 01:01:06,730
hierarchical database itself so

1387
01:01:04,290 --> 01:01:11,009
generally what I end up doing again

1388
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:14,230
malware zoo you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know term of the day</font>

1389
01:01:11,010 --> 01:01:15,580
I'll have underneath<font color="#CCCCCC"> malware's you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

1390
01:01:14,230 --> 01:01:17,020
you know i'll just create a new malware

1391
01:01:15,580 --> 01:01:18,819
zoo folder and then underneath that

1392
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:20,680
every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get a malware sample</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font>

1393
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:22,540
create a new folder for it and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

1394
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:24,250
drop it into the folder so we'll drop a

1395
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:26,800
copy of the actual file in there and

1396
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:28,270
maybe similan get so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can remember when</font>

1397
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:30,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">I come back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this two years from now</font>

1398
01:01:28,270 --> 01:01:32,320
what I was thinking and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

1399
01:01:30,850 --> 01:01:34,480
the malware sample that was in this

1400
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:36,730
folder was so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I used like the Linux</font>

1401
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:38,500
symlinks to give me a hint there and

1402
01:01:36,730 --> 01:01:40,510
then for each one of these tools that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1403
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:42,880
just talked about I may create a folder

1404
01:01:40,510 --> 01:01:44,590
for each one of them and then dump the

1405
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:47,380
output files from each<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of those</font>

1406
01:01:44,590 --> 01:01:51,580
tools into this sub folder so that now I

1407
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:53,650
know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I have at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this level like</font>

1408
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:54,910
2,000 malware analysis projects that

1409
01:01:53,650 --> 01:01:57,970
I've worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> on over the past three years</font>

1410
01:01:54,910 --> 01:02:01,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">if I go into any one of them and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

1411
01:01:57,970 --> 01:02:04,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">to see say what the ida pro artifacts</font>

1412
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:06,640
were so I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see what I was working</font>

1413
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:09,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">on a night of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> promos I can always</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

1414
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:10,960
into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ida pro artifacts water or if i</font>

1415
01:02:09,010 --> 01:02:13,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the logs from running all</font>

1416
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:15,220
these files in my cuckoo sandboxes<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1417
01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:17,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually have one folder that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i've got</font>

1418
01:02:15,220 --> 01:02:19,540
all those put in there likewise<font color="#CCCCCC"> if i</font>

1419
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:23,170
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to share everything i learned about</font>

1420
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:25,690
artifact<font color="#E5E5E5"> one exe with nate because he's</font>

1421
01:02:23,170 --> 01:02:27,820
a friend of mine and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I trust him and he</font>

1422
01:02:25,690 --> 01:02:29,440
hasn't seen this file before I can just

1423
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:31,330
zip up that folder and I can give it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1424
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:33,130
him and as long as I've explained this

1425
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:35,410
to him once he's going to be pretty

1426
01:02:33,130 --> 01:02:36,970
familiar<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that art of that bundle</font>

1427
01:02:35,410 --> 01:02:39,279
plus all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> future bundles I give to</font>

1428
01:02:36,970 --> 01:02:42,910
them as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well so it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a pretty simple</font>

1429
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:45,370
stupid organization but it works and it

1430
01:02:42,910 --> 01:02:47,440
works pretty well<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's a lot easier</font>

1431
01:02:45,370 --> 01:02:50,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">maintained on a case-by-case basis than</font>

1432
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:52,090
say creating a SQL table for all these

1433
01:02:50,170 --> 01:02:53,710
things to organize<font color="#CCCCCC"> Omer sqlite or</font>

1434
01:02:52,090 --> 01:02:56,350
something like that which aren't bad

1435
01:02:53,710 --> 01:02:58,780
solutions by any stretch of the way but

1436
01:02:56,350 --> 01:03:02,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know if it ends up being something</font>

1437
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:04,090
that is a little bit of a complication

1438
01:03:02,410 --> 01:03:06,069
to do then it ends up being something

1439
01:03:04,090 --> 01:03:07,810
you're more likely to skip Ewing when

1440
01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:09,490
you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the job done so</font>

1441
01:03:07,810 --> 01:03:11,860
here this is an organizational approach

1442
01:03:09,490 --> 01:03:13,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> found is very easy for me because it's</font>

1443
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:15,430
quick and dirty which means I'm more

1444
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:17,890
likely to actually do it whenever I need

1445
01:03:15,430 --> 01:03:21,190
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it and I'm more likely to do it</font>

1446
01:03:17,890 --> 01:03:24,670
repeatedly so consistently I<font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

1447
01:03:21,190 --> 01:03:26,710
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's pretty much it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

1448
01:03:24,670 --> 01:03:32,010
any questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we have like five</font>

1449
01:03:26,710 --> 01:03:37,320
minutes left or something six minutes so

1450
01:03:32,010 --> 01:03:37,320
all right all right everyone thank you

1451
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:37,400
I imagine you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do it in AWS pilots</font>

1452
01:04:57,279 --> 01:05:00,279
ok
