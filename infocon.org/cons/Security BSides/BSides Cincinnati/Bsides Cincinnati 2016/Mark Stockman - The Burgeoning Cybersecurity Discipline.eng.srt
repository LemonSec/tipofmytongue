our next<font color="#E5E5E5"> topic right thanks Nate so I</font>

21
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:43,150
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my talk with a</font>

22
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:46,360
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> stories so twice in my career</font>

23
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:49,299
I've been hired as kind of a second

24
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:52,690
thought right so the people they thought

25
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:54,940
they wanted to hire at first they tried

26
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:56,170
with them and then they came to me so

27
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:59,859
I've been a second thought a couple

28
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:02,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">times in my life in my career the first</font>

29
00:02:59,859 --> 00:03:04,780
time was<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was working at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a non-profit</font>

30
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:08,019
which was pretty cool I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

31
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:09,340
fun things with technology but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> wasn't</font>

32
00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:11,079
getting paid anything and then they

33
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,060
moved me an account into an accounting

34
00:03:11,079 --> 00:03:17,139
role which I didn't like and I wasn't

35
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:20,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">very good at so i took a contract</font>

36
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:24,370
position at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Armco steel in coshocton</font>

37
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:26,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">ohio which was pretty cool but what I</font>

38
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,730
found out is that I was a little bit

39
00:03:26,109 --> 00:03:29,230
worried because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know they were</font>

40
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:31,328
looking for all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> different skills</font>

41
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:33,608
that i didn't think i had but i think

42
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:35,440
the contract company kind of talked me

43
00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:37,930
up a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than why i was so i was a</font>

44
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">little worried going into this job but</font>

45
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:41,739
pretty quickly after a couple weeks I

46
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:45,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">was kind of into things I was doing some</font>

47
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:47,560
development with with<font color="#CCCCCC"> C and Excel Mike</font>

48
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,239
macros and it was this quality control

49
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,489
system it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was pretty cool but what I</font>

50
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:56,230
found out was that again I was kind of a

51
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:58,209
second thought so my bosses<font color="#E5E5E5"> were we're</font>

52
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:01,030
hiring a lot of computer science

53
00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:02,319
graduates right out of college thinking

54
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:04,480
well you know we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing development</font>

55
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,069
we're hiring computer science grads to

56
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,349
do this and what they learned is that

57
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:11,230
these grads rather<font color="#CCCCCC"> the heist out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

58
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:12,760
college couldn't impact their company

59
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:14,590
very much you took them you know six

60
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,358
<font color="#CCCCCC">months to get him ramped up and by that</font>

61
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:18,070
time a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these kids would leave</font>

62
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:20,140
because they<font color="#E5E5E5"> hated coshocton is this</font>

63
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:22,510
hole tiny town right I'm sorry was the

64
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:24,110
second thought right so you know I

65
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:25,669
didn't have a computer science degree

66
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:28,789
had an industrial and systems

67
00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:30,710
engineering degree so I really didn't

68
00:04:28,789 --> 00:04:33,169
have the traditional match what they

69
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:35,508
thought they were looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the second</font>

70
00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:36,859
time was my current job I'm a faculty

71
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:41,419
member here at the University of

72
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:43,069
Cincinnati so again they were hired they

73
00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:45,109
were interviewing<font color="#E5E5E5"> folks and I realized</font>

74
00:04:43,069 --> 00:04:48,169
again I was in this kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of second round</font>

75
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:49,580
well let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> try it again the first round</font>

76
00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:54,109
they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> interviewing for the</font>

77
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:56,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">traditional PhD holding candidates which</font>

78
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:58,819
is fine for a lot of faculty positions

79
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:01,159
but at this time about 15 years ago you

80
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:02,930
see was starting an applied computing

81
00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:05,688
degree they called it computer science

82
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:10,069
technology and so they're interviewing

83
00:05:05,689 --> 00:05:12,259
these PhD folks holding PhD computer

84
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:14,240
science computer engineers who are great

85
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:16,849
did great research but they couldn't

86
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,819
really teach the applied computing in

87
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:21,620
the.com boom and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> again I kind of ran</font>

88
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,909
into this situation where the

89
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,889
organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought they wanted</font>

90
00:05:22,909 --> 00:05:27,080
something and then either through

91
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:29,750
interviews or through kind of tripping

92
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,550
up they found all that traditional what

93
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,440
we thought we wanted isn't actually

94
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:35,719
didn't actually fit what we're trying to

95
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,810
do here and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's really the basis</font>

96
00:05:35,719 --> 00:05:41,599
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the talk today is okay we're kind of</font>

97
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:44,389
at this space in<font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber security right so</font>

98
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:46,878
you know you guys are perhaps some of

99
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:50,150
you are hiring folks out of computer

100
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:51,830
science or IT or is and you need some

101
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:54,469
specific skills but maybe you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

102
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:56,628
finding the right type of folks or for

103
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:58,250
your students maybe you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for a</font>

104
00:05:56,629 --> 00:06:01,879
job you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure exactly what are the</font>

105
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:03,699
jobs out there right and so this what

106
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:06,830
this talk is about is this movement

107
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:09,680
nationally to create kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of guidelines</font>

108
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:11,779
on what should a cybersecurity degree

109
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,089
program a four-year degree program look

110
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:16,250
like right so which what kind of skills

111
00:06:14,089 --> 00:06:18,500
and abilities should students have

112
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:21,699
coming out of a program like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so</font>

113
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:24,770
that's kind of what this talk is about

114
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:28,069
so I you start off<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of my talks</font>

115
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:30,799
with this this caricature which was made

116
00:06:28,069 --> 00:06:33,590
about 30 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago amazingly enough it</font>

117
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">kings island so you go and you sit down</font>

118
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,830
they say you know what do you like to do

119
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:38,960
and I like computers<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like you know</font>

120
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:41,539
banging on the trs-80 that we had at

121
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,340
school and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so they made this little</font>

122
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:46,340
cartoon if you haven't seen war games

123
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:48,020
it's a classic right and so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> never</font>

124
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:50,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">really got into trouble doing this type</font>

125
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:52,700
of thing although my first job<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a</font>

126
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,130
co-op student i did have military police

127
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:58,070
show up at my cubicle working for the

128
00:06:55,130 --> 00:07:01,460
DoD i'll tell you that story over a beer

129
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:03,830
if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear that so I told that</font>

130
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">story I was at a defense contractors</font>

131
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:09,020
conference up in Dayton last week and

132
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:11,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">got a guy's got some ooze with that so</font>

133
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:16,099
so I never<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got into trouble but</font>

134
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:19,280
this was me 30 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago back in when I</font>

135
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:22,120
was junior high in high school and<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

136
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:25,479
have I gone<font color="#E5E5E5"> to well not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> far</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

137
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:28,430
so I've now become the the professor

138
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:31,220
teaching these types of things so again

139
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:33,280
still hack and<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on computers but a</font>

140
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:36,260
little bit nerdy or maybe some

141
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,059
stereotypes in there as I've gotten

142
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:40,250
through this<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff so before I get into</font>

143
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:43,250
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> discipline I wanted to just mention</font>

144
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:45,080
a few words about some of the research i

145
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:47,720
do that's not connected<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

146
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:50,750
discipline per se but just to<font color="#CCCCCC"> give you</font>

147
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:53,810
an idea of what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i do other than teaching</font>

148
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:55,970
students so I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> this cartoon which I</font>

149
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:58,640
which pretty much epitomizes what my

150
00:07:55,970 --> 00:08:00,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">research team does so since we've</font>

151
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:03,500
narrowed down our security risks down to

152
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:05,539
these two groups right so everyone who

153
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:08,390
works here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and everyone who doesn't work</font>

154
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:10,580
here right so so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you know really</font>

155
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:12,979
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys do an industry right</font>

156
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:14,390
either<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus on the bad guys or your</font>

157
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:18,590
focus on you know security<font color="#CCCCCC"> awareness</font>

158
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:20,060
training and so what I've done over so

159
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:22,280
again I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been working in this field</font>

160
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:25,550
and and realize things aren't<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting</font>

161
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:29,119
much better right so I decided to embed

162
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:30,260
myself with some criminologists here at

163
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,460
the University of Cincinnati if you

164
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:36,620
don't know it's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the top three</font>

165
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:38,540
criminology departments in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world the</font>

166
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:40,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">output of the research that's done here</font>

167
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:43,010
in criminal justice<font color="#E5E5E5"> and criminology is</font>

168
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:44,600
second to none in the world is fantastic

169
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:46,580
so I embedded myself with these

170
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,820
researchers for about three years to try

171
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,290
to

172
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:50,840
a well you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you guys have been</font>

173
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:53,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">studying you know crime prevention and</font>

174
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,830
criminology for hundreds of years you

175
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,540
know is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> something there and</font>

176
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:58,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's actually been there are some</font>

177
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:01,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">good research on stopping traditional</font>

178
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:03,380
crime or the past 30 years there's been

179
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:05,650
this precipitous drop in court street

180
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:08,720
crime and it's all based on some

181
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:10,610
theoretically backed empirically driven

182
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,710
research so what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> decided to do is</font>

183
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:14,230
embed myself with them and say can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

184
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:17,000
use some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the research from</font>

185
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:19,160
criminology and victim ology and really

186
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,110
impact what we do in<font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber security and</font>

187
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:24,680
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> research team and I do</font>

188
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:27,170
were diatomic cyber security if you're

189
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:29,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">interested in and working with us what</font>

190
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:33,189
we do is we focus on the actions of non

191
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:37,070
malicious insiders we use an empirical

192
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:39,500
methodology to really tease out risk of

193
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:41,720
data breach at three levels at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

194
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:44,300
organizational level so your

195
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:47,120
organization based on size type location

196
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:48,319
you know what your risk based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that at</font>

197
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,840
the department level do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

198
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,390
departments that are more at risk for

199
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:55,220
divulged sensitive information as other

200
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:57,800
departments and at the individual level

201
00:09:55,220 --> 00:10:00,200
right so do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have specific employees</font>

202
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:03,229
that need some real good mitigation

203
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:06,680
based on what they're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we come</font>

204
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:08,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">up we come at that really threw three</font>

205
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,160
different ways we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a database</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

206
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:12,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">we started with the privacy rights</font>

207
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">clearinghouse database of thousands of</font>

208
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:17,270
day breaches and then we've taken that

209
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:20,030
database and added a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of attributes</font>

210
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:22,130
to the data to try to tease out<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

211
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:24,730
what types of organizations suffer what

212
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:28,460
types of risks based on employee actions

213
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:30,800
we use employee surveys to get at you

214
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:34,010
know why are our employees acting this

215
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,120
way right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we don't know and</font>

216
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:37,220
we just throw security awareness

217
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,470
training at them but their boss is

218
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:41,330
saying hey we're driving revenue don't

219
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:43,430
restart that<font color="#E5E5E5"> server right don't patch</font>

220
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:44,840
we're driving revenue then the security

221
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:46,819
awareness training may not work so we

222
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,650
really you know we do surveys to try to

223
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:50,090
figure out you know what's motivating

224
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:52,370
these employees to act the way there

225
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:55,220
they are we also do interviews with the

226
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:58,730
employees and then we match these data

227
00:10:55,220 --> 00:11:00,110
up against your vulnerability scan data

228
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:01,610
right so we match

229
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:03,769
is your bonds responsible for what

230
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:06,980
systems what's the time to mitigation

231
00:11:03,769 --> 00:11:08,899
for these systems and compare those

232
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:12,140
against the data that we're collecting

233
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:14,899
and then we use this assessment to feed

234
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:16,970
into mitigation strategies again

235
00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:19,209
borrowing from criminology and victim

236
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:22,610
ology using empirically driven

237
00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:26,599
customized solutions and that's me with

238
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:28,970
my criminology focused<font color="#CCCCCC"> partner so one of</font>

239
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,339
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a professor here one just took a</font>

240
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:32,899
job at Indiana State but will still be

241
00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:35,269
working together so again we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

242
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:36,890
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the causes for the behaviors and</font>

243
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:41,630
motivations of employees<font color="#CCCCCC"> and how they</font>

244
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:44,720
affect data breach<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so digging</font>

245
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:48,560
into the real part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

246
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:50,209
so so that's my research coming back to

247
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,939
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> I talked about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple jobs</font>

248
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:54,768
I've had so I am a faculty member here

249
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:58,100
at the University of Cincinnati out of

250
00:11:54,769 --> 00:12:00,790
the school of information technology so

251
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:03,740
at you see we have cyber security

252
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:06,079
scattered about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> university so we're</font>

253
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:07,579
a comprehensive<font color="#CCCCCC"> university we have it</font>

254
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,800
out of the school of IT which is where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

255
00:12:07,579 --> 00:12:11,300
am which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an applied computing I'll</font>

256
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk more about that in a minute we</font>

257
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,439
obviously have it out of computer

258
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:17,029
science we have it out of a math<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

259
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,399
you some cryptography type stuff out of

260
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:22,730
there out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the school of law so our</font>

261
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:24,050
law school does some<font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber security who</font>

262
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:27,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">I missed in business those cyber</font>

263
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:29,990
security political science does policy

264
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,819
level<font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber security I actually teach a</font>

265
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:33,829
class with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the head of our political</font>

266
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:35,899
science department we call cyber attack

267
00:12:33,829 --> 00:12:37,819
which is a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of fun we put students in</font>

268
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:40,279
teams and they come up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> potential</font>

269
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:43,010
attacks against organizations and we

270
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:45,500
roleplay those so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fun so</font>

271
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:51,050
we all work together in doing cyber at

272
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:58,160
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> university sewer man let's see we</font>

273
00:12:51,050 --> 00:13:00,859
are also now have NSA DHS certifications

274
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:03,439
as centers for academic excellence in

275
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,850
cyber defense and cyber operations so

276
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,769
we're one of a few universities that

277
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:09,230
have the dual designation of those two

278
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:11,209
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about what that means in a</font>

279
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:13,819
couple minutes

280
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:17,209
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think where I'm going to go with</font>

281
00:13:13,819 --> 00:13:18,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">this all right so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> coming back to again</font>

282
00:13:17,209 --> 00:13:21,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">the school of IT and what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was hired</font>

283
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:25,040
into i'm going to talk about kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

284
00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:26,749
this movement of IT in the disciplines

285
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,990
because i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it matches a lot what's</font>

286
00:13:26,749 --> 00:13:32,119
happening now with with cyber security

287
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:34,300
so again about 15 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago you see was</font>

288
00:13:32,119 --> 00:13:37,249
creating this applied computing program

289
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:39,079
because businesses like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Armco steel and</font>

290
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:41,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">coshocton we're having</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problems getting</font>

291
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:43,819
CS grads who could actually implement

292
00:13:41,689 --> 00:13:45,498
things and apply some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the theories</font>

293
00:13:43,819 --> 00:13:47,748
they were learning<font color="#CCCCCC"> in computer science</font>

294
00:13:45,499 --> 00:13:50,089
so there are universities across the

295
00:13:47,749 --> 00:13:55,610
country who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> building similar</font>

296
00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:57,649
programs at<font color="#CCCCCC"> purdue at BYU at RIT</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DePaul</font>

297
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:59,769
so a lot of universities were doing this

298
00:13:57,649 --> 00:14:02,240
creating these applied computing

299
00:13:59,769 --> 00:14:03,410
programs out there and that's what we

300
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,800
did<font color="#CCCCCC"> here at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the University of Cincinnati</font>

301
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:08,179
as well until I'll talk a minute a

302
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,099
little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so again i</font>

303
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:12,110
teach out of a school<font color="#E5E5E5"> of IT which is</font>

304
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:14,629
more of an applied computing we<font color="#E5E5E5"> teach</font>

305
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:16,999
enough theory so that students can adapt

306
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:18,889
to new technologies and so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

307
00:14:16,999 --> 00:14:22,689
troubleshoot when things go wrong but

308
00:14:18,889 --> 00:14:25,549
we're much<font color="#E5E5E5"> more of a tactical program</font>

309
00:14:22,689 --> 00:14:26,868
than computer science was more theory

310
00:14:25,549 --> 00:14:28,759
based we'll talk more about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

311
00:14:26,869 --> 00:14:31,699
minute so again in 15 years here

312
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:34,129
teaching systems courses cloud computing

313
00:14:31,699 --> 00:14:37,699
infrastructure as a service data center

314
00:14:34,129 --> 00:14:40,220
operations network security<font color="#E5E5E5"> this cyber</font>

315
00:14:37,699 --> 00:14:43,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">tag class so in the systems networking</font>

316
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:47,089
security type of areas over the past 15

317
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:48,799
years so these universities is we got

318
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:51,649
together you know putting together

319
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:53,540
applied computing programs we said well

320
00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:55,459
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to get together to form</font>

321
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:57,019
kind of a group to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what does</font>

322
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:59,029
it mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> to create these applied</font>

323
00:14:57,019 --> 00:15:01,269
computing programs and we aligned

324
00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:03,470
ourselves with ACM which is the biggest

325
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:05,649
computing professional<font color="#E5E5E5"> society in the</font>

326
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:10,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">world we became a special interest group</font>

327
00:15:05,649 --> 00:15:12,410
under ACM for IT education we landed on

328
00:15:10,069 --> 00:15:14,889
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> word this name for the do business</font>

329
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:19,370
the discipline information technology

330
00:15:14,889 --> 00:15:21,079
which again is an applied computing area

331
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:22,300
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> ACMs other special interest groups</font>

332
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:26,140
you may have heard of

333
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:29,439
siggraph sig chi some other major

334
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:31,330
players in computing so I've been

335
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">involved with ACM and this special</font>

336
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,810
interest group<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was their chair for</font>

337
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:36,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">about three years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I hosted the</font>

338
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:38,979
conference here in Cincinnati one year

339
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:40,930
which was pretty cool and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are a</font>

340
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:44,230
few<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us hear from you see who</font>

341
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:48,579
participated<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this creation of IT as a</font>

342
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:52,630
specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> discipline under ACM a bet and</font>

343
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:55,720
see sab are the accreditation boards for

344
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:57,300
computing so programs if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

345
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:00,400
get accredited for computer science

346
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:03,699
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> systems computer engineering</font>

347
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:05,650
information technology they go through a

348
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:07,480
bet or the computing Sciences

349
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:09,160
Accreditation Board so I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

350
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,340
involved<font color="#CCCCCC"> with them for several years so</font>

351
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:14,680
I go<font color="#CCCCCC"> out on site to universities and go</font>

352
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:16,600
through their IT curriculum talk to

353
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:19,959
students and faculty and we actually

354
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:23,020
designate accreditation for these

355
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:25,420
programs around the country so I'm very

356
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:30,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">involved</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in that with that as well I'm</font>

357
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:33,150
on the computing criteria committee of a

358
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:35,650
bet and so what we do is we take

359
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:37,660
recommendations for changes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

360
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:40,480
accreditation guidelines and that we

361
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:42,300
kind of implement those into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the system</font>

362
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,910
so we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working a lot this year</font>

363
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:48,520
the big maybe surprising thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

364
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:51,339
now to get accredited as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer</font>

365
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:53,890
science program you do not need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to offer</font>

366
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:56,110
or require any<font color="#E5E5E5"> come any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cybersecurity</font>

367
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:57,610
course at work and you can get

368
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:59,530
accredited you may have seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> recently</font>

369
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:02,410
there's a report that showed at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top</font>

370
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:05,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">ten computer science country degrees in</font>

371
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:08,170
the country none of them required any

372
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:11,890
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of security coursework and only two</font>

373
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:14,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">of them had security electives of the</font>

374
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:16,300
top 50 computer science programs in the

375
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,909
country<font color="#E5E5E5"> only three</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of them required</font>

376
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:22,210
security courses it's pretty amazing

377
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:24,670
luckily we here at UC do require in the

378
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:28,150
computer science do require cyber pretty

379
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:29,500
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> nku does as well so so we're seeing</font>

380
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:31,180
this so this is a big<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're</font>

381
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:33,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">working on then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the criteria committee</font>

382
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:35,200
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to infuse to make</font>

383
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:37,960
sure that in the future computer science

384
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,940
programs will require some security and

385
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:43,570
it's amazing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pushback that we get</font>

386
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:46,630
from some computer science faculty about

387
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:49,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">that so again this is kind of where I'm</font>

388
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:52,180
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> bens the university working with ACM</font>

389
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:54,630
to help define IT as a discipline and

390
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:57,640
working with the accrediting agencies on

391
00:17:54,630 --> 00:18:00,880
you know what should be a credited

392
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:02,890
program and then actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> going out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

393
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:08,260
helping with the accreditation on some

394
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:12,310
of these things<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so i talked</font>

395
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:14,860
about ACM about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years ago when</font>

396
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:16,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">information technology was coming</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

397
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:18,520
its own as we were defining well what

398
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:21,280
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it mean to deliver an information</font>

399
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:23,920
technology program ACM published a

400
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:26,410
report of all the computing disciplines

401
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,730
and kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> described what each of them</font>

402
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:29,980
should look like what they should

403
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:32,110
include and why is this important again

404
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:35,470
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to it's important so that when</font>

405
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:38,080
you are hiring folks in in your

406
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:39,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">companies so you know hey if I hire</font>

407
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,530
somebody from computer science program

408
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,120
that's accredited I know they're at

409
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:45,370
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have these things when</font>

410
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,689
they come in right and again what we're

411
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:48,340
working on is in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> future</font>

412
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:49,690
cybersecurity you'll know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're</font>

413
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:51,370
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have these these things</font>

414
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:54,460
specifically so one nice thing about

415
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:57,669
this report from ACM it created<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

416
00:18:54,460 --> 00:19:00,700
graphs that you can see here it put the

417
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:03,340
computing space and on the y-axis it

418
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:05,860
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay in computing we deal with all</font>

419
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:07,990
the way up to organizations so we hire

420
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:10,030
IT employees and how can we affect how

421
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:13,210
they work all the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> down the computer</font>

422
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:16,840
hardware right and then then on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

423
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:19,900
x-axis here we have you know some

424
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:22,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">programs need to do hi theory right we</font>

425
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:24,460
need to know about algorithms others

426
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:26,139
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do more with development and so</font>

427
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:31,240
they took the computing disciplines and

428
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:32,800
they mapped them on to this this this

429
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,110
chart here<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you can see I put</font>

430
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:37,419
computer science and IT just to show you

431
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:39,550
kind of where they fit as you might

432
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:41,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">expect computer science students do a</font>

433
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:43,930
little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> theory right they learn</font>

434
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,950
all those all those specific technical

435
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:48,470
things and theory based things and

436
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:50,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">well you know registers work and RAM and</font>

437
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:52,880
and very theoretical types of things

438
00:19:50,809 --> 00:19:55,668
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they obviously do push into</font>

439
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:58,309
some application but not specifically

440
00:19:55,669 --> 00:20:00,470
you know out to the setting things up

441
00:19:58,309 --> 00:20:03,080
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then it's-- kind of the mirror</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> image</font>

442
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:04,880
of computer science so our students come

443
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:08,059
out they know how to set things up how

444
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">to integrate things and obviously how to</font>

445
00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:11,990
secure things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've always had that as</font>

446
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:15,350
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our curriculum and IT so again</font>

447
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:18,139
this is what the major computing<font color="#CCCCCC"> society</font>

448
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:20,209
says that these programs kind of do and

449
00:20:18,139 --> 00:20:22,279
of course each program is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a</font>

450
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:24,139
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right so computer</font>

451
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:25,519
science at UC is going to be a little

452
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:28,699
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> different than computer science at</font>

453
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:33,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">nku but generally they fall kind of in</font>

454
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:35,539
this area right so any questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

455
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:37,340
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of where this is or by the way if</font>

456
00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:39,559
you have any questions or comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel</font>

457
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:48,289
free to throw something<font color="#CCCCCC"> at me or for a</font>

458
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:52,129
raise<font color="#E5E5E5"> your hand yeah we we have not yet</font>

459
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:56,120
we've tried we've tried a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

460
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:57,710
times where we've had problems you see

461
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,989
with the questions has you see

462
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:01,610
participated in cyber defense is because

463
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:04,130
we offer co-op which is a great thing

464
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:05,990
about our program it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> also hurts with</font>

465
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:07,909
student groups because they would rather

466
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:09,679
be going out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and making money that</font>

467
00:21:07,909 --> 00:21:11,570
actually participating in a group so we

468
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">get a lot of excitement for student</font>

469
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:15,049
groups in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> freshman year before they</font>

470
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:17,690
go up then they go co-op and they say oh

471
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:20,210
wait I'm actually making money here so

472
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:22,460
weak that we've had difficulty in<font color="#CCCCCC"> ku's</font>

473
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:24,679
done it quite a bit every<font color="#CCCCCC"> year they do</font>

474
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:26,630
the cyber defense we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> hoping that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

475
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:28,100
can start ramping up and doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that some</font>

476
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:30,529
more but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we have the</font>

477
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:32,360
problems that you see again<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a great</font>

478
00:21:30,529 --> 00:21:34,309
thing we have co-op but that's the

479
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:36,320
downside sometimes a lot of our students

480
00:21:34,309 --> 00:21:38,240
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> when they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not co-op in their</font>

481
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:41,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">companies higher than part time to work</font>

482
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:43,630
while they're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> school so we've</font>

483
00:21:41,059 --> 00:21:43,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that problem</font>

484
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,259
so the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is why aren't these</font>

485
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:15,539
computer science programs requiring

486
00:22:13,259 --> 00:22:18,450
security in their programs is it market

487
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:21,269
demand or is it something else I really

488
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:23,489
think it has to do with the the faculty

489
00:22:21,269 --> 00:22:26,159
saying you know this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just another</font>

490
00:22:23,489 --> 00:22:29,070
piece of computing you know we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

491
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:32,099
with the theory it shouldn't be required

492
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:34,439
of every computer science a student

493
00:22:32,099 --> 00:22:37,678
coming out so we faculty are

494
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:39,769
historically slow moving on things so

495
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,999
again some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it comes just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to us</font>

496
00:22:39,769 --> 00:22:44,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">faculty and you know a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

497
00:22:41,999 --> 00:22:46,259
programs<font color="#E5E5E5"> are jam packed already so we're</font>

498
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:48,239
saying okay if we're going to include

499
00:22:46,259 --> 00:22:50,460
something new what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we going to take</font>

500
00:22:48,239 --> 00:22:51,899
out right so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's been some of</font>

501
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:56,909
it within the some of the computer

502
00:22:51,899 --> 00:22:59,039
science<font color="#E5E5E5"> degree programs so if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a</font>

503
00:22:56,909 --> 00:23:02,279
full answer but that's my opinion on

504
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:04,169
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and again not all computer</font>

505
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:07,470
science programs ignore it certainly

506
00:23:04,169 --> 00:23:09,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay to show you a couple other</font>

507
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:11,429
computing disciplines information

508
00:23:09,479 --> 00:23:13,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">systems these are the business folks</font>

509
00:23:11,429 --> 00:23:16,379
right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dealing with obviously</font>

510
00:23:13,889 --> 00:23:18,809
the organization a lot more with some

511
00:23:16,379 --> 00:23:20,908
implementation the computer engineers as

512
00:23:18,809 --> 00:23:22,499
you might expect our down in the

513
00:23:20,909 --> 00:23:25,679
hardware right there doing embedded

514
00:23:22,499 --> 00:23:28,529
systems Internet of Things things like

515
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:30,899
that right so is that a this defense

516
00:23:28,529 --> 00:23:32,369
contractors conference a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks</font>

517
00:23:30,899 --> 00:23:34,709
ago in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dayton they're really interested</font>

518
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:36,830
in they needing security folks that are

519
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:39,690
computer engineers they're building a

520
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:42,389
weapon systems and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

521
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:46,619
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of how a CM has</font>

522
00:23:42,389 --> 00:23:48,809
designated these disciplines so what

523
00:23:46,619 --> 00:23:50,609
I've come up with looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this stuff</font>

524
00:23:48,809 --> 00:23:53,639
is really these different disciplines

525
00:23:50,609 --> 00:23:56,129
answer different questions right so the

526
00:23:53,639 --> 00:23:57,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">is folks answer the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question why do we</font>

527
00:23:56,129 --> 00:23:59,459
need it so they're involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

528
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,769
business they know how the business runs

529
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:03,389
they know where there's a problem right

530
00:24:01,769 --> 00:24:06,059
where they need to be more efficient<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

531
00:24:03,389 --> 00:24:07,830
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> is folks really understand the</font>

532
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:09,629
business process<font color="#CCCCCC"> and understand we need</font>

533
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:10,379
a better efficiency here we need a

534
00:24:09,629 --> 00:24:12,929
network or

535
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:14,550
database right and then our computer

536
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:16,590
scientists and our<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer engineers</font>

537
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:19,020
answer the question well<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do we make</font>

538
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:21,090
that tool how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we make that operating</font>

539
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:23,340
system how do we make that router device

540
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:25,020
right so the Intel's the world are

541
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:27,300
dealing with computer engineers right

542
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:30,090
the Microsoft's with computer scientists

543
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:32,520
and then us and IT we're worried about

544
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:34,530
well how do we make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it work so how do we</font>

545
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:36,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">apply these tools that were created by</font>

546
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:38,970
computer scientists and future engineers

547
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:40,740
and apply them to the problems that are

548
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:43,530
being identified by our information

549
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:45,960
systems folks so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of one way</font>

550
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:47,430
that I like to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this as we go</font>

551
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">forward and of course we'll talk about a</font>

552
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:52,560
minute well where does<font color="#CCCCCC"> where's cyber</font>

553
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:55,110
security and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all this one other kind of</font>

554
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:57,750
a separation that I like to put in here

555
00:24:55,110 --> 00:25:00,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">is as when we started creating this</font>

556
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:01,710
applied computing program one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

557
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:03,449
major selling points that we would tell

558
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:05,940
our students is you can get a job

559
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:08,910
anywhere right so we have student one of

560
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:11,790
our graduates it works with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bengals</font>

561
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:14,460
downtown one of the works with ESPN

562
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:18,450
others work at schools at universities

563
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:20,040
at banks so the IT graduates really work

564
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:22,860
everywhere and the same can be said for

565
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:25,530
information systems graduates and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

566
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:29,100
what I do is I put this look sorry I put

567
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:33,000
this line here I can't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> see this</font>

568
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:37,050
myself<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so to the to the right</font>

569
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,240
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the line this is kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what i call</font>

570
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:41,129
ubiquity they can get jobs anywhere

571
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,020
right it's not specific to an industry

572
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:44,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">where as a computer scientist and</font>

573
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:46,830
computer engineers they're being hired

574
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:48,330
by the Microsoft's and the Intel's in

575
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:50,760
the Defense Department so there's really

576
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:55,580
an industry for those who are making the

577
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:58,770
tools right whereas IT and is we're

578
00:25:55,580 --> 00:26:02,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">being hired across the board not</font>

579
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:04,139
specifically in one industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's</font>

580
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:09,270
another kind of separation that I like

581
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:13,920
to put in there so so again coming back

582
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:17,400
then to what we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about cyber</font>

583
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:20,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">security so again I've been here 15</font>

584
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:22,269
years and I've taught a lot of the

585
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:23,708
security courses that we've had

586
00:26:22,269 --> 00:26:26,229
so really<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the time I started</font>

587
00:26:23,709 --> 00:26:28,179
teaching<font color="#E5E5E5"> security courses people said to</font>

588
00:26:26,229 --> 00:26:30,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">me well you guys need a whole track on</font>

589
00:26:28,179 --> 00:26:32,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">cybersecurity you guys should start a</font>

590
00:26:30,399 --> 00:26:34,208
track right rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> than just having a</font>

591
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,559
systems and networking track and a

592
00:26:34,209 --> 00:26:38,429
software development track you needed a

593
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:40,839
track in cyber and my answer was always

594
00:26:38,429 --> 00:26:42,820
well really students<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

595
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:45,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything we're teaching them first and</font>

596
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:47,139
cyber should be a master's degree

597
00:26:45,009 --> 00:26:49,450
because I thought well you know they

598
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:53,728
<font color="#E5E5E5">really need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be these ninjas out there</font>

599
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:53,729
they need to know all about computing

600
00:26:56,039 --> 00:27:01,629
they need to know all about computing

601
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:04,089
first and then we can teach them much

602
00:27:01,629 --> 00:27:06,488
more the ins and outs about<font color="#CCCCCC"> cyber</font>

603
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:08,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">security so I really kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of had that</font>

604
00:27:06,489 --> 00:27:10,959
refrain again and again kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of went</font>

605
00:27:08,859 --> 00:27:13,208
back my answer so you know at the time

606
00:27:10,959 --> 00:27:16,809
15 years ago hackers had to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

607
00:27:13,209 --> 00:27:18,909
skilled and<font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber security defense folks</font>

608
00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:20,769
in my mind had be really skilled as well

609
00:27:18,909 --> 00:27:22,659
well what's happened of course over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

610
00:27:20,769 --> 00:27:25,269
past five years as I talked with folks

611
00:27:22,659 --> 00:27:27,070
at you folks in industry saying hey we

612
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:29,979
need more graduates here right we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

613
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:32,499
people to fill these jobs and at the

614
00:27:29,979 --> 00:27:34,359
same time we've had a lot of tools come

615
00:27:32,499 --> 00:27:36,609
out for hackers we have a lot of tools

616
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:38,259
coming out for defense<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well and so</font>

617
00:27:36,609 --> 00:27:41,049
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys are starting to build</font>

618
00:27:38,259 --> 00:27:43,179
teams that need more than just the

619
00:27:41,049 --> 00:27:46,690
ninjas right so you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing a lot of</font>

620
00:27:43,179 --> 00:27:48,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">things from compliance to policy to</font>

621
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:51,549
working with you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> security awareness</font>

622
00:27:48,609 --> 00:27:53,499
so I look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bo here at UC and look at</font>

623
00:27:51,549 --> 00:27:55,359
his team ensure there's a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

624
00:27:53,499 --> 00:27:57,969
ninjas on there but<font color="#E5E5E5"> he doesn't need a</font>

625
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:59,589
whole team of ninjas right he<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs them</font>

626
00:27:57,969 --> 00:28:02,950
all to have some level of knowledge

627
00:27:59,589 --> 00:28:04,809
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> computing and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cybersecurity but he</font>

628
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:07,149
doesn't need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hire you know a whole</font>

629
00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:09,369
team of ninjas that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be really cost</font>

630
00:28:07,149 --> 00:28:11,379
prohibitive and he really doesn't need

631
00:28:09,369 --> 00:28:13,178
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I've come to come around and</font>

632
00:28:11,379 --> 00:28:15,908
obviously we've created a track in<font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber</font>

633
00:28:13,179 --> 00:28:18,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">security now to kind of some a dress</font>

634
00:28:15,909 --> 00:28:20,649
some of that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what can we give</font>

635
00:28:18,009 --> 00:28:22,659
students in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> four year program where</font>

636
00:28:20,649 --> 00:28:24,399
maybe they're not ninjas but they know

637
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:28,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">enough to contribute to your information</font>

638
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:33,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">security teams and this is and again</font>

639
00:28:28,539 --> 00:28:35,920
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I t about 15 years ago where we did</font>

640
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:37,990
it so other universities are real

641
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,520
the same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so other</font>

642
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:41,290
universities are talking with industries

643
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,480
like you guys and saying we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

644
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:44,980
people we need more people we<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked what</font>

645
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:47,200
do you need those people to do and the

646
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:49,870
first answer you give you describe the

647
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:52,180
ninja right and then I say well we can

648
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:53,500
produce a couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those a year and</font>

649
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:55,210
they were going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to cost you a couple</font>

650
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:57,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">hundred thousand dollars a year and then</font>

651
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:59,620
you say okay well maybe I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

652
00:28:57,430 --> 00:29:01,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">of those skills I need people to do this</font>

653
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:04,689
this and this and so we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of come</font>

654
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:07,149
around so nationally there's an effort

655
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:09,580
now but we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get in that minute so I've</font>

656
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:12,070
come come away from this whole Ninja

657
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:14,350
idea so everybody just happy a Rock's

658
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:16,899
all these guys presenting today<font color="#CCCCCC"> and my</font>

659
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:19,360
minor rock stars they're fantastic but

660
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:21,940
for you students out there you know at a

661
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,379
rock concert there's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> rock</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> star but</font>

662
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:25,300
there's a lot of support people there

663
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:27,700
right a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people pulling cables</font>

664
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:30,129
setting<font color="#E5E5E5"> up the stage doing all kinds of</font>

665
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:31,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">things so in cyber we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

666
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:34,870
everybody to be a rock star it's getting

667
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:37,840
that big so where does so we have this

668
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:39,879
ACM kind of graph so where does cyber

669
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:42,490
fit into this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is what we're</font>

670
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:45,160
think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> will gosh cyber really fits</font>

671
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:46,900
everywhere right there's not really an

672
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:49,150
easy place maybe we need a third

673
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:50,980
dimension here or something but really

674
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:53,440
you know their cyber and creating

675
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:55,180
devices so our defense contractors and

676
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">Dayton need to put Cyber in their</font>

677
00:29:55,180 --> 00:30:00,460
devices we need cyber and software

678
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:02,620
development obviously but we also need

679
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:05,170
folks who are you know setting up the

680
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:07,659
networks to understand cyber you know

681
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:09,880
who are doing the systems analysis to

682
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:12,190
understand cyber you know and I had my

683
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:14,020
industry split here well<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly</font>

684
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:17,590
there's a cyber industry you know

685
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:20,500
morphic here or<font color="#CCCCCC"> a fire</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I but certainly a</font>

686
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:23,260
lot of other folks in cyber aren't and a

687
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:26,190
cyber<font color="#E5E5E5"> disk specific industry they're</font>

688
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:29,050
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the more traditional kind of</font>

689
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:31,450
companies here okay so this is really

690
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:32,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">the question so where does cyber now fit</font>

691
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:36,250
into this you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> do we need to do</font>

692
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:37,720
is a university to create graduates that

693
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:39,700
are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> helpful for you all and</font>

694
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:41,470
as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys think about who you're</font>

695
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:44,530
hiring you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about well here's</font>

696
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:46,300
what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> T students do here's what CS</font>

697
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:49,520
students do what do I need for this

698
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:52,950
specific specific job

699
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:54,870
so before since since the university's

700
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:56,760
didn't really come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with you know what</font>

701
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:58,649
does a cyber person look like the

702
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:01,290
federal government needed lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

703
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:03,960
types of people so NSA started these

704
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:05,670
centers they've since connected with DHS

705
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:08,910
because a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like the</font>

706
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:10,890
NSA right so now it's the DHS NSA

707
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:13,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">Centers for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber for academic</font>

708
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:17,100
excellence<font color="#CCCCCC"> mku</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as a designated cyber</font>

709
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:19,500
defense so are we at UC so basically in

710
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:20,879
these we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to go and match up what</font>

711
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,920
you're doing your curriculum against

712
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:27,630
what they say<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cyber person should have</font>

713
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:31,140
so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> from DHS NSA they say for a</font>

714
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:34,140
cyber defense you need these are

715
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:37,380
designated based on their robust degree

716
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:39,900
programs and close alignment with

717
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:42,360
specific security related knowledge and

718
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:46,050
then there's the cyber operations which

719
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:48,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a deeply technical interdisciplinary</font>

720
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:50,879
higher ed program firmly grounded in the

721
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:52,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">computer science computer engineering</font>

722
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,140
and electrical<font color="#CCCCCC"> engineering disciplines</font>

723
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:58,470
and so again<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at UC our cyber</font>

724
00:31:55,140 --> 00:32:00,630
defense kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> is been driven by us in</font>

725
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:02,850
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> School of IT cyber operations been</font>

726
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:04,620
driven by computer science here at IT

727
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:06,990
all right you see but again we work

728
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:08,729
pretty well together on these

729
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:10,380
designations so again first the federal

730
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:14,280
government came around said well there's

731
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:16,290
no accreditation guidelines yet so we're

732
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:19,129
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> start doing this stuff well</font>

733
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:21,420
again a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a group of</font>

734
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:23,400
professors like me started saying well

735
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:25,650
gosh what should these programs look

736
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:28,560
like can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> create accreditation</font>

737
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:31,170
guidelines a lot of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was led by the</font>

738
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:32,790
military academies so faculty<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

739
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:34,410
we're starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to develop some of these</font>

740
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:36,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">things and so they created what they</font>

741
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:38,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">called the cyber education project and</font>

742
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,710
so there's a group of faculty getting

743
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,120
together over the past couple years one

744
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:44,400
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they did say well</font>

745
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:46,439
what's the landscape looked like one of

746
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:48,810
the cyber programs look like out there

747
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:52,320
so they created this word cloud based on

748
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:54,330
looking at cyber related programs around

749
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:57,450
the country and this is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they came</font>

750
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:59,850
up with information assurance used to be

751
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:01,500
almost all of them now though<font color="#CCCCCC"> cyber</font>

752
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:03,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">security is really the name that's</font>

753
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:05,200
popping up more and<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

754
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:07,719
or from these programs that are being

755
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:10,059
created but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again this group was really</font>

756
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:11,890
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in well what is what can we</font>

757
00:33:10,059 --> 00:33:14,530
create curriculum guidelines can

758
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:16,990
recreate accreditation guidelines so

759
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:18,820
that programs can go under<font color="#E5E5E5"> accreditation</font>

760
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:25,690
that's out from under the federal

761
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:27,668
government alright so this cyber

762
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:31,150
education project worked for a couple

763
00:33:27,669 --> 00:33:34,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">years and then like NIT they got set</font>

764
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:37,600
under<font color="#CCCCCC"> ACM now so ACM has a joint task</font>

765
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:39,820
force with<font color="#E5E5E5"> i triple e on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cyber security</font>

766
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,649
education they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to put out</font>

767
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:44,620
their curricular guidelines by the end

768
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:46,929
of 2017 so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to provide input</font>

769
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:48,070
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can through me or through their</font>

770
00:33:46,929 --> 00:33:50,799
website or going to some of the

771
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:52,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">conference's so the CIS se conference in</font>

772
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:55,840
Philadelphia next month<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be working</font>

773
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:58,960
but this is the the definition they've

774
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:01,149
come up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> for cybersecurity computing</font>

775
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:03,549
based discipline involving technology

776
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:06,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">people and information</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and processes to</font>

777
00:34:03,549 --> 00:34:08,710
enable assured operations it involves a

778
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:11,470
creation operation analysis and testing

779
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:13,210
of secure computer systems it's an

780
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:16,658
interdisciplinary course of study

781
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:19,090
including aspects of law policy human

782
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:22,090
factors ethics and risk management often

783
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:24,460
in the context of adverse adversaries

784
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:26,590
wow that's a lot we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> wise</font>

785
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:28,990
computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> science not doing this that's a</font>

786
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:32,260
lot of stuff to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put in there right so</font>

787
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:34,479
we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about some useful not even</font>

788
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:35,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">just within computing but now we're</font>

789
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,270
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about wow these students maybe</font>

790
00:34:35,859 --> 00:34:41,830
need to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> something about psychology</font>

791
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:43,869
about criminology about policy about

792
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:47,020
business so we're really talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

793
00:34:43,869 --> 00:34:50,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of skills here that these are these</font>

794
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:53,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">cybersecurity graduates need to have so</font>

795
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,629
they're basing their work<font color="#CCCCCC"> on these draft</font>

796
00:34:53,469 --> 00:34:57,700
knowledge areas as they create this

797
00:34:55,629 --> 00:35:02,230
curriculum so these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the areas that</font>

798
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:04,240
they've identified under kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what</font>

799
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:05,950
we're looking at so I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just go</font>

800
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">through cyber defense they're talking</font>

801
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:12,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">about so these are setting up the</font>

802
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:15,430
networks to defend against adversary's

803
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,910
adversaries cyber operations so this is

804
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:18,980
more the intelligence

805
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:21,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">engineering some of the stuff I'm sure</font>

806
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:23,299
Coleman<font color="#E5E5E5"> will get into forensics we all</font>

807
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:26,270
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what that is cyber physical systems</font>

808
00:35:23,299 --> 00:35:28,490
this is a SCADA systems or all the

809
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:31,400
internet of things that we're talking

810
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:33,828
about secure software engineering so

811
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:35,900
secure coding obviously students need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

812
00:35:33,829 --> 00:35:37,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">know about ethics as they work through</font>

813
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:40,730
this stuff they do need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know about</font>

814
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:43,250
policy governance and law risk

815
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:45,289
management<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a big thing and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then these</font>

816
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:47,539
behavioral sciences<font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind of I'm</font>

817
00:35:45,289 --> 00:35:49,220
working my research in so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the</font>

818
00:35:47,539 --> 00:35:50,990
draft areas that they're starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

819
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:53,390
build this kind of model curriculum

820
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:58,549
around and again these are not set in

821
00:35:53,390 --> 00:36:00,859
stone these are very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much in draft okay</font>

822
00:35:58,549 --> 00:36:02,839
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> again what we're doing here is</font>

823
00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:05,270
building what is this graduate with

824
00:36:02,839 --> 00:36:08,058
cybersecurity degree look like what are

825
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:09,980
they going to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> out knowing right so</font>

826
00:36:08,059 --> 00:36:13,789
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> where we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with within</font>

827
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:15,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">academia on spelling this out and</font>

828
00:36:13,789 --> 00:36:19,400
figuring<font color="#CCCCCC"> out where does this cyber</font>

829
00:36:15,109 --> 00:36:20,660
graduate fit over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past couple years</font>

830
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,420
the other thing the federal government

831
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:24,710
has done that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty nice is what I</font>

832
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:27,049
say it's nice it's pretty funny it's

833
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:28,549
part of the nice framework so the

834
00:36:27,049 --> 00:36:31,279
national initiative for<font color="#E5E5E5"> cybersecurity</font>

835
00:36:28,549 --> 00:36:34,009
education which was started in the bush

836
00:36:31,279 --> 00:36:36,380
administration and now revamped with the

837
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:38,809
Obama administration so they categorize

838
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:42,260
kind of what are these cyber employees

839
00:36:38,809 --> 00:36:44,270
do and what kind of skills and aptitudes

840
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:46,789
do they need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do these types of work</font>

841
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:48,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">and they've separated out into well</font>

842
00:36:46,789 --> 00:36:50,720
these people they securely provision

843
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:54,140
things they operate<font color="#CCCCCC"> and maintain protect</font>

844
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:56,240
and defend analyze so these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the type</font>

845
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:59,319
of things that most of you guys do on an

846
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:01,669
everyday basis they've got a nice

847
00:36:59,319 --> 00:37:04,038
document they this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is their cyber</font>

848
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:06,559
security workforce framework this is

849
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:09,529
really a working document that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

850
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:12,710
download and look at say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we need</font>

851
00:37:09,529 --> 00:37:15,109
people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our company who are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing this</font>

852
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:17,150
analysis right what should<font color="#E5E5E5"> we title that</font>

853
00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:19,520
and you can go and see you know they've

854
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:21,170
got a number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different job titles in</font>

855
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,940
here so you can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this or if you're a</font>

856
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:24,710
student you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> say well here's the type</font>

857
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:26,660
of things I<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to do what types of</font>

858
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:28,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">jobs should I look at and the federal</font>

859
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:30,589
government really is using this for a

860
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:31,940
lot of their hires it's a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

861
00:37:30,589 --> 00:37:34,609
document i'm not going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go through it</font>

862
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:37,640
instead of going through it<font color="#E5E5E5"> i thought</font>

863
00:37:34,609 --> 00:37:39,558
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'd show you how to get it so if you're</font>

864
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:41,118
not familiar with let me google that

865
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:51,739
feat for you it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of my favorite</font>
