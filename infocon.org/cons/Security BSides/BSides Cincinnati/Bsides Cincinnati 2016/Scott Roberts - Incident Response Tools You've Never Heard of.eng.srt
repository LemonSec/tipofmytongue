incident response on<font color="#E5E5E5"> OS X in the program</font>

29
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:33,518
it mentions iOS and then I realized

30
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:37,389
that's way too much to talk about so

31
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:41,090
we're just going to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> OS X</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

and not very perceptive at the time so I

45

missed that um you should trust me

in the making of this presentation oh

but there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be plenty of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">some core OS X concepts you need because</font>

00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:26,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">it turns out it's not windows except</font>

67
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:29,710
when it is and it's not linux except

68
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:31,270
when it is we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about a</font>

69
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:33,549
bunch of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools some of which</font>

70
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:35,919
are built in some of which just do a lot

00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:37,390
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> general purpose things we're going to</font>

72
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about free security tools we're</font>

73
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:40,479
going to talk page security tools and

74
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:43,479
then we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about places</font>

75
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:45,310
you can go learn way more about<font color="#CCCCCC"> OS X</font>

76
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:46,960
incident response then I can put<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:51,780
this is a four and a half hour

78
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:55,419
presentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so getting started</font>

79
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:57,729
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is why bother we all know</font>

80
00:04:55,419 --> 00:05:02,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">macs are just secure right out of the</font>

81
00:04:57,729 --> 00:05:05,020
thing you have this button right um

82
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:09,490
turns out no there<font color="#CCCCCC"> there have been some</font>

83
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:11,130
problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> whose CIA doesn't like you</font>

84
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:14,350
you've got a whole other set of issues

85
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:17,200
or just you know even basic developer

86
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:20,350
forums but the fact is that as market

87
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:22,539
share for OS X has gone up so have

88
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:26,080
people attacking it there was the

89
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:27,580
presentation discussing sixteen percent

90
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,270
market shares essentially where the

91
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:34,719
break-even point is for a platform being

92
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:36,700
worth targeting I we're not quite to

93
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,560
sixteen percent with OS X but i think

94
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:41,229
it's become a<font color="#E5E5E5"> big enough target that</font>

95
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,940
there are both commodity and you know

96
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:45,060
persistent attack groups that are

97
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,810
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacking OS</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> X</font>

98
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,039
unfortunately the biggest group that

99
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:50,650
hasn't caught up to that has been

100
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:52,300
vendors because it turns out most

101
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:57,940
security tooling support

102
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:59,620
for OS X is a not great you know I

103
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:01,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember talking to one vendor and they</font>

104
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:04,030
said oh we support OS X and I said great

105
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:08,620
like what<font color="#E5E5E5"> can you do and they said what</font>

106
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:12,549
we support the HFS file system not the

107
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:14,190
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing so you know this this</font>

108
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:18,340
provides a problem with<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone like me</font>

109
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:20,949
and I do say on OS X and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it kind of</font>

110
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:23,679
means two things to me there's doing

111
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:26,860
incident response using OS X as your

112
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,800
response platform which I do and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

113
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:32,849
on OS X as<font color="#CCCCCC"> in you're responding to</font>

114
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:36,370
attacks against OS X based machines

115
00:06:32,849 --> 00:06:37,930
which I also do so we're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font>

116
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:40,900
of bounce back and forth between those

117
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:45,580
two ideas but most things should be

118
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:47,799
fairly transferable and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so to give you a</font>

119
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:49,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit of perspective to my exact</font>

120
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:53,699
problem set I need to tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you a little</font>

121
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:56,318
bit about github so we have three really

122
00:06:53,699 --> 00:07:00,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problems we have three</font>

123
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:02,469
challenges we had location challenge we

124
00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:04,509
had a platform challenge and we have an

125
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:09,490
attitude challenge in how we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

126
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:11,110
at github so um we have a 500-person

127
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:14,440
company and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is our distribution</font>

128
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:16,240
across the world as of last night I

129
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,099
don't know if there anybody who has a

130
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,050
smaller company with more geographic

131
00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:22,960
distribution<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd like to buy you a drink</font>

132
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:24,849
later but this provides a huge set of

133
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,229
issues I was used to doing instant

134
00:07:24,849 --> 00:07:28,330
response where we could walk<font color="#CCCCCC"> down the</font>

135
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:31,419
street to grab a machine that had a

136
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:33,609
problem and being able to do this at

137
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:35,500
this level of distribution without you

138
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:39,009
know spending a fortune on airline

139
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:41,800
tickets is tough so our challenge is the

140
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:43,690
fact that we couldn't be hands-on in a

141
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,330
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases when we want to do anything</font>

142
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:48,190
technical it has to be driven by the

143
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:49,840
user themselves we've got to either get

144
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:52,180
them to enter the command or run the

145
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,638
<font color="#E5E5E5">right thing or simply do what we need</font>

146
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:57,129
because we can't be there and often

147
00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:00,729
can't even get a technical person to do

148
00:07:57,129 --> 00:08:03,880
that themselves so there's our platform

149
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:05,610
at github we are I had a hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> percent</font>

150
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,990
and I realize I'm technically

151
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:11,490
a little off we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got about three</font>

152
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:12,840
people running linux on the desktop 2016

153
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:19,979
really is the year of linux on the

154
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:21,239
desktop right yeah that was no we

155
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:24,270
haven't we have a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> people doing other</font>

156
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:27,060
things before the most part everyone of

157
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:30,599
github 500 or so employees is running

158
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:34,279
OSX at the same time our platform in the

159
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:37,229
data center is<font color="#CCCCCC"> one hundred percent Linux</font>

160
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:39,179
what's just both in both cases means you

161
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:40,469
know limited<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools i was talking at</font>

162
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:43,078
lunch with some some fellows about the

163
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:44,700
fact that i miss active directory it

164
00:08:43,078 --> 00:08:46,800
turns out for doing instant response

165
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,269
active directory super nice you can do

166
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">all kinds of stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we just don't</font>

167
00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:54,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">have as an option and lastly we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have our</font>

168
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:55,859
attitude and and this is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a you</font>

169
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:58,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">know Silicon Valley startup be sort of</font>

170
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:01,529
approach but we care a lot about trust

171
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:04,219
openness and transparency I have to work

172
00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:07,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">with my users I can't dictate to them</font>

173
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:08,490
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a set of developers it</font>

174
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,720
turns out if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't if developers</font>

175
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:12,800
don't like<font color="#E5E5E5"> something you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

176
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:15,839
they'll build a tool to mess with you

177
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,250
and there's nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> like when the</font>

178
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:21,990
malware is written by the people you're

179
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:23,640
actively trying to protect so as a

180
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:25,019
result we give our users a lot of

181
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,490
freedom<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we have to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that</font>

182
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:30,300
anything we build is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to support</font>

183
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:32,730
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea so no draconian tactics we</font>

184
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:35,069
can't enforce things we can't you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

185
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:36,209
hammer you have to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

186
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:38,430
make the case and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get people to</font>

187
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:40,290
understand why it's important what it's

188
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:44,699
trying to do and that it's in their best

189
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:47,130
interest and being<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're github we</font>

190
00:09:44,699 --> 00:09:48,839
also really like open source stuff we

191
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:50,250
have commercial tools will pay for

192
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,190
commercial tools but for the most part

193
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:55,440
all things<font color="#CCCCCC"> being the same we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tend to go</font>

194
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:57,600
with open source and in a lot of cases

195
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,779
there aren't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> close source things</font>

196
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,269
that would do<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily what we need</font>

197
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:04,649
so that's kind of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> why so let's start</font>

198
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,699
with concepts and these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

199
00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:10,199
important things you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to run</font>

200
00:10:05,699 --> 00:10:13,410
across up who has OS<font color="#E5E5E5"> X personally like</font>

201
00:10:10,199 --> 00:10:16,800
at home<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I could raise my hands</font>

202
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:19,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">like for people so how about anybody who</font>

203
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:23,459
has OS X in their environment they they

204
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:24,720
work in<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay a few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more who feels</font>

205
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:29,490
confident they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> one hundred percent</font>

206
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:31,770
protecting those OSX systems I shouldn't

207
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:35,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">have that up okay we're all in the same</font>

208
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:36,630
boat this is great<font color="#CCCCCC"> so so core concepts</font>

209
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:39,450
and things you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run across on</font>

210
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:42,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">OSX first thing you're going to run</font>

211
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:46,320
across his next and NS a lot NS

212
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:49,010
everything NS stands for next step it

213
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:52,080
was the name of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the company that</font>

214
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:55,590
Steve Jobs ran after he left Apple

215
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:58,050
thrown out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple whatever what's</font>

216
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:59,220
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> next and basically when Apple</font>

217
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:03,390
realized they weren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be able</font>

218
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:05,550
to deliver on OS 9 they simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> bought</font>

219
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:07,560
the whole company<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they didn't even</font>

220
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:11,280
bother<font color="#E5E5E5"> to rename anything so that's why</font>

221
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:13,439
you'll see NS everywhere this was a

222
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:15,240
replacement for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> copeland project you</font>

223
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">can get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into some fun apple history here</font>

224
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:20,970
but the fact is that what is OS 10 was

225
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,380
never meant to be Mac it was meant<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

226
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:24,540
its own thing and that's why it does

227
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:28,290
things dramatically differently from all

228
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:31,560
the os's that came before it I sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

229
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:33,810
mentioned this the the challenge of OS X

230
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,880
is that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> UNIX except when it's</font>

231
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:38,729
windows and then a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times they're</font>

232
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:43,980
going to add OS 10 on top of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

233
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:46,650
the core it's a monolithic mana kernel

234
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:50,820
or this gets into<font color="#E5E5E5"> some computer science</font>

235
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:54,020
stuff I totally<font color="#E5E5E5"> forgot but it's a POSIX</font>

236
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:59,910
compliant bsd derived operating system

237
00:11:54,020 --> 00:12:01,290
sorry is it a microkernel yeah okay like

238
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:04,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">I said computer science stuff I forgot a</font>

239
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:05,910
long time ago they've added a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

240
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,710
window stuff on top<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make it</font>

241
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:09,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">more friendly in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> windows environments</font>

242
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:11,730
and then they added a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> OSX</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font>

243
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:15,000
because Steve Jobs thought they should

244
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:15,990
be there so the number one thing you're

245
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,920
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run into when you're doing</font>

246
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:22,110
incident response on OS X is<font color="#E5E5E5"> P lists p</font>

247
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:25,589
lists are everything p list is the data

248
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:27,450
store of choice on<font color="#CCCCCC"> OS X it's essentially</font>

249
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:32,579
the replacement for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows registry</font>

250
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:35,509
on OS X its doors configurations

251
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:38,219
it basically you just can store anything

252
00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:39,989
they refer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it as property let's</font>

253
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,999
organize data into named values and

254
00:12:39,989 --> 00:12:45,569
lists of values using several core

255
00:12:41,999 --> 00:12:49,459
foundation types see you at CF by the

256
00:12:45,569 --> 00:12:51,660
way is that s thing its core foundation

257
00:12:49,459 --> 00:12:53,488
these types give you the means<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

258
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:55,259
produce data that is meaningfully

259
00:12:53,489 --> 00:12:57,259
structured transportable storable

260
00:12:55,259 --> 00:13:00,629
accessible and efficient as possible

261
00:12:57,259 --> 00:13:03,209
that means nothing and they've really

262
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:05,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuck</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with that because p lists can be</font>

263
00:13:03,209 --> 00:13:07,559
almost anything they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can be flat text</font>

264
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:11,989
they're mostly binary they can also be

265
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:15,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">XML or JSON so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a fairly common</font>

266
00:13:11,989 --> 00:13:18,239
example of a plist they're all<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the</font>

267
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:19,829
place<font color="#E5E5E5"> and essentially if you're building</font>

268
00:13:18,239 --> 00:13:22,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">a tool that's going to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anything on</font>

269
00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:23,910
OSX the first thing it has to do is be

270
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:29,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">able to handle plist sufficiently and</font>

271
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:32,809
aggressively<font color="#CCCCCC"> majko is the binary</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> type</font>

272
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:36,749
that OS run OSX runs at its core is

273
00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:38,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">derived from next like most apple things</font>

274
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:42,360
it's way too flexible to make people

275
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:49,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">like us happy so it works on a 32-bit</font>

276
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:51,540
and 64-bit powerpc and intel mostly it's

277
00:13:49,619 --> 00:13:53,519
a little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of advanced version of</font>

278
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,779
what a PE file looks like it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> got some</font>

279
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,369
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> came along a little bit</font>

280
00:13:54,779 --> 00:14:00,239
later because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not as old of data</font>

281
00:13:56,369 --> 00:14:02,519
type as as portable executable so how do

282
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:04,769
you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> mako's you can get them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in so</font>

283
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:07,589
many ways they can come to you as

284
00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:09,480
packages which are essentially like

285
00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:12,029
miniature file systems that just map

286
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,829
directly onto your file system if you're

287
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:15,509
going to install anything that runs as

288
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:16,979
root or runs with administrative

289
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:20,399
privileges it's mostly<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to come to</font>

290
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:22,470
you as a package you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do dmg s or</font>

291
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,839
that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> generally just have apps in</font>

292
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:25,919
them so a dmg it's totally just a zip

293
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:28,279
file we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to call it</font>

294
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:31,889
something different because advertising

295
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:33,899
and then apps which are actually just

296
00:14:31,889 --> 00:14:36,119
file directories they just don't look

297
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:38,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">like it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you if you're on an OSX</font>

298
00:14:36,119 --> 00:14:41,309
machine you can click<font color="#E5E5E5"> on any app and go</font>

299
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:44,399
show package contents and you'll realize

300
00:14:41,309 --> 00:14:45,880
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a directory structure it just</font>

301
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,580
has an icon

302
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:50,740
you can get apps through the app store

303
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:55,060
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually isn't terribly important</font>

304
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:57,430
for for incident response so far<font color="#E5E5E5"> I might</font>

be jinxing myself apple's app store

00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:01,390
security measures have been relatively

307
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,990
good they haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a lot sneak</font>

00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:07,870
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's been horribly concerning</font>

also<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to need to about HFS or</font>

excuse me hfs+ which is the OS X file

unix transparent encryption / home

316
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:32,920

complicated as file systems go and one

319

thing I added<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought was really</font>

320
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:44,710
important is that you're come across a

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:53,410
is attach generic attributes to files

does anyone see where this could be

00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:12,430
useful for an incident response all

332
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:14,560
right you'll need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know about texts</font>

catch their kernel extensions this is

how<font color="#CCCCCC"> things run is root on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> OS X there's</font>

antivirus it can look for hashes and a

342
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:41,709
few other things but it's pretty minimal

343

largely effective so okay that was a lot

00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:51,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">of lists and a lot of different concepts</font>

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,660
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into one last one so</font>

347
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:55,270
anybody who does malware what's the one

348
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:58,990
thing I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about as far</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

349
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:59,600
like major OS level stuff I might have a

00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:04,669
sticker

351
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:07,010
you if you answer a SLR it does that

352
00:17:04,669 --> 00:17:10,160
it's not not terribly relevant<font color="#E5E5E5"> from an</font>

353
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:12,490
instant response perspective we haven't

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,990
talked about persistence mechanisms

355
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:17,959
where does<font color="#CCCCCC"> malware's a malware has to</font>

356
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:21,470
keep restarting and we get another

357
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:27,079
hipster picture I like this one it's

358
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:29,360
like a hobbit so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I kept</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font>

00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:35,929
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's windows this will be no more</font>

362
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:39,470
apparent than when you look at

363
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:41,659
persistence mechanisms so you can do

364
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:44,390
cron jobs you can literally just<font color="#E5E5E5"> write a</font>

00:17:41,659 --> 00:17:47,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">regular old unix cron job isn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

366
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:50,120
great texts can actually set themselves

367
00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:52,549
to run at startup so someone can install

368
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:54,850
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> kext on your system they get to just</font>

369
00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:57,500
run at startup whenever they like

370
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:59,870
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about four different places</font>

371
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,960
these can generally be per user account

372
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:04,879
so that gets a little complicated

373
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:08,590
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> launched Damon's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> launch Damon's</font>

374
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:12,890
is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> OSX effective way of doing</font>

375
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:14,809
persistent restarts across things lunch

376
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:16,280
d is the first process<font color="#E5E5E5"> it gets kicked</font>

377
00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:18,950
off and it's kind of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> big deal that</font>

378
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:22,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">runs anything it runs basically as</font>

379
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:24,350
system you can do startup items which

380
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:27,500
are user specific there they're not

381
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:30,320
privileged or anything but they kick off

382
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:33,140
by themselves this one's deprecated by

383
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:36,740
the way it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just still works there's a</font>

384
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:38,720
number of those we also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> login items</font>

385
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:41,059
they're different from startup items if

386
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,610
you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about that we need a</font>

387
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:46,870
few minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> but basically the same thing</font>

388
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:52,070
it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> more appropriate way these days</font>

389
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:53,989
we have login and logout hooks and oh by

390
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:55,580
the way OS<font color="#E5E5E5"> X is just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nice enough it will</font>

391
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:57,250
reload any applications that we're

392
00:18:55,580 --> 00:19:02,030
running<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you shut the Machine down</font>

393
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:04,220
so I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> through that's seven there are</font>

394
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:07,580
nine more does anybody need to go

395
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:09,980
through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest those the point is OS X</font>

396
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:12,710
is complicated it wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help you out</font>

397
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:13,370
by really allowing a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of different</font>

398
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">things</font>

399
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:16,820
and having a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different ways</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

400
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:18,290
doing the same thing and that becomes

401
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:22,040
really challenging for folks like us

402
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:24,260
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you might go through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the nine</font>

403
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:26,570
more common places where malware could

404
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:29,690
be persisting and it literally might be

405
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:31,730
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sixteenth one so being</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> prepared and</font>

406
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:33,170
automating things to cover all the

407
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:34,190
different eventualities and even just

408
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:38,740
being aware of all the different

409
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:43,040
eventualities is is a challenge<font color="#E5E5E5"> on OS X</font>

410
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:44,480
so the talk is about tools i'd like to

411
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:47,360
share<font color="#E5E5E5"> with you some tools that that i</font>

412
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,340
use in my day job that have helped<font color="#CCCCCC"> me I</font>

413
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,350
break these tools into a couple of

414
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:56,870
different things by the way tools and

415
00:19:51,350 --> 00:20:02,629
it's a hipster with a selfie stick oh so

416
00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:07,699
good um I didn't look<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> longboard</font>

417
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:09,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a good point opportunity so we</font>

418
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:11,740
think about these tools into a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple</font>

419
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:14,360
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> major sort of patterns</font>

420
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:17,090
alerting tools which are to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

421
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:18,520
compromise hosts triage tools which give

422
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:20,959
you some<font color="#CCCCCC"> extra information to determine</font>

423
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:24,139
is this a false positive or is it really

424
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,790
compromised forensics of how are we

425
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:28,880
going to understand you know what the

426
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:31,100
attacker did on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that system malware how</font>

427
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:34,520
we do construct attacker tools and then

428
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:36,678

432
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:48,290
bit about the colonel but the point is

433
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:49,490
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> Linux tools do work so if you're</font>

00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:52,129
used to doing this kind of stuff on

435

00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:57,410
go tues most of them are there they'll

437
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:59,960
mostly react the way you expect every so

438
00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:02,390
often it'll be the BSD variant which you

know mrs. one flag or has one extra one

440

but mostly the same a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what we end</font>

up using has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> VMs you know simply</font>

00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:14,960
both for process isolation as well as

443
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:18,170
being able to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> any tool you want you</font>

most common logs source you're going to

00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:47,830
get to is VAR log everything at OS<font color="#CCCCCC"> X is</font>

set to log into bar log if you only give

on a OSX machine first thing I'm doing

457
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:57,750
is just zipping grip VAR log and

458
00:21:54,100 --> 00:22:00,370
grabbing everything system writes their

applications are supposed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> write their</font>

00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:05,709
I believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> App Store applications are</font>

required to right there this is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

464
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:15,130
I wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to share everything that</font>

465

was going on with my<font color="#E5E5E5"> system with you</font>

468
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:26,140
really nice way of looking through

469
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:30,370
everything that's in varlug it does does

470
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:31,870
parsing does searching you know it's not

471
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:34,479
great as great as using something like

trust me it shows stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> Activity Monitor</font>

just don't we agree on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> pearls hate</font>

take pearl is a very is a very large

understanding a lot of time actually the

writing shell for instant response I

512
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:49,420
think she'll is also really

513
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:51,790
underappreciated it's an automation

00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:58,300
making it<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy I mean isn't that half of</font>

of the time is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just moving stuff through</font>

519
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:06,459
the same patterns on the command line so

520
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:08,350
those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> all built-in tools how about</font>

521
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:10,720
some non security tools that are still

522
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:13,360
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be useful well if you're on OSX</font>

525
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:21,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">really important they give you access to</font>

00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:22,420
a huge variety<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tools that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't</font>

528
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:29,170
compile or whatever it's just brew

529
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:30,280
install blah super nice two of the first

530
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:34,600
tools that I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about doing</font>

531
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:37,600
that with rj q and just q JQ bills

itself as grep for<font color="#CCCCCC"> json the very</font>

specific to<font color="#CCCCCC"> json and q actually lets</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:49,330
write sequel syntax against<font color="#E5E5E5"> csv files so</font>

535
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:52,629
being able to cat in a CSV file and then

536
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:55,060
do select star from is is really

537
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:58,030
powerful I end up using a Jake you in

538
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:59,919
particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> so here's a JSON blob of</font>

539
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:02,260
stuff that came off of a tool that I'm

00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:04,570
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about later I can't read</font>

541
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:07,090
that get much out of it but I run it

542
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:09,250
through JQ and now I get its nicely

543
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:10,889
parsed it's broken<font color="#E5E5E5"> up I can see what the</font>

544
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:13,150
actual I get some syntax highlighting

545
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:15,400
and then I can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> even go through</font>

546
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:17,110
and then right syntax against that to

547
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:20,830
simply just pull out<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lines that are</font>

548
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:23,709
important to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is a hugely</font>

549
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:24,850
powerful tool it's it's super fast so

550
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:30,430
even if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're dealing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with a huge</font>

00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:36,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually do need kind of the remote</font>

00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:46,360
a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> bucks but basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a a secure</font>

580
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:50,380
then grabs all of everything in VAR log

581
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:51,669
and gives you a sip file at the end of

582
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:54,600
everything you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> generally</font>

00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:58,090
diagnose what's going on with the system

system this was<font color="#E5E5E5"> our first move was just</font>

by default run OSX collector and

588
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:09,880
just have all of that there it's a

589
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:12,550
single Python file it has no

590
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,930
dependencies it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually something you</font>

00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:17,909
can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone to run with just a</font>

592
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:17,910
single shell script it's it's great

593
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:22,960
super basic there's actually not a lot

594
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:24,880
you can do with it they as far as

595
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,790
messing around with it it literally just

596
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:30,400
wants to do what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it wants to do they</font>

597
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:32,020
included a ton of filters that you can

598
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,180
go through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the results afterwards and</font>

599
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:35,860
it'll do things like grab every hash

600
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:38,020
that comes through in the results and

601
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:39,399
check them against virustotal and we're

602
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:41,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">only going to tell you about the hashes</font>

603
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:43,660
that match against virustotal so the

604
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:45,880
fact that there's not much here means

605
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:48,040
this system was clean as far as we can

606
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,780
tell they support doing your own

607

just keep running<font color="#E5E5E5"> Incident Response</font>

615
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:14,260
you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> step up we just moved to</font>

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:16,270
this tool it's called OS query that's my

00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">really cool thing OS query exposes your</font>

light tables I initially didn't like

625
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:42,360
this but I've come around to it because

626
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:47,460
you can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like select name from</font>

look at any application in your

applications directory that's name ends

634
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:12,399
with XYZ and it's allowed us to do some

really targeted really specific searches

636
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:18,340
across our infrastructure and do so on a

637
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:19,529
continuous basis I said at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the beginning</font>

638
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:21,939
how we're big on

transparency openness and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

641
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:30,220
really allowed us to do that because we

00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:33,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">can share</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with them in a format that</font>

developers will understand here's what

00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:40,750
we're looking for on your system some

645
00:30:37,779 --> 00:30:44,139
some little examples of using their kind

00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:46,600
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> repple system so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm doing select</font>

name and type and path from startup

648
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:52,360
items and it just kicks back here are

649
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:56,289
the nine things that start as soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

650
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:58,120
start my system up I can also do name

651
00:30:56,289 --> 00:31:00,820
and size from kernel extensions where

652
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:03,039
names not like com<font color="#CCCCCC"> doppel since that's</font>

653
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:06,100
how Apple names all of their kernel

654
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:08,080
extensions and I see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's only</font>

655
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:11,590
to enable both of which are security

656
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:13,059
tools I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> about so so that's super</font>

657
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:15,610
powerful it's really easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get started</font>

658
00:31:13,059 --> 00:31:17,980
with there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of other cool tools</font>

00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:22,299
that have come out around<font color="#E5E5E5"> it one of</font>

Liam's co-workers released their remote

661
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:27,668
management tool github built one along

662
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:30,190
with Heroku called windmill getting it

663
00:31:27,669 --> 00:31:34,210
setup is a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of work but it's a super</font>

664
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:35,799
useful tool once it's there from a

665
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:41,230
forensics perspective as they<font color="#CCCCCC"> buy heard</font>

666
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:46,240
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ger ok anybody used ger it's awesome</font>

667
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:49,809
right yeah so ger is a host forensics

668
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:51,220
framework built by google it bears a lot

669
00:31:49,809 --> 00:31:53,769
of resemblance to one by<font color="#E5E5E5"> another company</font>

670
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:57,039
but that's you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> backyard ettes a</font>

671
00:31:53,769 --> 00:31:59,200
inside baseball it's cross-platform so

672
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:01,510
it runs on OS X it also runs on Windows

673
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">and Linux which is a super useful thing</font>

674
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:06,549
it does memory forensics it can do pull

675
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,909
in forensic artifacts<font color="#E5E5E5"> from other places</font>

676
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:12,340
it does super smart things like you can

677
00:32:09,909 --> 00:32:13,779
specify a file in a home directory and

678
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:15,639
it knows what the path to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that home</font>

679
00:32:13,779 --> 00:32:19,570
directory would be if it was windows or

680
00:32:15,639 --> 00:32:21,309
OSX or whatever variety of Linux your

681
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:23,860
installed on so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of stuff is</font>

682
00:32:21,309 --> 00:32:26,678
really really powerful it's also got a

683
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:28,418
really great API so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a tool that</font>

684
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:30,789
we use when we have an indication of

685
00:32:28,419 --> 00:32:33,290
host is compromised and we use<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to</font>

686
00:32:30,789 --> 00:32:35,240
just be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a live forensic</font>

687
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:36,740
response and because it was built<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

688
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,510
Google they built it with the idea that

689
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:41,180
it might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be useful in the same data</font>

center you're in or across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world so</font>

00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:48,560
I've sat in Columbus Ohio using a server

692
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:52,940
in DC to do forensic response on a

695
00:32:54,830 --> 00:33:01,610
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> we not excited about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's</font>

pretty it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> a nice little you I if</font>

697
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:05,209
you're doing memory analysis because

698
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:07,730
there are certain times where that is

699
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:11,000
the only thing you can do volatility<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

700
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:13,280
great even on<font color="#CCCCCC"> OSX this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a huge variety</font>

00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:23,629
lists and things you know a number of OS

00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:47,120
turns out it also runs fairly well on

of information it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really nice Scott</font>

00:33:54,350 --> 00:34:03,560
you know pretty graphs and things like

717
00:33:56,030 --> 00:34:04,790
that because managers fear you know you

00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:08,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't just do all this stuff and forget</font>

00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:17,960
the same thing multiple times fear is a

722
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:20,840
tool that was written by a cert societe

723
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:23,210
generale and it does some cool things

724
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:25,070
with nna extraction stuff like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

00:34:47,149 --> 00:34:50,659
make sure you know they're there and

737
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:52,039
they're what you're expecting so you can

738
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:54,589
look<font color="#CCCCCC"> for cron jobs you can look for</font>

740
00:34:54,589 --> 00:34:59,690
out and takes those hashes and submits

741
00:34:56,449 --> 00:35:01,009
them to virustotal just to make sure

742
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:03,740
you're accidentally not running

743
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:05,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">something malicious so super good tool</font>

744
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:10,879
just to have laying around if you're

745
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:14,900
paranoid and all those were open source

746
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:16,430
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is pretty pretty amazing there's</font>

747
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:20,720
some paid security tools that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also use</font>

00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:24,230
a lot of this by the way it didn't it's

751
00:35:28,779 --> 00:35:39,890
multi go I mean stood stupefyingly cool

752
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:41,660
indeed um it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just does everything we've</font>

753
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:44,210
used it as our main platform for doing a

754
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:45,859
lot of incident response by by building

755
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:49,010
custom transforms to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a variety of</font>

756
00:35:45,859 --> 00:35:51,558
things learn to write your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own</font>

757
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:54,200
transforms if there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one you know</font>

758
00:35:51,559 --> 00:35:55,549
people use use multi go and think yeah

759
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,169
it's kind of cool it does some neat

760
00:35:55,549 --> 00:35:59,180
stuff and then you learn to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

761
00:35:57,170 --> 00:36:05,660
own transforms and it just changes the

762
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:08,450
entire game so will this run<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

763
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:11,799
this is me running a set of transforms<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

764
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:16,939
have specifically for for github data

765
00:36:11,799 --> 00:36:20,450
and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go and get all the</font>

places I've logged in from and someone's

767
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:27,770
messaging me oh yeah ok there's my

768
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:29,990
public information from my github

769
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:32,210
account and so building that kind of

770
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:33,919
stuff in starts to make it super

771
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:35,930
powerful because you can just pivot

772
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:39,289
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> information quickly it runs</font>

a lot about malware<font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis the go-to</font>

query you have to run<font color="#CCCCCC"> it locally or can</font>

you run it across your environment the

only part that they share is the

841

run remotely but they don't provide a

one called I want to say it was called

852
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:40,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">glass door but I don't think that's</font>

853
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:44,640
correct something door Dustin me fix

854
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:47,640
released one as well and it's not hard

855
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:49,710
to build your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own but it definitely</font>

856
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:51,990
supports the idea of running at scale

857
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:54,540
we're running<font color="#CCCCCC"> it at scale it works</font>

858
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:57,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">really well getting it to that point is</font>

859
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:57,350
a lot of effort

860
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:11,020
so the results it actually gives back

861
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:12,759
don't come back<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sequel light they come</font>

862
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:15,009
back as they can come<font color="#E5E5E5"> back in a variety</font>

863
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:16,599
of formats<font color="#CCCCCC"> JSON being the most common</font>

864
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:20,020
which means<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's actually a</font>

865
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:21,970
configuration to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> straight into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> splunk</font>

866
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:23,440
or elf or any of those types of things

867
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:25,299
if it can if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have something that can</font>

868
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:28,540
ingest structured data you're going to

869
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:30,400
get structured data back from it so we

870
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:32,800
we get the logs back pipe them into our

871
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,830
syslog infrastructure and they get

872
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:38,020
picked right up by our logging platform

873
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:40,598
so it's super easy at that point<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

874
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:43,950
then you can do whatever makes the most

875
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:43,950
sense for your organization with those

876
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:59,260
anybody on the wings yeah so so the

877
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:02,170
question was if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you run it live do you</font>

878
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:08,470
need to baseline it you don't need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

879
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:09,910
you could I don't think you'd see a

880
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:12,669
performance difference and the other

881
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:13,750
thing I'll say is that if one one thing

882
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:18,250
I probably should have<font color="#E5E5E5"> put in there that</font>

883
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:20,740
is important is a OS X is deceptive

884
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:22,150
about its stability so if you take if

885
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:25,359
you take four different people<font color="#CCCCCC"> and get</font>

886
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:28,300
them all to hash a common fought thing

887
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:29,380
like LS if you have four people chances

888
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:33,609
are you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get four different</font>

889
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:36,010
hashes there's not as much determinism

890
00:42:33,609 --> 00:42:37,359
as you'd necessarily expect across you

891
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:41,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">know for a phone operating system like</font>

892
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:43,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">that so I would almost</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be afraid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

893
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:45,730
getting too reliant on a baseline just

894
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:48,640
just cuz deviation could be good<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

895
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:50,080
killer so you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a reason to me</font>

896
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">cuz one of things when we first we're</font>

897
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:55,598
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this is oh let's just hash</font>

898
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:58,780
everything in user bid turns out you get

899
00:42:55,599 --> 00:43:01,000
a ton of different things so and that's

900
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:03,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">just live deploys and you know</font>

901
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,240
continuous deployment sort of stuff on

902
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:08,200
Apple's end but it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> complicated so</font>

903
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:10,180
baselining would be interesting I

904
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:30,330
haven't really played with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

905
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:35,049
that was fair sorry Kurt all UNIX of

906
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:37,600
so-so<font color="#CCCCCC"> ger has a project or rounds it</font>

907
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:42,070
called forensic artifacts and the idea

908
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:44,290
of forensic artifacts is things like you

909
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:46,660
want to know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to reference a</font>

910
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:47,950
file or a home directory well the home

911
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:51,850
directory is going to be different in

912
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:55,770
different operating systems so in OS X

913
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:58,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's slash user slash user name in</font>

914
00:43:55,770 --> 00:44:02,890
certain Linux it's going to be slash

915
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:04,540
user slash home slash user name the the

916
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:07,660
thing that the forensic artifact tools

917
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:09,610
does that merges into gurr is the

918
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:12,430
ability to say I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look for any</font>

919
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:14,230
files named X in a home directory and it

920
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:16,690
will understand that based on the type

921
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:19,120
of system it's looking at it might<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

922
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:22,570
to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> a different home directory prefix</font>

923
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:24,250
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get there so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just meant to</font>

924
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:26,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of translate between different</font>

925
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:28,330
systems and that's an<font color="#CCCCCC"> open source</font>

926
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:29,890
project and I their coverage is pretty

927
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:32,940
good but I mean I'm sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's also</font>

928
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:32,940
opportunity to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font>

929
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:45,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">oh we were talking about this one at</font>

930
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:50,800
lunch and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the fleet management</font>

931
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:54,880
problem at OS<font color="#CCCCCC"> X is complicated people</font>

932
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:56,620
have used Casper I've not I mean I do

933
00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:00,040
security on it I don't end up doing that

934
00:44:56,620 --> 00:45:02,859
aspect as much most of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've ended</font>

935
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:04,840
up doing has been letting the OS deploy

936
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:06,400
as usual and then just simply having

937
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:08,190
scripts that comes through afterwards

938
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:11,290
and change it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I want it to be</font>

939
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:14,430
but unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a little bit out</font>

940
00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:14,430
of my out of my scope

941
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:29,970
yeah and the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google Mac team has</font>

942
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:34,890
shared a lot of the stuff that they've

943
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:36,509
built just live on github and I mean

944
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:39,029
that's where the santa thing comes from

945
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:41,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">gers out of that kind of thing as well</font>

946
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:44,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">so you can definitely find a lot of</font>

947
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:48,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">useful tools for max built by Google on</font>

948
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:50,100
github<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right well I'm around</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

949
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:52,790
rest today thank you so much really

950
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:52,790
appreciate it
