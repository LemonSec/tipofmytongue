hey everybody we get started here gonna

29
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:46,090
walk over cowboy poem to the stage we

30
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:48,760
instead of holding the knowledge in so I

31
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:50,140
would feel more comfortable I know that

32
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,049
other people are gonna deal with this as

33
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:55,450
well and I noticed that there's a large

34
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:57,010
mix of age ranges in the audience and

35
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:58,959
the interesting thing about this topic

36
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:03,100
is that it'll affect all of you at some

37
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:05,500
point so a little bit about myself my

38
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:08,079
entire career has mainly been focused on

39
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:10,360
defensive stuff I've let Incident

40
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,790
Response Teams have done digital

41
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,410
forensics and investigations have worked

42
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:16,570
with three-letter agencies on Incident

43
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:18,340
Response and I built cybersecurity

44
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:21,640
programs vulnerability management

45
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:23,380
programs now I have done some offensive

46
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:27,220
things but primarily I'm focused on

47
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:28,840
defense my current role is VP of

48
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,970
information security at SH data

49
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,860
technologies were based out of Knoxville

50
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:36,340
Tennessee which is where I drove up from

51
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:39,790
yesterday I'm also the founder of I

52
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:43,090
think my sixth startup company legacy

53
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:47,200
forensics and that company actually came

54
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:48,970
out of what I've been doing I have

55
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,549
multiple firsthand experiences with

56
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:54,670
digital forensics of the deceased my own

57
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:57,670
family members as well as folks who have

58
00:03:54,670 --> 00:04:00,220
contracted me to help uncover a little

59
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:02,890
bit more about their loved ones legacy

60
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:05,609
after they pass and again that's where

61
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:09,089
my idea of legacy forensics came out of

62
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:13,060
and if you want to contact me on twitter

63
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:15,090
i'm kyle buff not that not that creative

64
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,579
with the name there

65
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:18,750
so I always like to start a presentation

66
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:20,579
with an agenda

67
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,680
I think it's respectful of the audience

68
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:24,990
much like if you perceive mean

69
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,700
invitations at work they should have

70
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:28,500
agendas because as they don't have an

71
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:31,919
agenda that means that meeting organizer

72
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,600
doesn't respect you so I put an agenda

73
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,099
here because there may be things that

74
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,350
you were expecting out of this talk and

75
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,669
then when you read the agenda you might

76
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,020
think hey I'd rather go hang out at the

77
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:42,240
bar and I'm okay with that

78
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:46,260
so we're gonna talk about how to deal

79
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:49,200
with the sudden unexpected death both

80
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:51,979
personally as well as digitally what it

81
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:54,570
means to be the executor of an estate

82
00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:57,690
where to start when you have absolutely

83
00:04:54,570 --> 00:05:01,020
no idea where to start and you feel like

84
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:03,150
you're isolated how to discover the

85
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:07,169
digital assets of the deceased and then

86
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:08,700
finally how to prepare your own life for

87
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:13,500
your own death so that you make it

88
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:14,789
easier on those who follow you we can't

89
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:19,770
have this conversation without talking

90
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:21,560
about death so this is a story I like to

91
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:27,000
say it's a story of inspiration

92
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:30,600
addiction anger and depression so this

93
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,060
is my dad Dan I grew up about an hour

94
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:36,300
north here in a city called Springfield

95
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:40,470
my dad owned an automotive repair shop

96
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:42,479
there and in the early 90s he started

97
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:46,050
another company called Computer Services

98
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:48,419
- or cs2 and if you're familiar with IBM

99
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:50,450
os/2 I kind of feel like that's where he

100
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:53,370
got the inspiration to name that company

101
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:55,080
but if he had never started that company

102
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:56,940
I don't think I would ever gotten into

103
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:00,180
computers I probably would have been an

104
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:02,250
automotive mechanic in the early 90s I

105
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:04,639
remember playing doom over a

106
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:09,060
twenty-eight baud modem with my cousin's

107
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:10,500
you know across town my dad then started

108
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,450
another company and you can kind of see

109
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,010
this entrepreneurial spirit which I

110
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:15,450
mentioned I've had I've started six

111
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:17,789
companies I think that's kind of where I

112
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:21,270
get this from my dad started another

113
00:06:17,789 --> 00:06:22,560
company in Tennessee doing overhead

114
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:26,010
crane maintenance and repair which

115
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,229
brought me to Knoxville and then he

116
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,700
bought yet another automotive repair

117
00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:32,180
company

118
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:34,760
so you can kind of see a line of

119
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:37,400
entrepreneurship and you know prior to

120
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:39,409
starting legacy forensics myself and

121
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:42,200
Adrian sanabria started a company called

122
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:44,210
savage security and we were acquired by

123
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,050
a company called threat care but again I

124
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:49,159
think that's where I get my

125
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:52,330
entrepreneurial spirit now about five

126
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:54,290
years ago my dad had back surgery and

127
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:55,880
you know when you're working on

128
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:57,830
automobiles all of your life and you're

129
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,630
bending over the sides of cars to work

130
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:02,080
on the engine bays it takes a toll on

131
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:05,570
your back so my dad had back surgery

132
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:09,919
well he was prescribed opiates for the

133
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:12,040
pain and I believe that this is kind of

134
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:15,680
where the downward spiral started he got

135
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:19,340
addicted to opiates it took a toll on

136
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:21,890
all of our relationships my relationship

137
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:25,460
with him my mom's relationship with him

138
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:29,300
my sister's relationship with him and a

139
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:32,210
couple years later my you know I ceased

140
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:35,660
talking to him my dad or my mom filed

141
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:38,690
for divorce and you know after the

142
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:42,110
divorce was final I believe my dad went

143
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:43,880
into depression and when you're already

144
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:46,430
addicted to a substance and then you

145
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:51,620
become depressed you look for more ways

146
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:53,780
to numb that pain so he found other

147
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:55,160
prescription drugs and when the doctor

148
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,690
started stopped writing him

149
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:00,950
prescriptions he found other ways to get

150
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:03,890
those drugs a couple years ago I was at

151
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:06,289
home hanging out with my wife and I get

152
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:09,830
a call from my sister and she's bawling

153
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:14,510
she says Kyle dad's overdosed he's in

154
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:17,919
the hospital so what happened was my dad

155
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:20,380
took too many pills drank too much booze

156
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:23,300
his heart stopped he was actually

157
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:26,570
technically dead the person with him

158
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:28,970
called 9-1-1 and thankfully there was an

159
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:31,070
officer and the closest aide did CPR and

160
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:34,520
was able to keep his heart pumping blood

161
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:37,280
until the the ambulance got there so

162
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:39,000
this point I thought you know the whole

163
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,000
world is crashing down around me

164
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,590
I kind of went into emergency mode I

165
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,510
started trying to figure out you know

166
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:47,190
his bank accounts and all that stuff

167
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:48,510
tried to pay the bills why he was in the

168
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,920
hospital and he was in the hospital for

169
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:53,939
about a month maybe a little over a

170
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,620
month I mean I thought okay you know the

171
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:57,330
drugs are out of the system you're clean

172
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,800
now my sister and I sat down with him

173
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:00,840
and talked to him about it he said he

174
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,430
was going to get help and he actually

175
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:07,640
did get help and I found this through

176
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:12,140
some posthumous discovery I suppose but

177
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:18,270
eventually depression set in again and

178
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:21,170
October 17th or 30 October 13 2017 my

179
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:27,390
sister called me again and said Kyle

180
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:30,870
dad's dead he killed himself so at that

181
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:32,790
point what do you do you know I I kind

182
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:34,380
of want to say I saw it coming but you

183
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:39,030
never want to really see that coming

184
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:40,530
right so when anyone passes away the

185
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:42,949
first thing you really need to do is

186
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:45,720
stop and breathe and think and think

187
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:48,980
about take time to think about things

188
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:51,270
and there are some implications both

189
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:54,830
financial implications as well as

190
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:54,829
digital forensics implications

191
00:09:55,030 --> 00:10:02,100
only tell people who absolutely need to

192
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:05,230
know and there's a reason for this so

193
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:10,030
when you have a new state and that state

194
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:12,130
has debts creditors if you will you're

195
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:15,160
not obligated to reach out to those

196
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:18,310
creditors instead you file a notice to

197
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:20,319
creditors in the newspaper and what this

198
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:21,969
means is this this is the official way

199
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,190
the creditors know that hey they can

200
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:26,020
file claim against the estate so let's

201
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:29,410
say that you have an American Express

202
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:32,079
debt of $100,000 and you pass away and

203
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:34,390
you do what's legally required of you

204
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,940
you file a notice of creditors in the

205
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:39,010
newspaper well if the estate closes in

206
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:41,080
one year an American Express never files

207
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:42,280
a claim against the estate that's a

208
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:45,550
hundred thousand dollars the estate

209
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:46,870
doesn't have to pay conversely if you go

210
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:49,120
out and start reaching out to all these

211
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:50,950
creditors and say hey so-and-so's passed

212
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,650
away you can guarantee they're going to

213
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:56,160
file a claim against the estate the

214
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:59,490
other reason is for your digital assets

215
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:03,010
you know don't shut down your cell phone

216
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:05,320
don't reach out to Google or Facebook or

217
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:07,350
whomever and say so-and-so's passed away

218
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,940
because this is going to severely limit

219
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:11,920
what you can do from a digital forensics

220
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:15,670
perspective and we'll get into that a

221
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:19,150
little later so how do you deal with

222
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:22,150
tragedy what I found is that everyone

223
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:24,160
grieves differently for me it's open and

224
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:25,840
honest communication I mean that's why

225
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,969
I'm giving this presentation I think

226
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,370
part of it is going to educate and help

227
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:32,830
others but the other part is personal

228
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:35,410
it's for me to go through the grieving

229
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:36,850
process to address this thing this

230
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:39,310
horrible thing and address it head-on

231
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:41,200
and acknowledge it and say this is what

232
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:43,959
happened and this is how we're gonna get

233
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,760
through it there's obviously a period of

234
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:49,030
sorrow and mourning and this can last

235
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,589
the rest of your life

236
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:53,589
another thing that's helped me is

237
00:11:50,589 --> 00:11:55,570
occupying my mind occupying my time now

238
00:11:53,589 --> 00:12:00,190
being the executor of an estate I really

239
00:11:55,570 --> 00:12:01,870
have no choice but to occupy my time but

240
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:03,550
just staying busy and keeping your mind

241
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:05,770
active and that's not to say that you

242
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:06,069
should just shut this bad thing out of

243
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:08,890
your

244
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:14,560
mind but it certainly helps in the

245
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:16,530
grieving process a lot of people look

246
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,479
for reasons as to why things happened

247
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:22,900
some people believe that this is all

248
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:24,580
part of some master plan I personally

249
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:27,100
don't believe that but if that's what

250
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:29,830
helps you feel better then I'm not going

251
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,480
to judge you for that and then you hear

252
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:35,470
this quote a lot everything happens for

253
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:36,970
a reason before my dad passed away this

254
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:41,230
meant something completely different to

255
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:44,620
me before they I had the experience of

256
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:46,840
death of a loved one everything happens

257
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:49,240
for a reason meant to me that someone

258
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:51,820
believed that everything was it was just

259
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,440
all set out a predestined destiny like

260
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,950
for example you go and you interview for

261
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,020
a job

262
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:57,850
and you don't get the job and you say

263
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:00,550
well everything happens for a reason it

264
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:02,380
just wasn't meant to be well now

265
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:04,359
everything happens for a reason means to

266
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:06,220
me that everything that happens is a

267
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,080
consequence of the actions that had

268
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,670
happened before it leading up to that

269
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,930
time

270
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:13,680
now you may perceive it differently and

271
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:16,180
that's fine but that's how I perceive it

272
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:19,089
so another thing I found around open

273
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:20,920
communication is that everyone has

274
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:22,570
experienced loss of some sort when I

275
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:25,270
started opening it up to my friends

276
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:27,400
about what had happened I had found that

277
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:29,710
other people have struggled with either

278
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:35,319
addiction personally or addiction in

279
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:38,260
their family folks had experienced loved

280
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:40,030
ones who had committed suicide and

281
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:42,520
there's a saying that's misery loves

282
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:44,079
company and it's absolutely true and I

283
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,640
found it to be very comforting you know

284
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,830
this is not something we just open up

285
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:49,300
and talk about you know I don't say hey

286
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:52,360
nice to meet you my name is Kyle buff

287
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:54,459
and oh by the way did you know that my

288
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,680
dad died like that's that's not an

289
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:59,080
opener but when you start talking to

290
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,699
people and you realize that everyone's

291
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,620
has experienced some loss it's

292
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:04,060
comforting because you don't feel like

293
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:07,660
you're alone anymore and you feel like

294
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:11,199
you can confide in someone that has also

295
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:14,319
experienced that pain I also got a great

296
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:16,270
book recommendation by Katherine Holman

297
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,290
she goes by investigator chick on

298
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:19,880
Twitter as it

299
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:22,009
okay that you're not okay and it talks

300
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:24,860
about how we live in a society that

301
00:14:22,009 --> 00:14:26,240
feels like you only get a certain amount

302
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,829
of time to grieve and then you got to

303
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,839
get back on your horse and ride into the

304
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:31,670
sunset and get back in the groove of

305
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,560
things and a lot of times that's not

306
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,910
true you know this is something that's

307
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,359
going to affect me for the rest of my

308
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:40,610
life

309
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:42,440
I'll never be over it so to speak but I

310
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:44,720
recommend this if you have gone through

311
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:46,190
something like this or if you ever

312
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,509
unfortunately have to go through

313
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:52,069
something like this this is a good book

314
00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:53,810
to read so there are a lot of

315
00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:56,810
circumstances around that death where I

316
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:58,969
just needed more answers and because of

317
00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:01,219
my skill set I felt obligated to my

318
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:03,290
family to provide those answers because

319
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:06,170
I knew that I could get them if I put in

320
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:08,480
enough effort so let's talk a little bit

321
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:12,889
about the digital forensics of the

322
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:16,310
deceased for me there are really three

323
00:15:12,889 --> 00:15:18,709
focus points there are our mobile

324
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:22,729
devices which more and more we live off

325
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:26,029
of there are you know our workstations

326
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:27,860
or laptops and then what I found was

327
00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:32,020
really the most helpful where cloud

328
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:34,330
accounts so we'll start there

329
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:38,050
if you can get access to that person's

330
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:40,660
primary email account at that point you

331
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:43,930
have access to everything and the reason

332
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:45,480
for this is if you say hey I forgot my

333
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:47,589
password please send me a password reset

334
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,770
they're gonna send it to that primary

335
00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:53,170
email address and so therefore you can

336
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:54,760
just chain these things together and get

337
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:58,300
access to everything that that person

338
00:15:54,760 --> 00:16:01,839
had created the issue is discovering

339
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:03,250
what they had created so I recommend

340
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,020
searching through the inbox for a

341
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:07,330
keywords you know search for Facebook

342
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:10,410
search for Twitter search for account

343
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:13,000
search for investment things like that

344
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:14,250
how do we get access to this primary

345
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,560
email account

346
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:20,290
well of course password reset questions

347
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:22,029
I mean this is how well was it Sarah

348
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:23,980
Palin has didn't Sarah Palin get hacked

349
00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:26,500
because somebody guest's her password

350
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:28,029
reset questions I use the term hacked

351
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:31,029
lightly but that's what the mainstream

352
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:33,790
media used so we'll go with that but

353
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:36,070
this is how I got access to not only my

354
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:38,560
father's primary account but also when

355
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:40,390
I've been contracted to do this digital

356
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,430
investigation on the deceased this is

357
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:45,790
how I get in password reset questions

358
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:48,370
and this is easy because you're dealing

359
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:50,079
with a loss and everyone wants to know

360
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:53,020
more information about that loss so you

361
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:54,550
reach out to the family members for the

362
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:57,279
answers to these password reset

363
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:59,589
questions so for example I didn't know

364
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:01,360
what street my dad grew up on I didn't

365
00:16:59,589 --> 00:17:04,900
know what his first you know pet's name

366
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:07,349
was but his sister's knew and so I asked

367
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:09,670
them and then I got into his gmail

368
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:11,260
another thing you can do is just utilize

369
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:12,819
the cookies that are saved on the

370
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:16,000
laptops and workstations that you'll get

371
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:17,800
into you know most people stay logged in

372
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,650
as a matter of fact if you were to steal

373
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:22,209
my laptop and type in inbox google.com

374
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:23,949
you wouldn't have to authenticate

375
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:25,689
because I'm already logged in and I

376
00:17:23,949 --> 00:17:27,970
think I say you know remember me for 30

377
00:17:25,689 --> 00:17:30,300
days but you can utilize these cookies

378
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:33,070
to get access to these cloud accounts

379
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:34,389
and obviously mobile devices I mean if

380
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:37,659
you have access to somebody's mobile

381
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:40,900
device you have access to their accounts

382
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:42,670
but what about 2fa you know it's really

383
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,560
unlikely that the person who's passed

384
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:47,170
away has written down there to have a

385
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:49,090
backup codes as a matter of fact I don't

386
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:52,810
think I've written down my TFA backup

387
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:55,449
codes it probably should do that but

388
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:58,510
what I found was useful is to take the

389
00:17:55,450 --> 00:18:01,030
sim out of their phone and swap it in to

390
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:03,400
another phone a burner and for your

391
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:05,740
burner I recommend an iPhone and this

392
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:08,860
has to do with the way that we're gonna

393
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:10,780
break into iCloud accounts later but if

394
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:13,479
you swap that sim into a burner

395
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:15,670
well now you can just say hey I don't

396
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,740
have my push device send me an SMS text

397
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:21,310
and now you have that second factor

398
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:23,830
where you can log in laptops and

399
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:26,139
workstations I mean this is your basic

400
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:27,850
forensics you're gonna pull the disk

401
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:30,270
you're gonna do a DD image

402
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:32,530
you're gonna let autopsy go through it

403
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:35,590
if you're looking for deleted files

404
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:37,770
obviously autopsy is gonna find that for

405
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:41,800
you you can organize easily with autopsy

406
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:43,930
for me having a forensic Lee sound image

407
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:46,870
on my dad stuff wasn't that important so

408
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:48,610
I just went directly to the drive but if

409
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:50,679
you are doing this for someone else you

410
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:52,840
probably want to use a write blocker and

411
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:54,610
go through all the your standard

412
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,800
forensics processes so you're not you're

413
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:58,330
not tampering with the data you have you

414
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,139
know your original and then you have the

415
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:02,020
piece that you're actually doing

416
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:03,730
forensics on you can use single user

417
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:05,889
mode to get into a workstation if you

418
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:07,960
don't know the password obviously you

419
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:10,180
can use a boot disk you can reset the if

420
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:13,960
the windows box reset the admin password

421
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:15,730
go reset the users password now I'm not

422
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,520
talking about a domain joined machine

423
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:22,240
I'm talking about a personal workstation

424
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:24,490
a Mac OS you can either use the Apple ID

425
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,140
to recover the password or you can use

426
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:27,310
recovery mode and like I mentioned

427
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:30,130
earlier the way we're going to get that

428
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:32,710
Apple ID is by using the primary email

429
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:35,560
address this is the way that I got into

430
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:37,510
another gentleman's account he had

431
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:39,370
multiple Apple devices I didn't know the

432
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:41,470
Apple ID but I did have access to his

433
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:43,919
Gmail so I just said please reset my

434
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:47,050
password and we were off to the races

435
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:48,980
but what about if it's encrypted

436
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:52,210
you know there's obviously a large

437
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:54,200
debate between federal government and

438
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:56,300
technology providers on putting

439
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,710
backdoors and encryption and there's a

440
00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:01,550
reason why it's because it's different

441
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:02,810
you really can't track it well what I

442
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:08,360
found is that there's actually still

443
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:11,090
hope for encrypted devices so Apple if

444
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:14,209
you let them will store your file Walt

445
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:16,459
key in iCloud so again if you have

446
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:18,140
access to iCloud you can pull that file

447
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:20,720
vault key back down and you can decrypt

448
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:23,420
the drive Microsoft does the same thing

449
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,100
with Windows accounts so you know your

450
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:27,490
live accounts if you let them they'll

451
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:29,659
store the BitLocker key in the cloud

452
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:32,030
also if you're in a domain environment

453
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:34,970
and you're using BitLocker and you have

454
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:36,620
em BAM set up the recovery key actually

455
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:38,060
gets stored with the computer object so

456
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:40,219
if you have a domain admin you can pull

457
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:43,179
the recovery key off the computer object

458
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:45,620
and these are ways that you can get in

459
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:47,870
now you'll find some interesting things

460
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:50,510
on the workstation such as browser

461
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:51,679
history but if the user is using Chrome

462
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:53,540
there's actually some more interesting

463
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:56,380
stuff you'll get and we'll dive into

464
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:58,670
that a little bit later

465
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:01,130
the third piece we talked about our

466
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:03,620
mobile devices and the way that we get

467
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:05,900
into Android versus Apple devices is a

468
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:08,030
little different so Android has this

469
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:10,850
idea of smart lock and what smart lock

470
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:12,850
does is if you visit a place multiple

471
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:14,990
times such as your work or your home

472
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:16,699
eventually Android will pop up and say

473
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:18,830
hey I noticed that you visit this place

474
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:20,330
a lot do you want to just keep your

475
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:22,970
device unlocked while you're there for

476
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:25,790
convenience and if the user says yes

477
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:27,580
like at home for example then Android

478
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:30,230
will keep that device unlocked at home

479
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:31,820
so if you have this person's device and

480
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:34,190
you know where they live you may try

481
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:35,990
going to their house and seeing if the

482
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:38,010
device automatically unlocks

483
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:41,760
[Music]

484
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:44,950
another thing that smart lock works with

485
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,350
our Bluetooth devices so for example

486
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:48,640
smartwatches you can tell it hey if I

487
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:50,620
have my SmartWatch and it's connecting

488
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:54,400
my SmartWatch keep my device unlocked or

489
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:55,629
in-car audio so again these are methods

490
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,180
that you know you're kind of thinking

491
00:21:55,630 --> 00:22:00,130
outside the box but really it's

492
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:03,340
extremely difficult to get into a phone

493
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:05,440
that has a pin or a pattern or a

494
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:08,860
passphrase on it so you kind of have to

495
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,960
exhaust all of your options if it's a

496
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:13,959
Samsung device you can use Samsung find

497
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,220
my mobile to reset the pin on that

498
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,900
device

499
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:19,750
unfortunately Android device manager

500
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:21,430
does not allow you to reset a pin it

501
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:23,320
only allows you to set a pin and if

502
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:24,760
there's already a passcode or a pin set

503
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:27,310
you can't reset it the only thing you

504
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:29,800
can do is wipe it but Samsung's find my

505
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:32,379
mobile will allow you to reset the pin

506
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,879
so like on Galaxy devices you can reset

507
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:36,430
the pin and again we're going to chain

508
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,840
accounts together to get access so we're

509
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:43,120
going to still rely on that primary

510
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:46,240
email address you can use the ADB bridge

511
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:48,219
to reset a password using a sequel query

512
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,380
but it's unlikely that if you get a

513
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:53,710
phone that's locked that they have USB

514
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:55,060
debugging turned on because your

515
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:58,000
standard user isn't going to turn that

516
00:22:55,060 --> 00:23:02,500
on and then there's the question around

517
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:05,800
biometrics so some of you may find this

518
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:08,010
morbid but I wish I would have thought

519
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:11,409
of this before

520
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:14,320
my dad was cremated because I've yet to

521
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:18,880
get into his phone his phone is a

522
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:21,760
pattern lock it's a Nexus 6p

523
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:24,400
I have a notebook of all the patterns

524
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:26,230
I've tried I've yet to get in and we're

525
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,810
talking eight months later I just kind

526
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:30,940
of gave up if I had thought about this

527
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:33,490
then potentially I would have access to

528
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:36,160
his phone now I already have access to

529
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:37,690
mostly everything I need access to but

530
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,400
it would be nice to be able to recover

531
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:40,940
the text messages that were on that

532
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,920
phone

533
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:44,720
but again I kind of just have to chalk

534
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:46,610
this up to I'm never going to see it I

535
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:50,180
have to accept reality and we'll just

536
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:52,010
move on when we're dealing with Apple

537
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:55,310
mobile devices please do not try to

538
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:57,410
brute-force these and the other cases I

539
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:59,840
worked where it was a woman whose

540
00:23:57,410 --> 00:24:07,310
husband had passed away and and some

541
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:09,620
suspicious circumstances the so the

542
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:11,570
local police took his cell phone

543
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:13,399
took his iPad because his iPad was in

544
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:15,409
his car and they continued to try to get

545
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,450
into it well what they essentially did

546
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:19,730
was brick his devices and once you try

547
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:22,640
so many times on an Apple device there's

548
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:27,410
no going back there is no time out it's

549
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:30,830
just sorry you're not getting in so the

550
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:32,540
way I got into this was not an iTunes

551
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:34,070
restore although that is one way you

552
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:36,770
could get in but unfortunately this

553
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:39,590
person never plugged in their phone or

554
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:41,690
their iPad to their iMac so what I was

555
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:43,939
able to do was an iCloud restore and

556
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:48,560
this took a little a little research and

557
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:50,960
a little finagling but I have a Mac Mini

558
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:53,330
at home that I use for just this I have

559
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:56,390
an iPhone 6 at home that I use for just

560
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:59,449
this I had to login to the Mac Mini as

561
00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:02,510
this person using this Apple ID then I

562
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:04,220
had to tell the iPhone that I was going

563
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:06,800
to do a restore from iCloud thankfully

564
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:08,690
he had an iCloud backup but Apple's

565
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:10,250
gonna ask you to do to FA an apples to

566
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:11,750
FA is a little different they're not

567
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:14,290
gonna send you a text we're gonna pop up

568
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:16,940
the to FA code on another Apple device

569
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:19,280
so that's why I had to login to the Mac

570
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:20,660
Mini so I could get that to f8 code so

571
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:23,389
that I could put it back into the phone

572
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:25,700
to restore from iCloud now what this

573
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:28,130
didn't get me was you know the text

574
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:29,420
messages that were on the phone any

575
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:32,090
notes that he had written on the phone

576
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:34,520
but what it does do is restore anything

577
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:38,810
that's in iCloud so pictures photos

578
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:41,120
things like that any email and this was

579
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:42,740
very helpful also again is the question

580
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,169
around biometrics I mean I think this is

581
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:47,240
something that we need to think about

582
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:49,040
it's not something that's pleasant to

583
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:51,500
think about but when we think about how

584
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:53,060
much we live on our phones and how

585
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,860
you know I would argue that mobile

586
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:57,050
devices are some of the most secure

587
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:58,520
devices out there today assuming that

588
00:25:57,050 --> 00:26:00,710
they're up to date and all of that you

589
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:02,060
know basic stuff when we think about

590
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:04,220
this we really have to exhaust all

591
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:08,570
options and biometrics is one option

592
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:10,250
that I feel like we need to exhaust so I

593
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:12,590
mentioned something about google history

594
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:14,270
and you know if you have so if you have

595
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:16,580
access to the workstation you can look

596
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:18,050
through the users browser history but

597
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:22,490
google history is not just search

598
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:24,980
history so if you if you use Chrome and

599
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:28,550
you log in with your Google account on

600
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:31,370
Chrome it syncs everything so your

601
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:34,760
browser history your bookmarks your

602
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:37,040
saved passwords I would recommend not

603
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:39,170
saving passwords in your browser but

604
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:42,350
it's gonna bring all of that down to

605
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:44,720
whatever computer you login to so again

606
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:46,520
if you have access to the primary Google

607
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,870
account then you have access to all of

608
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,670
this data and it's going to make your

609
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:54,469
forensics a lot easier because now you

610
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:56,990
can essentially be this person Google

611
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:58,760
keeps location history so every place

612
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:01,460
you've ever been so this was helpful to

613
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:04,879
me because I wanted to know what was

614
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:07,040
going on with my dad you know a month up

615
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,780
to this thing happening and I was able

616
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:11,980
to track every place that he had been

617
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:14,480
you know work home the grocery store

618
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:17,150
some places I had no idea what they were

619
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:20,060
but it was helpful to me to put context

620
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:23,330
around what was going on I even saw you

621
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:26,210
know the the time the timeline of the

622
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:28,250
day that he had passed away from where

623
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:31,550
the sheriff's deputies took the phone

624
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:35,480
from the house to the courthouse to lock

625
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:37,190
it up and then one other thing that

626
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:40,550
people don't consider is that Google

627
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:42,950
keeps voice history so anytime you do a

628
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:45,139
voice to text and say what you want to

629
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:46,670
say into your Google phone or Android

630
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:48,560
phone it's going to keep that in

631
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:50,570
Google's cloud unless you explicitly

632
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:53,770
turn it off and and how many you have

633
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:53,770
explicitly turned this off

634
00:27:53,840 --> 00:28:02,749
so like 1% of the room so this was

635
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:06,468
helpful to me because I actually got to

636
00:28:02,749 --> 00:28:12,200
hear the last words my dad ever spoke

637
00:28:06,469 --> 00:28:14,299
and that was both emotionally jarring

638
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:17,570
but also somehow comforting it's kind of

639
00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:20,450
weird but you can take this voice

640
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:22,609
history and if you don't have access to

641
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:25,159
text messages or things like that you

642
00:28:22,609 --> 00:28:26,330
can kind of build a timeline of off of

643
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:30,710
what they're saying into this voice

644
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:33,109
history so that kind of wraps up the

645
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:36,259
whole digital forensics piece of how to

646
00:28:33,109 --> 00:28:38,149
do forensics on the deceased and if you

647
00:28:36,259 --> 00:28:40,519
notice it's mostly about chaining things

648
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:45,228
together chain accounts together knowing

649
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:47,809
where to look now let's talk about when

650
00:28:45,229 --> 00:28:50,320
we die because everyone in this room is

651
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:50,320
going to die

652
00:28:53,680 --> 00:29:01,040
even Jeff besos and Sergey even yeah

653
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:04,040
even though they're trying to live

654
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:05,750
forever about taking with what does the

655
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:09,730
Sergey takes like a hundred vitamins a

656
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:09,730
day he's probably gonna die too

657
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:15,710
and really this is about easing the

658
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:19,010
burden for your loved ones if you can

659
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:20,990
tell everything that was left for me was

660
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:22,910
a mess and you don't want to leave that

661
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:26,560
for the folks who care about you because

662
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:28,760
you care about them I think I would hope

663
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:30,530
so I break this down the three pieces

664
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:33,170
you really need to organize your assets

665
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:34,480
and when I'm talking about assets fine

666
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:38,540
we're talking about financial assets

667
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:40,640
digital assets and physical assets and

668
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:43,399
you need to write this down like on

669
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,140
paper if you do it digitally or

670
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:47,320
electronically print it I know that's

671
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:49,730
like we're stepping back about a decade

672
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:51,500
because no one uses paper anymore but

673
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:52,820
it's important that you write this down

674
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:57,380
and and we'll get to why that's

675
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:59,780
important so financial assets let's

676
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:02,060
start with life insurance if you have

677
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:04,280
people that depend on you you should

678
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:06,290
probably have life insurance and there's

679
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:07,910
a differentiator between life insurance

680
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:09,500
that your work provides and life

681
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:11,960
insurance that you can buy in the open

682
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:15,140
marketplace so for example I just

683
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:16,970
recently started a new job now I have

684
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:19,790
life insurance outside of this job but

685
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:22,790
let's say I pass away on my way back to

686
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:25,250
Knoxville today if I only relied on that

687
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:26,950
life insurance from the new job I'm sure

688
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:29,270
I'm not within the thirty 90-day

689
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:31,520
probationary period and that would leave

690
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:34,129
my wife with nothing and that's not

691
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:39,110
something you want to do so I urge you

692
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:41,990
to 1 get life insurance to write down

693
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:45,290
what the payout is write down who to

694
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:47,930
contact how to file a claim etc same

695
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:50,629
with retirement assets so you have 401k

696
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:53,000
IRA Roth IRA write down what

697
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:56,250
institutions there with write down the

698
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:59,190
estimated values and who to contact

699
00:30:56,250 --> 00:31:01,049
and same with investor investment

700
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:04,740
brokerage accounts so if you just invest

701
00:31:01,049 --> 00:31:07,710
in stocks just for fun if you have some

702
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:09,600
mutual funds or you have some index

703
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:11,360
funds it doesn't matter what it is the

704
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:14,750
point is you need to write this down

705
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:18,090
estimated values and who to contact if

706
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:19,530
if you were to pass away and also make

707
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:22,889
sure your beneficiaries are up to date

708
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:25,500
as you go through life you know before I

709
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:28,980
was married my primary beneficiary was

710
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:33,210
my sister well now it's not it's my wife

711
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:35,340
sorry Stacy however she is the

712
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:37,860
contingent beneficiary so in the event

713
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:42,299
of a horrible tragedy Stacey will get

714
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:44,428
everything checking and savings account

715
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:46,860
now this seems like it's kind of a

716
00:31:44,429 --> 00:31:50,760
no-brainer but it's really important and

717
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:52,379
I'll tell you why so I had no idea where

718
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:54,960
my dad's checking and savings accounts

719
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:56,549
were so what I had to do was I had to

720
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,200
take his death certificate and the

721
00:31:56,549 --> 00:32:00,240
letters of testamentary from the court

722
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,460
saying that I was the executor to the

723
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,440
estate to every local bank in the

724
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:06,570
Knoxville area and say hey does this

725
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:08,010
person have an account here that's not

726
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:12,570
something you want to leave to someone

727
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:14,370
else you want to spell it out kind of a

728
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:16,530
French thing PayPal some people leave

729
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:18,360
money and PayPal if you do write this

730
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:20,639
down crypto

731
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:24,299
does anyone have investments in crypto I

732
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:27,900
do and I wrote down exactly where to get

733
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:30,179
it now you may have offline wallet you

734
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:32,730
may keep this in the cloud the point is

735
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:35,160
write down how much coin you have and

736
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:36,960
how to get access to it you know my

737
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:39,690
uncle was telling me that my dad had a

738
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:42,059
Bitcoin wallet I have yet to find this

739
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:46,020
Bitcoin wallet it could not even exist

740
00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:48,510
but it's important to document it and

741
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:49,830
then of obviously loans debts mortgages

742
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:51,260
you want to make a list of all the

743
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:53,309
things all the people you owe money to

744
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:55,940
that goes back to the whole you know

745
00:32:53,309 --> 00:32:55,940
notice to creditors

746
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:02,260
for the love of God write a will this is

747
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:05,290
so this has been so helpful for our

748
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:07,030
family to determine exactly what needs

749
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:09,190
to happen with the estate and the assets

750
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:11,200
you certainly don't want to just leave

751
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:13,870
this to chance especially if you have

752
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,610
children and multiple children there are

753
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:18,250
going to be differentiating views as to

754
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:20,530
what to do with this your assets so

755
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:24,670
write a will but be mindful of your

756
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:26,020
executor it is not an easy task and if

757
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:28,390
you choose the wrong one it could

758
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:30,910
probably lead to a lot of this no I'm

759
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:32,380
thankful that I haven't experienced this

760
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:35,950
kind of bickering but I've heard horror

761
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:37,810
stories of you know siblings fighting

762
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:40,060
over who gets what siblings actually

763
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:43,179
suing each other so please spell it all

764
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:48,790
out in your will here's an example this

765
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:52,810
is me so since October 13th of 2017 I've

766
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:56,680
spent about 570 hours on the estate I've

767
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:58,929
driven 6,000 320 miles that's driving

768
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:00,820
from New York City to Los Angeles back

769
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:03,820
to New York City and you could probably

770
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:06,129
make it about halfway back to LA and

771
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:09,040
I've had to spend money out of my own

772
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:10,950
pocket to settle debts until the estate

773
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:13,168
is settled

774
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:15,000
so I'd say that to illustrate that it's

775
00:34:13,168 --> 00:34:16,828
not an easy task and you don't actually

776
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,690
have to pick someone in your family to

777
00:34:16,829 --> 00:34:22,079
be the executor you can pick a probate

778
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:24,929
attorney to do it for you and you know I

779
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:27,149
would recommend that if you you know if

780
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:29,490
you don't if you have a complex estate I

781
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:31,259
recommend that you know my dad's estate

782
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:33,299
is a little complex because he owns that

783
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:36,389
business the automotive repair business

784
00:34:33,299 --> 00:34:39,599
so technically now myself my sister and

785
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:41,609
my brother own 33% of that business and

786
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,349
I have to as the executor I'm the only

787
00:34:41,609 --> 00:34:46,040
person that's authorized to sign checks

788
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:51,990
so every Friday I have to go do payroll

789
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:54,629
not cool for our digital assets password

790
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:57,450
safes make this easy if you're not using

791
00:34:54,629 --> 00:34:59,819
a password safe you should be I don't

792
00:34:57,450 --> 00:35:01,980
care what password safe to use what your

793
00:34:59,819 --> 00:35:05,819
argument is over a cloud-based versus

794
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:07,230
local it doesn't matter use one put all

795
00:35:05,819 --> 00:35:09,540
of your digital accounts into the

796
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:11,640
password safe and document your master

797
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:17,040
password because without that nobody's

798
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:18,839
getting in for mobile devices you want

799
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,970
to document your pins your patterns your

800
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:24,569
passphrases I mentioned earlier I still

801
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:26,879
haven't gotten into my dad's phone just

802
00:35:24,569 --> 00:35:28,470
alleviate that burden for your loved

803
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,220
ones document your pins patterns

804
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:31,919
passphrases

805
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:33,419
now on your your if you're using

806
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,599
something like LastPass for one password

807
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:38,339
you're probably using 2fa you want to

808
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:40,140
make sure you have your two fa backup

809
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:42,630
code so those people can get into your

810
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:45,000
safe because without that two FA it's

811
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:47,430
gonna be really hard to get in now I

812
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,430
kind of sacrifice security for

813
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:52,710
convenience shame on me I suppose but I

814
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:54,660
use a tool called authy and while authy

815
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:56,880
does is it keeps all of your two fa in

816
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:58,618
one application first you have to

817
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:01,109
authenticate to it and then you have to

818
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:03,420
decrypt the actual database with another

819
00:36:01,109 --> 00:36:07,410
password so this makes it really easy

820
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:09,690
for my next of kin to get into all of my

821
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:11,640
two fa codes but it also makes it really

822
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:13,020
easy when I upgrade phones so how many

823
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:15,930
of you have gone through the hell of

824
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:17,700
updating all of your to FA stuff yeah

825
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:20,368
exactly you have to generate the QR

826
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:23,250
codes every time and it's just a pain so

827
00:36:20,369 --> 00:36:25,710
I use authy to alleviate this pain

828
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:27,390
again assess your own risk if you're not

829
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:31,310
comfortable with it don't use it

830
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:31,310
same with cloud-based password managers

831
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:36,240
now some accounts actually allow for

832
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:38,540
digital continuity some people call this

833
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:41,368
a Deadman switch

834
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:44,040
so LastPass has the idea of an emergency

835
00:36:41,369 --> 00:36:46,290
contact which you can specify so if

836
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,640
there is no activity in your LastPass

837
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:49,830
account for a certain amount of time

838
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:53,069
it'll notify that person and allow them

839
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:56,340
to get into it Facebook has the idea of

840
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:58,290
an a memorial account I I don't know

841
00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:00,810
I've kind of find this tacky but if

842
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:02,550
that's your thing then do it and then

843
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:04,710
Google is inactive account managers so

844
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:06,240
kind of the same idea of LastPass it's a

845
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:07,800
Deadman switch if it doesn't see

846
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,990
activity on your Google account for a

847
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,460
certain amount of time then it's going

848
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:12,839
to notify that person that you set up

849
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:18,300
and give them access to your Google

850
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:19,920
account so we've covered financial we've

851
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:24,420
covered digital now let's talk about

852
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:25,440
physical assets again firearms jewelry

853
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:27,599
collectibles

854
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:30,450
where are they stored they might not be

855
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,859
at your house they might be in a storage

856
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:34,740
facility they might be at a friend's

857
00:37:31,859 --> 00:37:36,750
house but just document what they are

858
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:39,000
and the value and if they have serial

859
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:41,730
numbers document that as well this is a

860
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,859
good practice to get into anyway for the

861
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:46,020
purpose of homeowners insurance

862
00:37:43,859 --> 00:37:47,880
god forbid everything anything happens

863
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:50,099
to your house if you have a list of all

864
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:52,260
of your assets with serial numbers and

865
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:53,640
values you can claim that also if

866
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:55,580
someone breaks in your house and steal

867
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:58,319
something you already have that set up

868
00:37:55,580 --> 00:38:00,779
so what we've essentially built is a

869
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:03,480
death dossier of digital financial and

870
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:05,220
physical assets it's a mixture of paper

871
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:07,020
and digital media like I said you're

872
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:09,598
writing this down but you also have your

873
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:12,180
two FA stuff and your Deadman switches

874
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:13,859
so to speak you're gonna put all of this

875
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:15,899
in a sealed tamper-evident

876
00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:19,680
envelope and you want to store it

877
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:21,359
somewhere safe obviously now you could

878
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,700
put this in a safety deposit box and I

879
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:26,130
recommend that but I also recommend

880
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:29,460
putting it in a physical safe in your

881
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:30,900
house so two locations that way if your

882
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:32,700
house burns down you still have

883
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:34,140
everything you know in that safety

884
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:36,730
deposit box

885
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:38,560
and it doesn't matter if no one knows

886
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:40,660
where it is so please tell your loved

887
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:44,099
ones where it is what the purpose of it

888
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:47,109
is you may even consider it kind of

889
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:49,839
doing a tabletop exercise so to speak of

890
00:38:47,109 --> 00:38:52,810
your own death where hey you take over

891
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:54,369
the accounts for a month so if one of

892
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:56,380
you if you're in a relationship and one

893
00:38:54,369 --> 00:38:59,020
of you pays all the bills and the other

894
00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:02,589
one you know does the other things I

895
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:04,329
don't know swap roles and so that way if

896
00:39:02,589 --> 00:39:06,220
anything were to happen it's not well

897
00:39:04,329 --> 00:39:07,510
how the heck do I get into all this who

898
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:09,640
do I need to pay where's the money

899
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:12,099
coming out of they've done it before so

900
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:15,069
very similar to tabletop exercising and

901
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:16,900
security and the fact that when you have

902
00:39:15,069 --> 00:39:18,460
an incident you practiced it you know

903
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:24,069
how to execute your instant response

904
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:25,010
plan so that's all I've got are there

905
00:39:24,069 --> 00:39:27,920
any questions

906
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:30,950
[Music]

907
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:32,930
all right no questions must have

908
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:34,370
answered everything either that or we're

909
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:37,399
all just depressed now and thinking

910
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:37,700
about our own death well thanks for your

911
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,300
time

912
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,299
I appreciate it

913
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,450
[Applause]

914
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:53,009
you
