00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:44,810
like the biggest ones like Def Con and

70
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:47,450
black hat and just small little meetups

71

and stuff I mean Jack Daniel just did

72
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:52,490
such an amazing thing when he thought up

73
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:54,200
one day let's just make a smaller one

74
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:56,150
for people that haven't gotten accepted

75
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:58,450

into five years

77
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:06,169
congratulations besides Cincinnati I

78
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:09,040
couldn't be happier to be here so I have

79
00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:13,700
another question before I start this so

80
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:15,139
how many of you want to hear so I'm

81
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,659
going a couple different ways with this

82
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:20,050
I can do an hour on technical stuff like

83
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:22,340
that's simple I've done it in dry runs

84
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:25,580
before but how many of you like war

85
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:27,940
stories and like want to hear fail like

86
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,750
failure does the six success stories

87
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:31,400
alright

88
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:35,360
I actually hear people grumbling yeah

89
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:36,950
let's hear how you screwed up cool so

90
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,750
we're gonna do that for probably the

91
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:39,800
second half I'm gonna go half in half

92
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,600
for people who don't care about that

93
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,520
we're gonna do technical I'll talk about

94
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:47,060
threat hunting and and and what I've

95
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:51,680
done and what I think it takes to make

96
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:54,890
an effective threat hunting program and

97
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:58,190
then I'm going to tell you how I screwed

98
00:07:54,890 --> 00:08:01,010
up and where I was five years ago six

99
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:03,350
years ago doing this I sure as hell

100
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:05,599
wasn't ready for a keynote back then so

101
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:09,289
this is pretty crazy to be up here thank

102
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:11,210
you to Coleman Kane who I'm just such a

103
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:14,240
big fan of we worked together briefly a

104
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:15,888
GE and the whole b-sides crew for

105
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,810
approaching me to ask me to do this I've

106
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:19,940
never done a keynote before so I can't

107
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:21,950
think of a better event to do it to do

108
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:23,690
it with but let's jump into the

109
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:27,289
technical part of this so I want to use

110
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:29,180
up all of Coleman's time I do not speak

111
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:30,830
for my own employer but I speak for

112
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:33,169
everybody else's employer so if you have

113
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:35,619
opinions about you know like Norse I I

114
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:37,698
speak for them it's fine

115
00:08:35,619 --> 00:08:39,949
okay some of you remember Norse how

116
00:08:37,698 --> 00:08:42,978
could you forget them the reputation

117
00:08:39,948 --> 00:08:44,479
score is 90% it must be bad why don't

118
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:49,459
worry about it

119
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:52,759
they'll threaten to humor so Who am I

120
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:56,388
somebody who can't work a thing cool my

121
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:59,259
name is Danny Akatsuki and I do threat

122
00:08:56,389 --> 00:09:03,350
hunting stuff I've worked for companies

00:08:59,259 --> 00:09:06,829
like mandiant GE Capital Bank of America

124
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:07,759
and now I work in the clouds I don't

125
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:09,109
know if I'm actually allowed to say

126
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:10,910
where I work yet but I think you guys

127
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:13,089
are probably guests because it's a real

128
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:15,439
jungle out there

129
00:09:13,089 --> 00:09:16,910

00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:31,279
crew we do a podcast every Tuesday of me

134

136
00:09:34,819 --> 00:09:37,219
to contest a Def Con called at Improv

137
00:09:36,829 --> 00:09:39,290

141
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,629
one of those slide decks and doing it

142
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,129
here it's where we make a whole bunch of

143
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:51,559
random slide decks and make you guys

144
00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:53,689
present it without ever having seen them

145
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:55,850

168
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:58,240
what are we gonna talk about

169
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:00,520
so throughout throughout my time doing

170
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,950
threat hunting it's been about you know

171
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:05,079
the past six years or so I've had a

172
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:06,580
chance to do it with some really amazing

173
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,430
companies and I've had a chance to learn

174
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:11,530
a lot from a lot of different people

175
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:15,760
including you know the people over at GE

176
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:17,290
and Coleman and you maybe you know maybe

177
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,240
you're a CISO in the audience maybe

178
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:21,219
you're a manager in the audience

179
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,320
thinking all right all these vendors

180
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:24,580
told me I need thread hunting right this

181
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,730
is the new hotness this is what we have

182
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:30,700
to do what should I even be looking for

183
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:32,830
like how do you even start that what do

184
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:35,500
you need to do that what does it take

185
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:37,330
and and and what kind of people go into

186
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,530
it so I've narrowed it down to three

187
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:40,930
things that I think are the most

188
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:42,760
important ones people the people you

189
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:45,069
hire the processes that you let those

190
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:49,480
people build and of course the

191
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:52,030
technology behind it it's so a lot goes

192
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:54,730
into choosing this right this right mix

193
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:57,490
of skills we don't really screw around

194
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:58,810
with the whole tier 1 tier 2 levels

195
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:01,660
anymore at least I don't think that we

196
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:05,319
should everybody plays from your most

197
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:07,020
junior analyst all the way up if you

198
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,430
foster these skills within your team

199
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:10,720
you're gonna end up having a really

200
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:12,579
great fair hunting program but let's

201
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,160
let's kick it off with hands-down the

202
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:17,590
most important part of any threat

203
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:20,890
hunting program it is the people that

204
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:24,130
you hire right no amount of magic boxes

205
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:26,350
will save you no amount of compliance or

206
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:29,350
or check checkmarks are gonna save you

207
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:32,890
it is the people that you're going to

208
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:35,890
hire and and foster their training and

209
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:39,880
have your more senior people mentor the

210
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:41,740
more junior ones so a lot goes into that

211
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:44,500
right a lot goes into the different

212
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:45,450
skill sets of the people that you want

213
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,450
to hire

214
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:51,960
and we're gonna go over some of them but

215
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:54,630
the first one is just that analytical

216
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:58,050
mindset right that innate power of

217
00:12:54,630 --> 00:13:00,780
curiosity cannot be understated right

218
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:03,599
just the it's literally the huh

219
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:06,089
that looks weird because it's not always

220
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,920
sexy you're not always gonna find China

221
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:08,610
and Russia just gonna Yolo in your

222
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,500
environment

223
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:13,380
like oh cool there they are and now we

224
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:17,400
found the big sexy apt it's almost never

225
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:19,140
that almost a it's like it's never you

226
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:23,069
never just see these big red flags it's

227
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:23,730
it's it's thinking about what looks

228
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,920
weird

229
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:27,900
from what the normal is I mean and that

230
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,290
really boils it down it's finding ways

231
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:35,970
that evil does evil things in your

232
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:38,089
environment one of my mentors one of my

233
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:40,320
dearest friends in this industry

234
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:43,860
show of hands does anybody know who

235
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,150
Chris Sanders is oh that makes my heart

236
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,820
saying Chris was actually the keynote

237
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:49,170
here last year and he was gracious

238
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:51,780
enough to be like don't worry I softened

239
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:54,089
them up for you I was like Chris I don't

240
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:55,260
think they remember that like they

241
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:57,360
were gonna have higher standards

242
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:59,460
whatever he speaks man I just I'm such a

243
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,900
fan of his if you're if you're thinking

244
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:03,750
about threat hunting and building up a

245
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:05,730
program or if you are that analyst that

246
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,240
or aspires to be in that kind of

247
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,860
position

248
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,860
he's one of those guys that you really

249
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:12,870
have to follow one of those coolest

250
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:14,310
courses that I ended up taking and just

251
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:15,660
learned so much from it no matter how

252
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:17,369
many years you've been doing this I

253
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:21,120
think you learn a lot from it is Chris's

254
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:26,030
investigative theory class and the core

255
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:30,540
part of that is metacognition right

256
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:32,939
thinking about thinking and I think

257
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:34,980
that's just one of the biggest things

258
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:38,160
that we tend to skip over especially as

259
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:40,650
you become more experienced and that's

260
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,719
awesome you build that ego up and you

261
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:44,220
build that experience up and you can

262
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,290
look at things and be like yes this is a

263
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:48,960
false positive or this looks weird or

264
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:53,130
whatever but it's easy to get caught in

265
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:55,680
that trap of mistaken experience for

266
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:58,240
bias all right like oh I've seen this

267
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:03,550
before so it must be this thing

268
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:05,110
I tell you a fail stored real quick that

269
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:08,109
I did when I was just a little junior

270
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:09,850
sock monkey right for anybody who may be

271
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:11,920
super new I don't like to assume

272
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:14,040
experience for people when I say sock

273
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:19,000
monkey it's security operations center

274
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:22,569
monkey it's and I was you know just

275
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,029
level one it was third shift and I drove

276
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:26,649
you know I took a train and drove two

277
00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:28,270
hours I was exhausted work until 6

278
00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:30,520
o'clock in the morning so we would have

279
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:31,689
alerts come in from the sim that would

280
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,579
just it would show you the same thing

281
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:36,940
like a sample of the P cab and why the

282
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:40,450
alert went off and after y-you just get

283
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:44,130
to be on autopilot and the one alert

284
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:47,440
kept saying it showed the header from

285
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:50,770
from whatever file it was and it said as

286
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,390
the headers do four executables ms-dos

287
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:53,620
executable or and then it give you a

288
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:58,600
bunch of other information which you can

289
00:15:53,620 --> 00:16:02,050
glean a lot from but me being level zero

290
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:04,630
I used to close tickets and say oh this

291
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:07,689
is ms-dos this doesn't matter because

292
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:11,890
it's das right

293
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:13,690
Jesus that's like I I think about these

294
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:16,380
things that I used to do at that level

295
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:19,120
when nobody was explaining things to me

296
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:21,189
of just being God I'm sorry to those

297
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,780
companies that I did that to like it's

298
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:24,730
one of those you know how you only ever

299
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:26,199
see everybody else's highlights right

300
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:28,120
like you can be in bed at night and

301
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,980
thinking oh god that thing I did seven

302
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:33,250
years ago is now tearing me apart again

303
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:37,180
that's one of those things like not

304
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:38,920
awesome but we all have those we have a

305
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:41,680
lot of people in this industry who are

306
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:44,589
really great at what they do but they're

307
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:47,410
not super good at explaining the process

308
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:49,420
of connecting those dots when I first

309
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:52,180
started it was it I always heard the

310
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:54,550
phrase it doesn't matter how you got

311
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:57,819
there just that you all get to the same

312
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:59,410
location and at the time I was like oh

313
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,820
yeah that's cool all right like I don't

314
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:02,860
have to worry about being judged on my

315
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:04,090
technique or whatever and as long as we

316
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,740
all get to the same conclusion all right

317
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:08,530
let's sit down in front of keyboard

318
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:10,780
let's fonts I have no idea what the hell

319
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:12,609
to do now I don't know how to get to

320
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:14,139
that end point because nobody explains

321
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:16,270
that because people people who were

322
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:19,630
really good at it just think you'll

323
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:21,639
figure it out right so thinking about

324
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:24,010
thinking and then passing those things

325
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,570
down to your other analysts is super

326
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:28,470
crucial when you're talking about

327
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:28,470
people's skill sets

328
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:33,760
one of the other ones that I really

329
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:35,620
wanted to highlight is a knowledge of

330
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,790
the attacker lifecycle right there

331
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:40,840
you're gonna hear a lot of great talks

332
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:42,220
today and you and any other comments

333
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:45,310
it's one of the other great conferences

334
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:47,890
that you guys should really go to is the

335
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:49,960
the b-sides in Augusta Georgia that

336
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:56,320
really is becoming one of the premier

337
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:59,290
defensive defender themed cons and one

338
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,149
of the things that were really starting

339
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:03,159
to stress and I want to stress it here

340
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:05,020
is just because you're a defender

341
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:07,330
doesn't mean you shouldn't spend a whole

342
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:10,389
lot of time learning about attacker

343
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:13,919
lifecycle and methods I'll I got I hit a

344
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:18,490
wall I got to a certain point where I

345
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:20,800
can only I was only so good like oh I

346
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:23,410
know all the theater and all this theory

347
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,820
and all these configurations and in some

348
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:26,560
different ways but like what are they

349
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:29,200
actually doing like spend some time in

350
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:31,870
the red team's shoes so I've Illustrated

351
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,520
this a little bit for you guys and girls

352
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:35,110
I'm sorry if I use guys and girls

353
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:40,379
interchangeably I mean no offense I'm

354
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:42,699
just old and stupid as a poor sysadmin

355
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:44,380
who hates their job trying to figure out

356
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:48,000
how they can make money and they decide

357
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:50,410
I can make money doing bad things right

358
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,680
driving not such a fancy car and I

359
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:55,930
stress this because this is people

360
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:59,110
defending against other people not only

361
00:18:55,930 --> 00:19:01,660
knowing their TTP's and and their and

362
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:05,199
their tactics and and why understanding

363
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:08,020
why they are doing what they're doing

364
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:11,350
so he starts doing bad things and now

365
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:14,889
he's rolling in it right and it gets

366
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:17,169
addictive and so they do and they get

367
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:19,930
rich and they go and buy a fancy car

368
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:21,040
that ends up there the only person

369
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:22,870
Europe with that Ferrari

370
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:26,889
and they get busted for tax evasion and

371
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:28,689
then the loop begins again I could show

372
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:30,970
you a whole bunch of attacker kill

373
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:31,630
chains I could show you mitre I could

374
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,640
show you

375
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:36,520
Lockheed Martin I can show you all of

376
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:39,160
these things but I use Cortese to

377
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:43,060
demonstrate that you're defending

378
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:46,690
against other people and very well

379
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:49,990
financed people a lot of the time entire

380
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:53,110
nation states that literally run like

381
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:55,480
companies they have departments they'll

382
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:59,169
have a department for these guys are

383
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:01,650
really good at you know of webapp

384
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:03,850
injections these guys are really good at

385
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:06,640
malware and this is a department for

386
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:09,340
fishing so when you think about it like

387
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,660
that people against other people and

388
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:12,310
then start thinking about well what

389
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:13,870
would be their motivations how would

390
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:15,669
they screw up which is what we're

391
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:18,129
looking for we're looking for that

392
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:20,200
needle in a haystack except the haystack

393
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:21,880
is literally just a bunch of needles and

394
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,070
you're looking for a certain size and

395
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:26,230
that's exactly how much it hurts when

396
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:29,350
you're trying to do it I don't care how

397
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:32,290
much experience you have I can if you

398
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:34,179
have the analytical mindset if you have

399
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:37,210
the experience I can teach you the data

400
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:39,430
set right that the data is the least of

401
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:42,490
your problems to learn that takes that

402
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:44,020
takes almost no time at all but thinking

403
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:46,450
about thinking right getting your gears

404
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:50,139
turning about who you're actually trying

405
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:51,670
to defend against there are some other

406
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:55,680
you know there are some other analysts

407
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:55,680
tool sets that really come in in handy

408
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:02,980
log analysis right lot and and so I'm

409
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:04,900
speaking both to the people that are

410
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:06,610
gonna be doing the hiring and to those

411
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,290
that are aspiring to do this or saying

412
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:11,350
well like what should I be studying I

413
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:15,430
got a great fail story later about how I

414
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:20,139
learned what to study yeah log analysis

415
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:23,740
can can you correlate between that IDs

416
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:25,720
alert going to those proxy logs right go

417
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,250
and then finding like where exactly that

418
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,960
IP address went to because that stuff

419
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:31,150
disappears all the time what host was

420
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,120
that tied to and when can you timeline

421
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:36,220
this do you have those endpoint logs

422
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:38,469
right do you have syslog do you have

423
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:40,090
your EDR solutions can you pivot and

424
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:43,810
analyze between all these different log

425
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:46,840
sources and connect those dots Network

426
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:49,480
forensics actually being able to see

427
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:51,220
things like in proxy logs is this the

428
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,900
true source and destination because a

429
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:55,300
lot of times it's not and you're gonna

430
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:57,580
be chasing a rabbit hole only to find

431
00:21:55,300 --> 00:22:00,250
out oh that's just the proxy and I can't

432
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:02,679
see past that well there's a gap right

433
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:06,450
there's like there's no you know x4 word

434
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:09,720
for you can't tell where that started

435
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:12,400
host forensics this is the one thing

436
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:14,140
it's show of hands who's been frustrated

437
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,360
by doing a hunt or doing an

438
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:19,330
investigation only to be crippled by the

439
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:22,330
fact that you have no host logs right

440
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:24,490
yeah the nervous laughter out there

441
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:26,620
tells me that it's it's a problem that's

442
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:29,380
common right and we need to start fixing

443
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:31,270
that or those I've been in situations

444
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:33,040
where those host logs are the

445
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:35,379
gatekeepers don't want to give them to

446
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:38,139
you right you have these silos I'm

447
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:40,720
speaking to everybody who works in any

448
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:42,580
company who runs any department that has

449
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,460
to do with information security you

450
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:47,379
cannot silo yourselves you have to

451
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:49,180
communicate you can't just say hey

452
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:51,010
because you're not on my team I'm gonna

453
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:53,890
make you jump through 6,000 hoops to get

454
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:55,010
this information that doesn't do anybody

455
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:56,500
any good

456
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:59,620
[Music]

457
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:03,490
network architecture right I came from

458
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:04,000
the networking end of things I fell

459
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:06,669
asleep

460
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,580
many a night to the to the dulcet tones

461
00:23:06,669 --> 00:23:10,929
of an audible book about Cisco all thing

462
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,918
anybody's ever a Cisco book for more

463
00:23:10,929 --> 00:23:14,260
than five minutes wants to hang

464
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:18,220
themselves and if you haven't you're

465
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:20,679
lying it's like if you get a job at

466
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:24,250
Cisco you cannot be creative when you

467
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:26,049
write these books if you they can double

468
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:28,500
as like prozac to theirs make you really

469
00:23:26,049 --> 00:23:31,720
mellow out and not care about anything

470
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:34,059
now we're analysis is also super helpful

471
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:36,480
I don't say that for a hunting that you

472
00:23:34,059 --> 00:23:38,590
would need you know a super in-depth

473
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,380
knowledge of this if you have like one

474
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:44,020
super malware person on the team that

475
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:46,120
would be immensely helpful because they

476
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:48,549
know exactly what that execution looks

477
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:51,100
like when again another stupid fail

478
00:23:48,549 --> 00:23:53,710
story of I used to think like malware

479
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:55,510
was just magic and like it changed all

480
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:58,210
the time so why even bother chasing it

481
00:23:55,510 --> 00:24:00,220
right no this stuff is machine code it

482
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:02,440
does certain things so if you just have

483
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:05,140
a general knowledge and somebody on your

484
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:06,909
team that knows how to do that like once

485
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:08,380
you fight if you can find that sample

486
00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:09,820
and be able to sandbox that and detonate

487
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:12,390
and see what it's actually doing to the

488
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:14,918
system that's super super helpful

489
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:17,289
never underestimate individuals style

490
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:18,909
too I I talked a little bit about the

491
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:20,260
whole it doesn't matter how you got

492
00:24:18,909 --> 00:24:25,840
there just that you got to the whole

493
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:28,390
place but if you go too far that way you

494
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:30,250
start stifling your analysts right if

495
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:32,350
you say you have to do a then B then C

496
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:34,539
then D play books are great like will

497
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:38,049
cover play books in a little bit those

498
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:40,090
user stories I highly recommend with

499
00:24:38,049 --> 00:24:43,900
your gonna be writing like a use case or

500
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:46,120
a user story write it as a story like

501
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:48,789
write all that out if I'm looking for an

502
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:50,678
IP address why you know why is it doing

503
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:52,419
that if I'm looking for a domain what's

504
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:53,770
that gonna tell me how would I find out

505
00:24:52,419 --> 00:24:56,500
if that was bad right write that stuff

506
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:59,200
at stories so and that's up to your own

507
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:01,120
individual styles right but if you have

508
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,370
some tricks and tips share that with

509
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,209
your teams go write a talk give it to

510
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:06,789
somebody else

511
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:08,289
motivate other people to think a little

512
00:25:06,789 --> 00:25:11,010
bit as you do so they can appropriate

513
00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:11,010
that to their own stuff

514
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:16,750
context is king if you hat you get all

515
00:25:14,649 --> 00:25:20,258
this data you do all this research cool

516
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:23,470
I have petabytes of data what does that

517
00:25:20,259 --> 00:25:25,509
mean wrong we have it if I could all be

518
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:28,419
we're all data orders at one point or

519
00:25:25,509 --> 00:25:30,220
another but applying the context to it

520
00:25:28,419 --> 00:25:31,929
and being able to tell those stories

521
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:35,350
about what those things we're doing how

522
00:25:31,929 --> 00:25:36,970
they correlate to each other you have to

523
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:39,219
apply a context to each piece of data

524
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:41,230
should it be there does this make sense

525
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:43,539
would it make sense in my environment

526
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:44,799
right and that's knowing your

527
00:25:43,539 --> 00:25:46,000
environment is also another super

528
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:50,230
important point that we'll get to in

529
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:52,149
just a little bit and of course my

530
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:53,200
favorite so wait tell me I shouldn't put

531
00:25:52,149 --> 00:25:58,750
this in there but I still think it's

532
00:25:53,200 --> 00:26:02,259
important yeah common sense and it's not

533
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:03,580
meant to be derogatory so I don't know

534
00:26:02,259 --> 00:26:09,370
work for some people who is totally

535
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:11,949
derogatory on but you know if if you're

536
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:15,820
on the more junior level out there I I

537
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:18,039
worked on a team where one of the more

538
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:20,620
junior analysts had escalated something

539
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:22,210
to me and he was like I found a bunch of

540
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:24,459
stuff I said all right cool what did you

541
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:27,580
get he goes I saw all this traffic and

542
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:29,830
it's all going to to two websites

543
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:31,320
ending in dot are you and I was like

544
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:33,399
okay cool

545
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:35,500
what about it and he was like well we

546
00:26:33,399 --> 00:26:39,549
should block all of this and I was like

547
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:43,059
that's that's Google like just because

548
00:26:39,549 --> 00:26:46,360
you see a country code at the end does

549
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:48,789
not incident make right it's it's

550
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:51,309
jumping to these conclusions right

551
00:26:48,789 --> 00:26:56,200
taking time to breathe and to think and

552
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:58,120
to and to correct those and and he was

553
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:00,100
just the thing about that was this as he

554
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:01,539
kept going on about it like no it's

555
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:04,120
definitely going out of the country it's

556
00:27:01,539 --> 00:27:06,908
definitely bad like leading no context

557
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:08,320
to it I wish I was exaggerating turns

558
00:27:06,909 --> 00:27:09,940
out that the business did a lot of

559
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,189
people did a lot of business in Russia

560
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:14,620
they did a lot of business in China they

561
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:15,809
had a lot of offices there if you see

562
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:18,209
something going to like you know

563
00:27:15,809 --> 00:27:20,309
Guam aren't like Turks and Caicos okay

564
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:21,929
and you don't have clients there but

565
00:27:20,309 --> 00:27:24,570
that's knowing your business so the

566
00:27:21,929 --> 00:27:28,889
common sense slowing down and thinking

567
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:31,379
if this makes sense or not so we covered

568
00:27:28,889 --> 00:27:32,580
the people I think pretty well some of

569
00:27:31,379 --> 00:27:34,439
the different skill sets that you can

570
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:36,749
aspire to or that you want to foster in

571
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:39,749
your teams which leads to helping

572
00:27:36,749 --> 00:27:43,279
finding evil on your network or ways for

573
00:27:39,749 --> 00:27:45,539
evil do evil things so at its most basic

574
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:49,379
process if I if I were to break it down

575
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:51,149
to the most basic steps of the processes

576
00:27:49,379 --> 00:27:54,149
that your people are gonna help you

577
00:27:51,149 --> 00:27:56,549
create so you have to get the data you

578
00:27:54,149 --> 00:28:01,619
have to put it somewhere and you have to

579
00:27:56,549 --> 00:28:03,210
get someone to look at it also don't

580
00:28:01,619 --> 00:28:05,459
underestimate secure transport and

581
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:07,379
storage which is a lot of things that

582
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:09,889
people forget and they overlook those

583
00:28:07,379 --> 00:28:12,689
parts it's a case in point

584
00:28:09,889 --> 00:28:18,029
so tinium everybody familiar with tain

585
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:20,789
iam most people okay cool I see nods 10

586
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:22,379
M is a end point product that you can

587
00:28:20,789 --> 00:28:24,389
use to collect end point data right but

588
00:28:22,379 --> 00:28:26,849
it's not what's not well-known is that

589
00:28:24,389 --> 00:28:29,158
any creds in their scripts that you

590
00:28:26,849 --> 00:28:33,479
write those tanum scripts are sent in

591
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:35,759
clear text across the network it's a

592
00:28:33,479 --> 00:28:37,799
it's an example of just because we have

593
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:41,849
security products doesn't inherently

594
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:44,668
make them secure and those are stored in

595
00:28:41,849 --> 00:28:48,629
the jobs log folder on each device it

596
00:28:44,669 --> 00:28:50,429
runs on so ok now if somebody gets on

597
00:28:48,629 --> 00:28:52,139
that end point and sees you have tain

598
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:55,499
him and notice to look for that there

599
00:28:52,139 --> 00:28:57,718
are clear text creds in there so don't

600
00:28:55,499 --> 00:29:01,339
don't discount secure transport and

601
00:28:57,719 --> 00:29:01,339
storage or even how your things work

602
00:29:01,809 --> 00:29:07,100
so how do we even get the data that we

603
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:09,170
need right this is a huge job data is

604
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:11,980
not normally the problem you can get as

605
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:15,200
much of that as you want you would think

606
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:17,360
but how do we decide it data by itself

607
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,640
doesn't equal intelligence and if you

608
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,409
just say log all of the things that's

609
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:24,110
overkill I mean we've all heard of alert

610
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:26,600
fatigue right that's the same thing just

611
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:28,939
too much of that is not as never a good

612
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:31,490
thing I could've stopped that just one

613
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:35,360
look this one loop example the other

614
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:36,530
loop act observe orient and decide and

615
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,260
this also ties back to the whole

616
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:41,540
thinking about thinking observe orient

617
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:43,910
yourself to your surroundings get to

618
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:47,590
know your network find those gaps that's

619
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:47,590
where you're gonna find the most evil I

620
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:53,179
really like this one

621
00:29:50,929 --> 00:29:56,780
the closest thing we as defenders have

622
00:29:53,179 --> 00:29:58,160
to a hunting Bible is hands down applied

623
00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:00,950
network security monitoring by Chris

624
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:03,559
Sanders and Jason Smith I have I read it

625
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:04,400
when I first started and I reread it

626
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:06,020
every now and again

627
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:08,630
and I take little tidbits that I need

628
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:10,040
and it still kills and it's the closest

629
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:11,960
thing that we have to anything that's

630
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:13,370
gonna cover pretty much anything that

631
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:16,700
would get your gears turning about how

632
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:19,010
to be a better defender and this is

633
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:20,590
their applied collections framework very

634
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:24,500
much the same thing define the threats

635
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:26,870
quantifying your risk that is I used to

636
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:29,150
think is you know a baby analyst like

637
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:30,709
who cares about risk it's all bad no

638
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:33,380
understanding that part of the business

639
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:36,050
is super super important identify the

640
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:38,179
data that you actually need they said

641
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:40,850
locking all the things know what are

642
00:30:38,179 --> 00:30:42,740
your crown jewels what are the things

643
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:45,590
that matter the most of if somebody got

644
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:48,980
to them and gosh you're PII would

645
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:51,709
cripple your company or do a lot of

646
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:54,950
damage I think about those things and

647
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:57,679
that way you can you can start narrowing

648
00:30:54,950 --> 00:31:00,320
down this just immense amount of data

649
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:02,750
that we have devices information

650
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,100
intellectual property there's a bunch of

651
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:05,150
standards out there that can help you

652
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,179
through this right if you're in health

653
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:08,610
care

654
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:09,750
they have logging standards for HIPPA if

655
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:12,750
you're in finance they have locking

656
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:14,280
standards for socks you know a wasp

657
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:19,380
nests there are things to help you out

658
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:22,530
in this another loop we we love loops as

659
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:24,440
defenders which I kind of like because

660
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:27,800
it really drives the point home that

661
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:30,990
this process is iterative right it never

662
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:33,480
stops it should always be this kind of

663
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:35,220
closed loop where you just keep doing it

664
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,990
and doing it over again until you get it

665
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:39,750
right but here's the hint you'll never

666
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:43,560
get it right but the goal is to keep

667
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:45,720
trying form a hypothesis use your tools

668
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:47,520
look for new patterns and then apply

669
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:51,060
your analytics to it right and then do

670
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:53,490
it all over again so we like loops we

671
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:57,480
have a lot of loops

672
00:31:53,490 --> 00:32:00,029
so cool we have data awesome we have

673
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:02,700
things like post based logs and we have

674
00:32:00,029 --> 00:32:05,760
firewall and antivirus and network

675
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:09,929
infrastructure and then all the other

676
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:12,690
stuff right like this is a lot of stuff

677
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:15,659
and and you need I try to stay away from

678
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:17,820
like wall ootek slides except to prove a

679
00:32:15,659 --> 00:32:19,440
point when it's useful so if you're

680
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:22,500
gonna take little pictures of a slide

681
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,600
this might be the one to do because

682
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:27,750
being at the end of this fire hose is

683
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:32,189
for overwhelming and you have to always

684
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:33,690
be aware of that alert fatigue because

685
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:36,000
what alert fatigue does is it causes

686
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:39,690
your analysts and your hunt team members

687
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,690
to say I don't care anymore like here's

688
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:44,640
it whatever take this like close this

689
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:47,640
close this this must all be fall-like it

690
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:49,409
affects you psychologically like we we

691
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:51,840
all talk about alert fatigue and too

692
00:32:49,409 --> 00:32:53,880
many rules and too many alerts and and

693
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:56,850
all of these things as a matter of

694
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:58,380
course as a matter of process but always

695
00:32:56,850 --> 00:33:01,918
be thinking what it does to you

696
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:03,179
psychologically when when you when you

697
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,580
just when you have too many things

698
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:07,140
you're not finding anything who's really

699
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:09,090
gonna care about that after a while and

700
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:10,470
that affects your bottom line so

701
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:13,639
definitely something that really keep in

702
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:16,529
mind when everything is a high alert

703
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:18,270
nothing is a high alert right all of a

704
00:33:16,529 --> 00:33:19,830
sudden nothing seems to matter which is

705
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:23,279
why it's a hunt and it can never be

706
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:27,559
fully automated you absolutely need eyes

707
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:27,559
on glass hands on keyboard for this

708
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:32,158
now this was a better slide that doesn't

709
00:33:30,419 --> 00:33:34,649
make your eyes bleed

710
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:37,740
this will hopefully help you kind of

711
00:33:34,649 --> 00:33:39,870
categorize different areas of data that

712
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:41,789
you should really be thinking about and

713
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:44,010
I give credit to this is one of the

714
00:33:41,789 --> 00:33:46,740
slides that I did a presentation with

715
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:48,629
with Jackie Stokes find evil on Twitter

716
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:51,240
and Stephen Hank we all did something

717
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:54,720
that besides Agusta so i poached this

718
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:56,909
from our other one but bucket it right

719
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,279
if buckets help you do that security

720
00:33:56,909 --> 00:34:02,419
Network endpoint this is one that I

721
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:05,159
really wants you guys to focus on HR

722
00:34:02,419 --> 00:34:08,879
build a relationship with your legal and

723
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:10,950
HR teams cuz terminated users when we

724
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:12,389
talk about insider threats we're not

725
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:14,460
just talking about like somebody from

726
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:17,280
the outside that got in it's somebody

727
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:19,589
who's been there the whole time and is

728
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,990
now gone and then somebody forgot to

729
00:34:19,589 --> 00:34:23,639
disable their access there anybody

730
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:26,368
remember the story a bunch of years ago

731
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:28,230
about the sysadmin in the school

732
00:34:26,369 --> 00:34:30,540
district who got fired for something and

733
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:33,210
then just lockdown and encrypted

734
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:35,759
everything it cost them millions of

735
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:38,300
dollars to do that because nobody was

736
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:41,010
paying attention to the insider threat

737
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:45,830
that was now on the outside but still

738
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:48,720
had control employee work hours

739
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:50,520
acceptable use policies they're annoying

740
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:53,219
everybody just clicks okay yes except

741
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:55,530
but it's there for a reason

742
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:57,629
all right does that cover everything can

743
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:58,920
somebody slip out of culpability because

744
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:01,230
you didn't have a good acceptable use

745
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:03,480
policy these are all considerations that

746
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:05,460
you take into being being a threat

747
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,950
hunter

748
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:11,700
cool so we got the data what do we do

749
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:17,910
now we centralize it visualize and

750
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:19,020
search lies word I made it up but you

751
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:21,230
know you might be thinking about that

752
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,230
later

753
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:28,079
so for us no matter what budget you have

754
00:35:28,829 --> 00:35:36,790
it is always elk season elastic stack

755
00:35:33,099 --> 00:35:38,470
right the elk stack nothing quite fits

756
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:41,200
the bill for threat hunting

757
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:45,160
no matter the budget like elk that's

758
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:47,740
elasticsearch right log stash and Kabana

759
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:51,970
a way to get the logs in a way to search

760
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:53,009
them and a way to look at them one of my

761
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:55,839
favorites

762
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:57,760
like the great Phil Hagen Phil I love

763
00:35:55,839 --> 00:36:00,578
you so much if you watch this later I'm

764
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:03,160
just I'm still such a fan I'm talking to

765
00:36:00,579 --> 00:36:05,770
him like he's in the sky

766
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:11,890
Phil is awesome Phil Phil made a version

767
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:13,810
of Alex stack for Ford for those of us

768
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:16,839
that do forensics right so I would

769
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:20,828
definitely check that out one of my

770
00:36:16,839 --> 00:36:23,109
other favorite tools is it's called

771
00:36:20,829 --> 00:36:24,910
Scottie by Allen or Tokarski right it

772
00:36:23,109 --> 00:36:28,119
does collection processing and advanced

773
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:28,779
analysis so it shows you a lot of really

774
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:30,520
cool stuff

775
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:32,230
like it shows you the amount of syslog

776
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:34,420
this this covers like a whole

777
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:38,730
environment right this shows you like

778
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:41,560
the amount of syslog master file tables

779
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:46,300
this is the visualizations that you need

780
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:49,328
if you work in Splunk a lot learn how

781
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:51,460
the table like learn how to just take

782
00:36:49,329 --> 00:36:52,839
all that data and table without so you

783
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:55,839
can actually see what these things are

784
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:57,490
doing I learn tabeling far too late I

785
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,690
was like oh I should be able to tell

786
00:36:57,490 --> 00:37:01,118
what's going on from just seeing a bunch

787
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:04,839
of raw data in front of me Oh like learn

788
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:07,720
to visualize it helps it's awesome you

789
00:37:04,839 --> 00:37:10,569
can check this out at github github.com

790
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:14,259
slash Orlick asti Orlick Oski slash

791
00:37:10,569 --> 00:37:17,890
Scottie and this tool is gonna show you

792
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:19,540
is it works across Mac Windows and in

793
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:22,720
Linux he's got some great walkthroughs

794
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:25,079
up there so really really a crucial tool

795
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,078
have

796
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:38,560
so I want to be careful not to

797
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:42,339
understate how important context is it

798
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:45,940
is telling that story about what the

799
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:49,570
data is showing you right this one is

800
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:53,230
huge previous hunt and IR output because

801
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:56,890
you're not putting this stuff into that

802
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:59,230
feedback loop and informing your no no

803
00:37:56,890 --> 00:38:01,960
Intel you're ever gonna get is gonna be

804
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:05,440
more valuable than your own internal

805
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:06,790
Intel and you know a cert doesn't

806
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,260
necessarily mean they're also they I

807
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:11,140
could I've worked in companies where

808
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:13,270
they're the same but the assert doesn't

809
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:14,770
automatically mean IR and IR doesn't

810
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:16,630
automatically mean hunt those could be

811
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:18,910
siloed departments and if you have

812
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:20,950
something like that make sure that those

813
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:22,920
managers are all speaking to each other

814
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:26,259
and those teams know what they're doing

815
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:29,020
one of my last gigs you know we begged

816
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:30,340
for IR output because we know things are

817
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:32,560
happening it's not necessarily like a

818
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:33,790
huge breach or whatever but whatever the

819
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:36,250
incidents are like well what are you

820
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:38,230
seeing like how is that trending what

821
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:40,750
are those analytics right because that

822
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:42,280
will help inform us what we're gonna be

823
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:44,650
looking for so we're not wasting our

824
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:46,570
time and we couldn't get it or it would

825
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:48,280
take forever so we're just sitting there

826
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:49,690
twiddling our thumbs doing like the same

827
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,940
thing we've always done rather than

828
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:56,230
knowing what is actually threatening our

829
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:58,390
environment super important and then

830
00:38:56,230 --> 00:39:01,359
applying playa analytics like geo and

831
00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:03,850
feasibility why did Jack log in from

832
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:06,700
London and then two minutes later log in

833
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:09,040
from Kansas like okay that's probably

834
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:11,859
not great that's a that's a thread to

835
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:13,779
follow DNS entropy beacon detection

836
00:39:11,859 --> 00:39:15,729
right you can apply all those kinds of

837
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:21,039
analytics to those

838
00:39:15,729 --> 00:39:21,038
and we can cover threat Intel I guess

839
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:27,760
again the internally source intelligence

840
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:29,709
work with your red teams III set it in

841
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:32,710
the people section that is one of the

842
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:35,530
most and but like having debriefs

843
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:37,359
between your red and blue teams it's not

844
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:39,700
cheating we see what there's this

845
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:42,970
attitude it's slowly changing now but

846
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:45,160
there's this attitude of my fiefdom my

847
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:47,410
monkeys my circus right and I'm not

848
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:48,810
gonna show you my tricks because then we

849
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:50,980
can't that we're not gonna be as good

850
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:53,710
every time that you share these lessons

851
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:56,590
learn with other teams it makes both of

852
00:39:53,710 --> 00:40:03,070
you have to up your game it can do

853
00:39:56,590 --> 00:40:04,869
nothing but good baselines baselining

854
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:06,850
against it like you don't know what's

855
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:09,300
weird if you if you have no idea what's

856
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:09,299
normal

857
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:17,200
and then we have the externally paid

858
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:19,060
Intel I I have a bias against this cuz

859
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,529
I've never found really any that were

860
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:23,820
worth it but some of them are alright

861
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:26,020
like you can get uncertain email lists

862
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:28,180
and if you could find good Intel like

863
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:31,120
hold on to it right but never never

864
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:34,779
never underestimate the power of free

865
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:36,850
feeds your passive DNS the fed stuff can

866
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:38,140
be okay like the different ice-axe like

867
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:41,799
for those of you that are working

868
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:46,120
finance you have the FSI sack InfraGard

869
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:48,730
from from the FBI so this all helps

870
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:51,250
building that context we used to get

871
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:54,700
alerts from from a certain product we

872
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:57,360
were working on and they'd be like super

873
00:40:54,700 --> 00:41:00,279
high alert like ninety percent you know

874
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:02,050
certainty or whatever okay cool like

875
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,820
let's go ask intel and then it would

876
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:07,000
take forever to get an answer back only

877
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:09,340
to find that those i OCS were from an

878
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,160
incident five years ago but they're

879
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:16,920
still in the database informing current

880
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:20,020
decisions never under never never assume

881
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:21,760
where that were where that Intel came

882
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:23,620
from right like really dig into that

883
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,880
because you could I've spent days and

884
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:26,799
weeks looking at things want me to find

885
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:29,410
out oh this was from a domain that was

886
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:31,720
actually by now pwned six years ago but

887
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:33,580
now it's fine it's just you know it's we

888
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:36,180
just have it in there it doesn't do

889
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:36,180
anybody any good

890
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:46,009
I can tell you that what we need more

891
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:47,600
people invested in without I'm not

892
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:51,170
allowed to say a whole lot but is

893
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:53,500
learning cloud technologies right it's

894
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:56,780
it's applying the hunting methodologies

895
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:58,640
to the cloud because the same thing set

896
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:01,130
up that apply in your normal networks

897
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:03,710
your normal on-premises everyday

898
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:05,690
networks they still apply the cloud the

899
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:08,270
exception is you know being able to

900
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:10,130
monitor monitor and access your cloud

901
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:13,009
resources and permissions like there's a

902
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:14,750
lot to play with there and the more

903
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:18,020
research that I do into it to get better

904
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:20,510
at what I do the more I find we need

905
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:22,130
more of it it's not just like the next

906
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:24,650
big thing and yes it's just somebody

907
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:26,660
else's computer or a lot of stuff it's

908
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:29,990
not the next big thing it's already here

909
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:33,230
so I would definitely have a focus on

910
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:35,330
cloud technologies and and how that it

911
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:40,430
and how that affects your own company's

912
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:42,020
risk profile I love this I came from

913
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:47,680
squirrel everybody familiar with

914
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:51,110
squirrel cool squirrel is a was a a

915
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:52,879
threat hunting platform that did a

916
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:54,770
really great job and we still do a

917
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:57,560
really great job at showing the

918
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:59,840
relationships well you can do all of the

919
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:01,130
hunting that you want and and have all

920
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,870
of your indicators and have all these

921
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:04,850
things that a nice little bucket but

922
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:07,370
this actually shows you what's how these

923
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:08,540
things connect to each other right the

924
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:11,049
more that you can see these

925
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:14,509
relationships the more you can determine

926
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:16,160
how you can correlate those events and

927
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:18,580
are they really something that you have

928
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,580
to worry about

929
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:25,190
when we talk about rules in the learning

930
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:27,050
and then this so the question that I

931
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:29,180
hate the most is like defined threat

932
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:30,440
hunting I actually have a slacker room

933
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:31,819
where we have a little slack bot that

934
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:34,130
when anybody asked that it just tells

935
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:35,510
them the gtfo like that's how much I

936
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:37,340
hate the question because everybody has

937
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:38,930
a different definition of it so well

938
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:41,480
rules aren't hunting alerting is it no

939
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:46,190
but it's part of it it's part of that

940
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:47,390
automation you know things like things

941
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:48,740
like these rules that you put in place

942
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:51,830
and these herbs could be saved as a

943
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:54,890
query in a dashboard right that that's

944
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:58,640
that can show you how the lower and

945
00:43:54,890 --> 00:44:00,620
higher Fidelity's they're the hunters

946
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:02,509
that looking for that data can dig into

947
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:04,339
them and apply context to determine if

948
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:06,680
they're malicious or if they're just

949
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:08,270
like a Mis tuned alert so never

950
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:10,620
underestimate how important rules in

951
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:13,060
alerting actually are in hunting

952
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:14,650
[Music]

953
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:18,339
data retention is something you have to

954
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:20,589
look at to alright why why do we have to

955
00:44:18,339 --> 00:44:22,569
worry about how long would keep the data

956
00:44:20,589 --> 00:44:24,490
for well these are a few important

957
00:44:22,569 --> 00:44:26,050
points I want you to remember historical

958
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:29,500
purposes right you're never gonna catch

959
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:31,810
an intrusion in real time so being able

960
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:35,349
to go back through that and pick it

961
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:38,200
apart is extremely important operational

962
00:44:35,349 --> 00:44:41,440
noticing a sharp unplanned decrease in

963
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:42,669
log flow can signal a real problem but

964
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,619
you might not know maybe you haven't

965
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:46,390
checked that feed for a long time and

966
00:44:44,619 --> 00:44:48,970
now you have something come up like oh I

967
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:50,710
could really like use this in in this

968
00:44:48,970 --> 00:44:52,868
investigation and turns out that feed

969
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:56,920
dropped you know two days ago three days

970
00:44:52,869 --> 00:44:58,869
ago a week ago strategic in order to

971
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:02,170
apply your data to find your gaps in

972
00:44:58,869 --> 00:45:07,599
coverage it's the end game of this not

973
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:09,520
that there is one is to be able to to

974
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:11,740
fun it's not just finding the big bad

975
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:13,180
it's finding what you don't see it's

976
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:15,098
finding what you it's what you don't

977
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:16,419
even know you're missing so finding

978
00:45:15,099 --> 00:45:19,329
those gaps in your coverage and don't

979
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:22,569
forget legal legal is a huge part of

980
00:45:19,329 --> 00:45:25,119
these considerations if if prosecution

981
00:45:22,569 --> 00:45:27,160
is part of your organization's goal then

982
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:29,349
forensics data can be used in court to

983
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:31,290
assist that prosecution like something

984
00:45:29,349 --> 00:45:34,720
you really have to take into account

985
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:37,150
with how you retain your data if you

986
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:39,160
have a General Counsel work with them

987
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:41,920
you can leverage them to assist in like

988
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:43,930
crafting a policy for chain of custody I

989
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:46,180
mean these are things that even like us

990
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:47,919
as you know as just analysts we just

991
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:48,970
conserves those hands on keyboard don't

992
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,790
really think about but this is

993
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:53,049
everybody's responsibility in your hunt

994
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:56,609
team to think about these kinds of

995
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:56,609
things and be champions for these things

996
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:03,549
nothing is as awkward as saying hey we

997
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:06,609
hunted for something we didn't find it

998
00:46:03,549 --> 00:46:08,349
we're good because your executives are

999
00:46:06,609 --> 00:46:10,779
gonna look at you and say why are we

1000
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:13,180
paying you what we're paying you it's

1001
00:46:10,779 --> 00:46:15,700
not like this is not a measure it's a

1002
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:16,808
lot of times it's not a measurable but

1003
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:18,430
they think it's not a measurable

1004
00:46:16,809 --> 00:46:20,289
achievement saying oh no we're good

1005
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:22,240
it's the post-incident lessons learned

1006
00:46:20,289 --> 00:46:24,220
that can decrease your future instance

1007
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:27,578
nothing makes an executives butt pucker

1008
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:30,240
more then saying oh good news our

1009
00:46:27,579 --> 00:46:32,940
incidents went up this month excuse me

1010
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:35,618
why did I hire you why do I have on team

1011
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:37,809
the better you get things are gonna get

1012
00:46:35,619 --> 00:46:40,329
appear to be worse before they get

1013
00:46:37,809 --> 00:46:43,089
better the better that you get of this

1014
00:46:40,329 --> 00:46:46,450
stuff and then being able to communicate

1015
00:46:43,089 --> 00:46:49,150
to your executives and and and your

1016
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:51,730
other leadership is super important it's

1017
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:53,859
it's about discovering things that you

1018
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:57,730
either forgot we're never known in your

1019
00:46:53,859 --> 00:47:00,670
network this is that's a quality metric

1020
00:46:57,730 --> 00:47:03,910
of being able to say we found something

1021
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:07,210
like we found developer boxes that were

1022
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:09,670
spun up with network access that people

1023
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:11,769
just forgot about and they're still

1024
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:14,470
there chattering I can't tell you the

1025
00:47:11,769 --> 00:47:17,890
amount of times I could always go into a

1026
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:22,750
consulting gig and find IRC traffic like

1027
00:47:17,890 --> 00:47:25,299
IRC it's old know it's there and they

1028
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:29,410
don't know that it's happening right one

1029
00:47:25,299 --> 00:47:31,359
of one of my favorite stories is we were

1030
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:33,670
doing this gig this consulting gig and

1031
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:36,308
we were doing the out brief and we're

1032
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:38,769
giving our findings and we really hit

1033
00:47:36,309 --> 00:47:41,410
hard on the amount of outdated software

1034
00:47:38,769 --> 00:47:45,669
that they had multiple versions of PHP

1035
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:49,029
Java Firefox Chrome office all over the

1036
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:52,299
place and we gave all these two to the

1037
00:47:49,029 --> 00:47:54,910
executive and he slams his hand down and

1038
00:47:52,299 --> 00:47:58,200
says I have a business to run I can't be

1039
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:58,200
concerned about outdated software

1040
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:03,900
that's probably one of the biggest

1041
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:06,479
attack surfaces you will ever have

1042
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:10,439
it's not sexy by any means it's not a

1043
00:48:06,479 --> 00:48:13,468
smoking gun but attackers they live on

1044
00:48:10,439 --> 00:48:16,348
low-hanging fruit why work harder than

1045
00:48:13,469 --> 00:48:18,959
you have to to accomplish your objective

1046
00:48:16,349 --> 00:48:21,689
they're not burning zero days on you

1047
00:48:18,959 --> 00:48:23,939
when they can just do a cross-site

1048
00:48:21,689 --> 00:48:27,149
scripting attack against you and now

1049
00:48:23,939 --> 00:48:31,859
look now we're in like that's that is

1050
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:34,499
that shows that gap between their

1051
00:48:31,859 --> 00:48:38,058
understanding and of what the actual

1052
00:48:34,499 --> 00:48:38,058
real-life scenarios are like

1053
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:42,750
so we talked about the people and we

1054
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:45,000
talked about the processes that you

1055
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:48,360
build you can't do it without tools you

1056
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:50,220
need the technology magic boxes as I

1057
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:51,900
call them and it really depends on your

1058
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:53,790
budget one of the core takeaways I want

1059
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:56,280
anybody here to really to really think

1060
00:48:53,790 --> 00:48:59,610
about is you can do this stuff on a

1061
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:01,050
budget you don't need millions and

1062
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:03,560
millions of dollars for your security

1063
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:06,270
budget if you're a small to medium shop

1064
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:09,990
you can do things like elastic stack

1065
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:12,960
right somewhere to search somewhere to

1066
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:15,419
put it and somebody to look at it one of

1067
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:17,100
my favorites security onion if you have

1068
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:19,230
not played with security onion I don't

1069
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:20,400
know why you would not have I don't want

1070
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:21,960
to say I don't I don't want to assume

1071
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,980
that if you've never heard of it go play

1072
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:27,000
with it

1073
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:28,730
Doug Burks and his crew are one of the I

1074
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:32,240
would say they're one of the saviors of

1075
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:35,130
the defensive industry security onion is

1076
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:36,689
awesome but don't discount free and

1077
00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:40,590
open-source right

1078
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:44,360
Wireshark bro is another one bro is bro

1079
00:49:40,590 --> 00:49:46,620
is something you really need to learn a

1080
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:49,770
scripting language actually but you can

1081
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:51,690
build sensors on top of bro they can put

1082
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:53,340
out your your points of egress right and

1083
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:56,220
just see what's there see what's flowing

1084
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:58,970
like this can be done for really really

1085
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:58,970
on the cheap

1086
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:04,790
[Music]

1087
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:07,190
so where does all this bring us where

1088
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:09,080
does talking about the people that you

1089
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:11,270
have to find evil the processes I can

1090
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:14,450
find that evil and the technology that

1091
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:16,400
helps you find that evil what do i do

1092
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:19,730
how do I start what do we do now we have

1093
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:23,780
all this stuff right make no mistake you

1094
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:26,540
are all storytellers you have you tell

1095
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:28,100
stories every day whether it's about the

1096
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:31,310
things that happen to you things that

1097
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:33,970
are going to happen use those skills

1098
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:38,150
that there there are skills you have as

1099
00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:41,689
people apply them in your job you know

1100
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:44,210
the if you want to know what all the

1101
00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:47,060
findings that you have have in common if

1102
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:50,930
you're getting you know IP addresses and

1103
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:53,480
and and domains and file hashes and and

1104
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:55,759
and and Intel reports what do you do

1105
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:58,490
with that start writing a story I've

1106
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:00,470
been doing this for years and I just

1107
00:50:58,490 --> 00:51:03,470
started doing writing out long-form

1108
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:05,330
stories not just bullet points right

1109
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:07,609
it's like I had bullet point saying IP

1110
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:09,830
address and reputation of Alaba what

1111
00:51:07,610 --> 00:51:12,530
does that tell you what can you glean

1112
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:15,020
from that write a story right out in

1113
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:18,650
paragraph form

1114
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:20,690
it's super helpful to be able to to read

1115
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:22,160
it all out like that and then as you're

1116
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:24,860
writing it as you're reading it it

1117
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:26,899
starts those gears turning up and you

1118
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:29,600
think about everything else like that

1119
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:31,100
what is gonna be my ultimate goal with

1120
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:36,460
these things what is the reason I'm

1121
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:36,460
looking for this thinking about thinking

1122
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:43,440
so we come to the endgame we've covered

1123
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:48,180
a ton of data we found a place to put it

1124
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:52,750
there's no inkay it never stops

1125
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:54,700
it's noir you know nor should it it's

1126
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:56,770
it's the landscape is constantly

1127
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:59,859
evolving to exploit whatever the new

1128
00:51:56,770 --> 00:52:01,720
hotness is and there is always I always

1129
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:03,520
joke saying everything is broken it is

1130
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:05,560
whether we know it now or we're gonna

1131
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:10,290
know it in a month or five months or

1132
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:13,270
five years from now it never ends

1133
00:52:10,290 --> 00:52:15,029
so what are the goals reduce you're

1134
00:52:13,270 --> 00:52:20,080
never gonna be completely secure

1135
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:21,550
unless you're a marketer at a vendor oh

1136
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:25,779
then everything's secure we got

1137
00:52:21,550 --> 00:52:28,000
everything handled but you can aim to

1138
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:31,240
reduce your attack service to harden

1139
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,890
your environment and don't you know if

1140
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:35,290
you're not gonna do this the lessons

1141
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:37,480
learn the after-action reports if you've

1142
00:52:35,290 --> 00:52:39,820
never heard the AAR term if you're not

1143
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:41,830
going to do that just go home go find

1144
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:44,470
something else to do with life because

1145
00:52:41,830 --> 00:52:47,620
if you don't put this back in and you

1146
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:49,120
don't take that time and a lot that time

1147
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:51,279
at the end of an investigation or any

1148
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:53,920
hunts all right I did this today I

1149
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:55,420
didn't find this because and this is

1150
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,910
either a good thing or this is a bad

1151
00:52:55,420 --> 00:53:01,200
thing it's always a good thing you're

1152
00:52:57,910 --> 00:53:01,200
always gonna learn something

1153
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:10,740
so I got like 12 minutes left I think so

1154
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:14,280
now I'm gonna be a little more

1155
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:16,350
off-the-cuff you get the mic a little

1156
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:24,180
bit you have to get serious we're having

1157
00:53:16,350 --> 00:53:26,940
the mic so how many students do it do we

1158
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:29,129
have any students in the audience cool

1159
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:30,860
we have a few and you got you guys

1160
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:36,720
aspiring to be in the security industry

1161
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:40,740
like that's okay I feel like that too

1162
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:44,279
yeah some of the best keynotes that I've

1163
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:46,500
ever seen and write these down and go

1164
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:50,280
check them out John strands keynote at

1165
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:53,040
Derby con 7 is amazing it'll make you

1166
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:56,990
cry and that's nobody can possibly lift

1167
00:53:53,040 --> 00:54:01,650
up to that but my other favorite is

1168
00:53:56,990 --> 00:54:06,450
Jason streets one from Sky doll con 2015

1169
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:08,970
and I I like those because they weren't

1170
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:11,250
just about the technical aspect they set

1171
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:13,950
the tone for the entire con which

1172
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:15,240
there's only a one-day con but this this

1173
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:17,370
might be one of the most important ones

1174
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:18,990
you ever go to all right it's not

1175
00:54:17,370 --> 00:54:21,299
there's New York I see a bunch of if you

1176
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:23,399
know flashy lights like in Vegas you're

1177
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:26,970
gonna see a bunch of really good great

1178
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:29,250
quality content and you're gonna see it

1179
00:54:26,970 --> 00:54:31,230
hear it from a bunch of really quality

1180
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:34,590
speakers and that's just the most

1181
00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:36,330
awesome thing in the world I promised

1182
00:54:34,590 --> 00:54:37,770
you guys a really good fail story I

1183
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:39,420
don't know if it's really good I've told

1184
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:43,259
this before but it's never been recorded

1185
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:45,810
about how I got started doing this I've

1186
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:47,400
never done a keynote before there's the

1187
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:50,100
fact that they asked me was amazing

1188
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:53,910
but I asked you guys where you were five

1189
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:59,759
years ago today five years ago I was

1190
00:54:53,910 --> 00:55:04,350
just starting my career in security then

1191
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:06,960
it was at mandiant and I'm such a fan of

1192
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:08,400
Kevin Mandy a-- even to this day even if

1193
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,470

1194
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:13,609
work for the company but that dude

1195
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:16,218
always got it and I became a fan of him

1196
00:55:13,609 --> 00:55:17,808
and I was like I don't know what I'm

1197
00:55:16,219 --> 00:55:20,359
doing I came from a regular IT

1198
00:55:17,809 --> 00:55:22,009
background right I came from just fixing

1199
00:55:20,359 --> 00:55:24,469
printers and installing office and all

1200
00:55:22,009 --> 00:55:27,349
that kind of stuff but I want to work

1201
00:55:24,469 --> 00:55:29,390
for this guy like he gets it he's smart

1202
00:55:27,349 --> 00:55:31,130
I watched all I caught him in an

1203
00:55:29,390 --> 00:55:33,440
elevator one time and I was like oh my

1206
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:43,519
I've seen those to you and Travis two of

1207
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:46,489
the most brilliant minds in in the

1208
00:55:43,519 --> 00:55:49,098
industry so I wanted to work for them so

1209
00:55:46,489 --> 00:55:51,559
I started at zero and I applied I

1210
00:55:49,099 --> 00:55:54,349
straight-up applied I didn't know I knew

1211
00:55:51,559 --> 00:55:56,029
nothing I had no business doing it and I

1212
00:55:54,349 --> 00:55:59,660
got an interview for some one godly

1213
00:55:56,029 --> 00:56:02,390
reason I got an interview and I got

1214
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:05,660
through HR which I mean come on it's not

1215
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:08,538
that tough and then I got to the actual

1216
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:12,940
skills part my first interview with

1217
00:56:08,539 --> 00:56:15,410
mandiant lasted 13 minutes I timed it I

1218
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:18,469
was sitting in a parking garage I used

1219
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:20,749
to work at footlocker corporate and the

1220
00:56:18,469 --> 00:56:22,460
clock of the interview was at noon and

1221
00:56:20,749 --> 00:56:24,348
it was twelve thirteen by the time she

1222
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:26,839
kicked my monkey ass off the phone she

1223
00:56:24,349 --> 00:56:31,249
asked me a question about DNS and I was

1224
00:56:26,839 --> 00:56:34,430
like DNS is just this thing that does

1225
00:56:31,249 --> 00:56:38,390
things on the internet and names and IP

1226
00:56:34,430 --> 00:56:44,239
addresses I think maybe she's like okay

1227

1249
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:42,319
for her over the next six months she

1250
00:57:41,269 --> 00:57:45,109
would check in with me

1251
00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:47,329
and I just like I made a OneNote

1252
00:57:45,109 --> 00:57:50,750
notebook and I that was when you had to

1253
00:57:47,329 --> 00:57:52,190
be a generalist at everything and I said

1254
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:54,259

1255

1258
00:57:57,230 --> 00:58:02,960
weekend this woman had no absolutely no

1259
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:05,210
reason to believe in me it's kept

1260
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:06,710
pestering her until it worked and then

1261
00:58:05,210 --> 00:58:08,359
finally one day I remember I was out

1262
00:58:06,710 --> 00:58:10,759
shopping I like a farmers market or

1263
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:13,460
something and she called me Monica

1264
00:58:10,759 --> 00:58:14,839
California this is Jen and she was like

1265
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:16,730
so when are you gonna when are you gonna

1266
00:58:14,839 --> 00:58:20,660
sack up and come talk to me again an

1267
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:22,039
interview like huh exact words

1268
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:26,990
she'll dispute it but that's exactly

1269
00:58:22,039 --> 00:58:30,369
what she said and so I did they I went

1270
00:58:26,990 --> 00:58:33,828
down to DC and I sat in front of her and

1271
00:58:30,369 --> 00:58:36,019
Shannon battaglia at mandiant and I

1272
00:58:33,829 --> 00:58:39,500
think Devin Kerr I can't remember but it

1273
00:58:36,019 --> 00:58:42,558
was hosts and network and I slammed the

1274
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:44,960
network portion I felt so good I gosh

1275
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:48,309
this is amazing and then I got to the

1276
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:51,410
host portion and it was 13 minutes

1277
00:58:48,309 --> 00:58:53,240
before I was out the door I don't know

1278
00:58:51,410 --> 00:58:55,190
if it's 13 minutes but it felt like six

1279
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:56,899
hours

1280
00:58:55,190 --> 00:58:58,670
and I didn't get it I didn't get it

1281
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:00,979
again so that's okay I'm coming back

1282
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:02,210
again I'm doing this again I'll do

1283
00:59:00,979 --> 00:59:05,149

1285
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:11,569

1286
00:59:07,579 --> 00:59:14,239
cool we got time and so I studied I kept

1287
00:59:11,569 --> 00:59:17,299
moving and I kept networking right I

1288
00:59:14,239 --> 00:59:20,450
went to events just like this and not

1289
00:59:17,299 --> 00:59:22,160

1291
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:27,739
I'm super excited about and I learned

1292
00:59:24,829 --> 00:59:29,690
and I asked questions and then finally

1293
00:59:27,739 --> 00:59:32,509
on the third try Jen calls me I was

1294
00:59:29,690 --> 00:59:34,970
working a third shift sock gig and she

1295
00:59:32,509 --> 00:59:37,059

1296

but now you have to move to California I

1301
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:54,049
was like alright well I guess you know

1302
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:55,729
strike three but she's like go through

1303
00:59:54,049 --> 00:59:58,489
the interview anyway like we just want

1304
00:59:55,729 --> 01:00:00,578
to talk to you which is a lesson even

1305
00:59:58,489 --> 01:00:02,900
when you think you're about to bite it

1306
01:00:00,579 --> 01:00:06,259
keep going

1307
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:08,809
never underestimate your own knowledge

1308
01:00:06,259 --> 01:00:11,239
of things or just your sheer drive to do

1309
01:00:08,809 --> 01:00:13,789
it right at that point I thought I was

1310
01:00:11,239 --> 01:00:15,109
gonna be screwed again but I did it and

1311
01:00:13,789 --> 01:00:17,359
I interviewed just like I thought I was

1312
01:00:15,109 --> 01:00:18,859
gonna get the gig she calls back ten

1313
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:21,680
minutes later and I was like just

1314
01:00:18,859 --> 01:00:24,739
kidding you got it you can be remote

1315
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:27,259
like man that's she's not known for a

1316
01:00:24,739 --> 01:00:32,029
sense of humor but she's known for being

1317
01:00:27,259 --> 01:00:34,460
somebody who I love very much so I guess

1318
01:00:32,029 --> 01:00:36,589
the moral of that story is is if you're

1319
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:38,509
if you're attending this as a student or

1320
01:00:36,589 --> 01:00:42,440
even if you've been in this industry for

1321
01:00:38,509 --> 01:00:44,450
for the longest time if you want that

1322
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:47,210
stuff bad enough do not give up on it

1323
01:00:44,450 --> 01:00:49,549
all right take take all the talk set

1324
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:50,989
that you see and then go study go study

1325
01:00:49,549 --> 01:00:53,239
your brains out if you want something

1326
01:00:50,989 --> 01:00:54,559
bad enough right value these

1327
01:00:53,239 --> 01:00:56,890
interactions that you have with these

1328
01:00:54,559 --> 01:01:00,519
people today

1329
01:00:56,890 --> 01:01:04,970
see what else I had next year

1330
01:01:00,519 --> 01:01:07,339
I'm on my flight on my flight here I got

1331
01:01:04,970 --> 01:01:09,140
a chance to sit next to a the most

1332
01:01:07,339 --> 01:01:12,410
awesome old man I've ever met

1333
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:14,210
his name was literally Earl Redman cause

1334
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:15,710
I did you I didn't know what to the end

1335
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:17,150
of the flight I was like man I wish I

1336
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:20,390
had reveled in that for the entire

1337
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:22,190
flight and Earl was cooler I was 87 he

1338
01:01:20,390 --> 01:01:27,618
was going to a wedding here in

1339
01:01:22,190 --> 01:01:30,380
Cincinnati and he was a pilot and so we

1340
01:01:27,619 --> 01:01:31,789
sort and my advice is if you get to sit

1341
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:33,140
next to somebody as cool as Earl like

1342
01:01:31,789 --> 01:01:36,079
put your headphones away because you're

1343
01:01:33,140 --> 01:01:38,359
gonna learn some stuff whether you want

1344
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:40,730
to or not because Earl kept restarting

1345
01:01:38,359 --> 01:01:42,230
the stories I was like okay I'm guess

1346
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:45,130
I'm in a two-hour conversation but it

1347
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:47,089
was awesome and he said this phrase

1348
01:01:45,130 --> 01:01:50,150
that's just stuck with me and you can

1349
01:01:47,089 --> 01:01:52,339
read it a bunch of different ways he

1350
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:54,980
said he was he was telling a story about

1351
01:01:52,339 --> 01:01:57,200
the first time that he ever flew an

1352
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:58,309
airplane he was in the Air Force not the

1353
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:00,200
first time but one of his training

1354
01:01:58,309 --> 01:02:02,630
missions and they had always told him

1355
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:05,359
like don't fly into the clouds avoid the

1356
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:07,700
clouds as much as you can and I was like

1357
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:09,109
but they looked so fluffy like why

1358
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:10,308
wouldn't it be fun let me just go fly

1359
01:02:09,109 --> 01:02:13,460
through the clouds and then he looks

1360
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:15,890
amigos but they're really violent and he

1361
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:18,230
tells me this or story about how he like

1362
01:02:15,890 --> 01:02:20,299
came out flying upside down and

1363
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:21,710
everything looked so fluffy and awesome

1364
01:02:20,299 --> 01:02:24,890
but it was the most violent thing he's

1365
01:02:21,710 --> 01:02:27,549
ever been through I think there's a

1366
01:02:24,890 --> 01:02:30,799
lesson there for what we do in security

1367
01:02:27,549 --> 01:02:32,900
we have these ideas and we have these

1368
01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:35,150
things that we want to go after because

1369
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:37,160
we get nice paychecks and they're fun

1370
01:02:35,150 --> 01:02:38,480
and some of this stuff is sexy and we're

1371
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:40,640
gonna find the bad guys or we're gonna

1372
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:42,650
be the bad guys like I want to be a bad

1373
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:44,859
guy I want to break stuff for a while

1374
01:02:42,650 --> 01:02:49,980
like that's fun

1375
01:02:44,859 --> 01:02:52,089
but I wanted to tie the story into to

1376
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:53,289
remembering to take care of yourselves

1377
01:02:52,089 --> 01:02:57,730
as you do this

1378
01:02:53,289 --> 01:03:01,359
I mentioned my info sanity my infinity

1379
01:02:57,730 --> 01:03:04,299
website what we do is psychologically

1380
01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:06,480
violent a lot of the times whether it's

1381
01:03:04,299 --> 01:03:08,950
because there's so much thrown at us or

1382
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:12,220
we just get hopeless about what we're

1383
01:03:08,950 --> 01:03:15,489
doing don't like you can you're gonna

1384
01:03:12,220 --> 01:03:18,430
have those days but when you feel like

1385
01:03:15,489 --> 01:03:21,910
your energy is at the most bottom point

1386
01:03:18,430 --> 01:03:24,009
you can get to go to it be sides start

1387
01:03:21,910 --> 01:03:25,450
your own Meetup I start my I started my

1388
01:03:24,009 --> 01:03:26,980
own local meetup in Lehigh Valley in

1389
01:03:25,450 --> 01:03:29,828
Pennsylvania which is now an official

1390
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:32,950
Def Con group and it's the recharge I

1391
01:03:29,829 --> 01:03:36,369
need every month to say this is worth it

1392
01:03:32,950 --> 01:03:38,230
this is still fun and everything might

1393
01:03:36,369 --> 01:03:40,650
be broken but I'm still going to try to

1394
01:03:38,230 --> 01:03:40,650
fix it

1395
01:03:44,539 --> 01:03:51,679
I love this so much anybody who is

1396
01:03:48,650 --> 01:03:55,689
anybody familiar with with the with the

1397
01:03:51,679 --> 01:04:01,640
OSC P exam from office and security cool

1398
01:03:55,689 --> 01:04:02,660
this is their motto try harder and it's

1399
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:03,919
not the same when you're learning

1400
01:04:02,660 --> 01:04:06,499
something or somebody's trying to learn

1401
01:04:03,919 --> 01:04:09,949
something from you that you just ignore

1402
01:04:06,499 --> 01:04:13,249
them and say go figure it out I'm not

1403
01:04:09,949 --> 01:04:15,739
gonna help you lead them right lead

1404
01:04:13,249 --> 01:04:17,899
those junior analysts as you would have

1405
01:04:15,739 --> 01:04:20,359
liked to have be led by other higher

1406
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:22,880
tier analysts don't spoon feed them

1407
01:04:20,359 --> 01:04:25,160
don't just like don't just give them

1408
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:27,829
everything but make them try a little

1409
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:29,839
bit harder saying is this the absolute

1410
01:04:27,829 --> 01:04:31,969
best that you could have come up with

1411
01:04:29,839 --> 01:04:36,349
well what about this thing lead them

1412
01:04:31,969 --> 01:04:38,839
down that path but try harder is so much

1413
01:04:36,349 --> 01:04:40,880
more than just offloading responsibility

1414
01:04:38,839 --> 01:04:42,499
and saying you go figure it out you

1415
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:46,249
should if your student if you're

1416
01:04:42,499 --> 01:04:48,999
aspiring to do this never underestimate

1417
01:04:46,249 --> 01:04:52,779
your again your own power of will of

1418
01:04:48,999 --> 01:04:55,879
finding out things for yourselves and

1419
01:04:52,779 --> 01:04:57,109
the good ones among us the good analysts

1420
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:58,999
are going to tell you yes

1421
01:04:57,109 --> 01:05:01,069
congratulations you're on the right path

1422
01:04:58,999 --> 01:05:06,558
but you missed this thing so go try

1423
01:05:01,069 --> 01:05:08,900
harder I always keep this in mind but be

1424
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:10,909
kind to the people that you're mentoring

1425
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:13,189
mentoring it's a huge part of what we do

1426
01:05:10,909 --> 01:05:15,199
I think it's one of the cornerstones of

1427
01:05:13,189 --> 01:05:17,749
why Jack Daniel first created b-sides

1428
01:05:15,199 --> 01:05:19,789
it's one of the most amazing events that

1429
01:05:17,749 --> 01:05:21,379
you're ever going to go to and I've been

1430
01:05:19,789 --> 01:05:23,029
to a lot of them and they've all been

1431
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:25,869
awesome because Jack and still these

1432
01:05:23,029 --> 01:05:25,869
values in them

1433
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:31,440
so now is where I say thank you to

1434
01:05:29,490 --> 01:05:34,319

1435
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:36,119

1436
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:38,700

1437
01:05:36,119 --> 01:05:40,950
and I put thank-you slides in here to

1438
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:43,080

1439
01:05:40,950 --> 01:05:45,750
people who have one time or another told

1440
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:47,220
me to try harder that helped me with

1441
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:49,560
this presentation that where I was

1442
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:51,660
stressed out that I quit one of my dry

1443
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:56,150
runs after 15 minutes like you suck

1444
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:56,149
nobody's gonna care go eat your feelings

1445
01:05:57,500 --> 01:06:01,680

1449
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:11,730
by meeting these kinds of people at

1450
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:18,119

01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:29,040
favorite books that really helped me

1457

along in my career I talked about

1458
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:34,200
