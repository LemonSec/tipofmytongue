building black by the way just and I

17
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,350
understand you already created a little

18
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:51,239
bit but anyways um it's interesting how

19
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,370
be sad<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cincinnati started because it's</font>

20
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:56,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">really the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same type of concepts we have</font>

21
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,629
a dirty count<font color="#E5E5E5"> Adrian Crenshaw had a free</font>

22
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">metasploit class in Louisville Kentucky</font>

23
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:02,879
and we went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it and I presented on</font>

24
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:04,229
Venice plate portion of it and a lot of

25
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,360
stuff on social engineering stuff like

26
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:07,770
then exploit the and afterwards we're

27
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,600
all sitting at the table you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

28
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,100
drinking couple beers and I would Martin

29
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,240
a few others<font color="#E5E5E5"> and like hey we should</font>

30
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,729
start a conference out<font color="#CCCCCC"> here it really</font>

31
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,619
cool and you know it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole</font>

32
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:17,729
horseshoe library and globally needs and

33
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:20,220
it just kind of got a self-contained

34
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:21,600
ecosystem and so like it will start<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

35
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,130
conference and we kind of went all in

36
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,630
the first year in like well if you get

37
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,210
three or forms people we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can break even</font>

38
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,350
and so we end up getting a headache<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1500</font>

39
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">the first year or something like that so</font>

40
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:31,829
ended up going really well in those two

41
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,000
thousand last year actually shrunk it

42
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:34,829
this year a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit down to about</font>

43
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">1800 years lets you pack light on this</font>

44
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:39,179
last year but it's how that stuff starts

45
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,130
and you get together you you figure out

46
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:46,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">why would he want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong</font>

47
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:48,329
check oh yeah how<font color="#E5E5E5"> about now hey hey</font>

48
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:49,590
using technology i'm sorry yet don't

49
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:53,699
just don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> need it</font>

50
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:55,229
I just muted it again I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess so it's</font>

51
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,670
funny because these community things

52
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:57,899
really work and you know if you're

53
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">interested in doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff like this you</font>

54
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:01,350
can and I do what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I normally do so I</font>

55
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:02,250
come back home<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know talking the</font>

56
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,990
whole way we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should start a counter</font>

57
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,979
start a con I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all this and do</font>

58
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,408
all this maybe all this and then I pass

59
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:08,609
it all to my wife so my wife basically

60
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:09,599
runs der beek on now for lack of a

61
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,970
better term I don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> do much</font>

62
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:14,099
except for speaker approvals and we

63
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:16,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually had a meeting yesterday day</font>

for papers you know we had like I don't

66
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">know something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a hundred and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

67
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,569
submissions probably would take like an

68
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,680
hour to it took like eight<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours and</font>

69
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:24,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">then go through the call for paper</font>

70
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,349
submissions there's just us going<font color="#E5E5E5"> a DB</font>

71
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,650
and talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how much of weird</font>

72
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:30,328
stuff so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting there anyways if</font>

73
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:33,690
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know I'm one of the sexiest</font>

74
00:02:30,329 --> 00:02:34,890
men alive that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not photoshopped if</font>

75
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,480
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't seen that by the way yachts</font>

76
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:39,809
it's funny I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the Katie Couric</font>

77
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,010
show and the guy that<font color="#E5E5E5"> plays in Sherlock</font>

78
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">got his last name's cumberpatch or</font>

79
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:45,149
something like that a good show by the

80
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:46,590
way he was coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up next and so it said</font>

81
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,760
up next one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world's sexiest men</font>

82
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,290
alive and then they removed the next

83
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,200
piece and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then of course everyone all my</font>

84
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:53,638
friends on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter found that and so but</font>

85
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm keeping it I like it I like it I</font>

86
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:58,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">think I think it's accurate but what's</font>

87
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,420
interesting about I guess this right

88
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,190
here when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was on the Katie Couric</font>

89
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:05,220
shows it kind of plays home to the

90
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:06,389
social engineering side when we do

91
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,980
social engineering we go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

92
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:09,480
organization break into it the

93
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,858
sophistication level you need really<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

94
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,560
doesn't need to be crazy<font color="#E5E5E5"> right because</font>

95
00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:15,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">all of the users are vulnerabilities and</font>

96
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,380
when you go after an organization you

97
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:17,670
target them if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

98
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,930
somewhat believable or even like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

99
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,950
little tiny bit even not believable at

100
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,720
all they'll usually do whatever you

101
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,950
wanted to do like<font color="#E5E5E5"> sales people you can</font>

102
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,599
get to do whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to like you</font>

103
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">can be like hey can you download this</font>

104
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,849
piece of malware and run it for me

105
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,260
because I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to compromise your</font>

106
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:30,149
computer and they're like<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah but can I</font>

107
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,798
still get your sale I like well yeah

108
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:33,959
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll buy your product if you do</font>

109
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:36,000
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay cool you know obviously</font>

110
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:36,810
exaggerated but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> very similar</font>

111
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,150
what you can do and what we're seeing

112
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:41,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">now is traditional education awareness</font>

113
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:44,160
that we're used to like online cbts and

114
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:45,900
you know target of spearfishing the test

115
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,668
education awareness isn't as effective

116
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,470
anymore I don't know if in May saw the

117
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:51,720
blog post that I did but we researched a

118
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:52,889
group out of Nigeria and Nigerian scams

119
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,090
are usually like you know misspelled

120
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:55,380
words and stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were usually taught</font>

121
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:57,239
right well this group<font color="#E5E5E5"> was actually</font>

122
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,890
sophisticated they had like 30 to 40

123
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:00,239
people working in this basically a full

124
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:01,890
fledged company with different tiers of

125
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,390
support and they were targeting

126
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:05,760
organizations all across

127
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:07,529
you know all across<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ohio we had cases in</font>

128
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,149
Florida California pretty much all

129
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,860
around targeting basically the fortune

130
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,090
1000 list and going down so if you're

131
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,890
over a billion or more they're going

132
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:15,540
after you and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were doing which</font>

133
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:17,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">was really sophisticated is there a</font>

134
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,930
compromising your partners so<font color="#E5E5E5"> they would</font>

135
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,400
go after your partners that you already

136
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:22,230
have established relationships with and

137
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,640
compromise their emails and once they

138
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:25,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">compromised the emails they would start</font>

139
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,780
sending you know messages to the finance

140
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:29,310
department requesting refunds or you

141
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,109
know you know cut lines of credit from

142
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,940
the company or product or whatever and

143
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,410
so they start the communication from a

144
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,610
trusted email address from the partners

145
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,990
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> from there they would switch</font>

146
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,700
over to a different email address that

147
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:39,990
was very similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that you know didn't</font>

148
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,550
arouse any<font color="#E5E5E5"> suspicion on the vendor side</font>

149
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,990
and these companies were getting hit I'm

150
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:44,310
talking upwards of millions<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars</font>

151
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:46,590
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> companies were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wire</font>

152
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:48,990
transferring out in order to you know

153
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:50,130
get all this wire fraud going on so the

154
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,480
sophistication that we're seeing out

155
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:53,520
there I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean compromising trusted third</font>

156
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,960
parties or going after organizations

157
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,070
that you know you would trust in nature

158
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,510
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> making something is very similar</font>

159
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:59,219
there was some ones where they didn't

160
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:00,599
compromise the vendor but they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just made</font>

161
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,430
a domain name that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> very similar and</font>

162
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,200
started targeting and you can tell like

163
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,970
it's a tiered support because in the

164
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,440
event that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> emails aren't working</font>

165
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:09,780
they needed phone calls they had a tear

166
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,190
for spit for targeting people via phone

167
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,840
fishing so<font color="#CCCCCC"> they'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually call you up</font>

168
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:14,640
on the phone perfectly<font color="#CCCCCC"> good English</font>

169
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,900
accents calling you up and talking to

170
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,159
you you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> counting you that way so</font>

171
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,469
these things are getting really

172
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,000
sophisticated right now and so the

173
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:22,590
traditional things that we do around

174
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,760
education awareness we can easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> defeat</font>

175
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:25,349
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do in this</font>

176
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,300
presentation today is just walk you

177
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,950
through what we're taught today I guess

178
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,050
in education awareness and really where

179
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:33,479
we need to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of move to on both s</font>

180
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:35,010
attackers in order to test as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well as on</font>

181
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:36,930
the defense side in order to protect

182
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:38,190
against these types of attacks and these

183
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:40,800
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> really difficult because you</font>

184
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:42,060
literally have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you know change our</font>

185
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,070
dynamics of how we're training people

186
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,510
today<font color="#CCCCCC"> and before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we start I want to show</font>

187
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:47,070
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody seeing the Katie Couric</font>

188
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:49,110
interview<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did with the lady that I</font>

189
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:50,070
compromised if you have i'm going to

190
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:53,430
show you in a second<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feel really bad</font>

191
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:55,770
about one every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I show but yeah</font>

192
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:57,750
back you've shown the reason I want to

193
00:05:55,770 --> 00:06:00,450
show this is because targeting one

194
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:02,700
person is is relatively difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

195
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:04,140
if I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> after a bob I have to know</font>

196
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,250
everything about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bob and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for me to</font>

197
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">target Bob I need to know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> everything</font>

198
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,950
about his life I need to know what he

199
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,450
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> I need to know how I'm going to</font>

200
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,250
craft my attack and then I'm gonna go

201
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:14,130
after Bob now if I mess up a targeting

202
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:15,300
Bob what happens he now he's on

203
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,920
heightened alert right not to try to

204
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,740
figure out other ways around his high

205
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,730
alert sense so in this case I targeted

206
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,560
individual and obviously I have

207
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:24,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">permission to do this and everything a</font>

208
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,820
targeted individual and you'll see<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

209
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:28,110
easy it is just the target one person to

210
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,460
go after<font color="#E5E5E5"> now think about this in a much</font>

211
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:31,110
larger scale when you're targeting a

212
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:32,430
corporation or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a company right I'm going</font>

213
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:34,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">after company has thousands of employees</font>

214
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:35,730
or a few hundred employees here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

215
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:37,739
starts to get really easy because he a

216
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:38,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">multiple attackers I mess up on one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

217
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever let's go to another one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I go to</font>

218
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,700
no one no another one or a different

219
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:43,260
department or you know different

220
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:45,300
organization or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> partner anything I</font>

221
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:46,680
want you to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> after somebody so here's</font>

222
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:56,720
this here's a quick one it's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

223
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:56,720
only like three minutes think of that

224
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:06,420
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last thing you want to say to</font>

225
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:09,090
somebody I<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel like all my antivirus</font>

226
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:11,610
software update I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> taken a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

227
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:14,760
Russians I have your insulting your

228
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:16,860
comes into my home I really feel

229
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:19,170
strongly that that we've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything</font>

230
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:21,990
is possible to try and protect right

231
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:23,130
myself and my daughters so interesting

232
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,450
about this piece right here she actually

233
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,530
hired as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer consulting to come</font>

234
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:27,120
to her house a locker machine down

235
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:29,280
that's way above anything that I've ever

236
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,440
seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know actually happening out</font>

237
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,760
there so she would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be where you know top</font>

238
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">five percent you'll see in a second but</font>

239
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:39,719
top 5% of what I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> say is the best</font>

240
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:41,909
out there well that is very impressive

241
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,670
because you seem like you're extremely

242
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:47,160
ahead of the curve so we decided to<font color="#CCCCCC"> put</font>

243
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:50,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">gave it to the test to see if your</font>

244
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:52,740
comfort level what's your security is

245
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:55,650
actually warranted tell us what happened

246
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:58,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">how did you do when we gave you the</font>

247
00:07:55,650 --> 00:08:01,520
challenge<font color="#CCCCCC"> ah-ha by the way I'm just</font>

248
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,520
excited right now I just

249
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:08,790
Mike trust me you put<font color="#E5E5E5"> me through the</font>

250
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:10,110
test so he was Stephanie I would say

251
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:11,580
it's actually one of the top<font color="#E5E5E5"> five</font>

252
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:13,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">percent but I would say it's being</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> both</font>

253
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:15,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">secure you know everything of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> day</font>

254
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:18,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">really lock down all those good things</font>

255
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:20,370
and so clearly had plugged in open my

256
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:22,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">computer up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and less than 10 minutes or</font>

257
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:24,450
so heading fully designed a website it

258
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,650
looked real every way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> perform with</font>

259
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:27,780
who else that you would visit every

260
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:29,609
single day and it sends an email out and

261
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:31,530
as soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said thing looks very</font>

262
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:33,930
believable in every way she clicked<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

263
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:35,459
link and then from<font color="#E5E5E5"> there again less than</font>

264
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:37,199
10 minutes of set of time and Auntie

265
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:39,870
Maude's<font color="#E5E5E5"> bye-bye full access to her</font>

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:43,050
computer our webcam<font color="#E5E5E5"> there on all grant a</font>

267
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:45,660
virus everything completely<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess</font>

268
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:48,599
where I guess so much worse this is what

269
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:50,760
I start to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> really up to you were</font>

292
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:45,240
and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> she didn't know what was</font>

293
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,829
going on she knew<font color="#E5E5E5"> that something was</font>

297
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:52,980
identifying you know what she did every

298
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,199
day i looked on her social media i

299
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,400
looked at you know home<font color="#E5E5E5"> address and from</font>

300
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,200
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> i pulled records and i started</font>

301
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,520
looking and you know basically doing all

302
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,840
the stuff just to kind of do my open

303
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,250
source intelligence and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

304
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">i just set up something that she would</font>

305
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,980
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> every day just a website that she</font>

306
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:06,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">visited or you can tell that you made</font>

307
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,920
orders from and then you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i set it</font>

308
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">up and you know sent her a couple</font>

309
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,829
targeted emails and she clicked on it

310
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:12,750
and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know compromiser computing that</font>

311
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:14,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">was it so that's targeting one person</font>

312
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,470
think about thousands of people right

313
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:19,079
and that's where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a problem right</font>

314
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:20,730
now is because like it<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> break</font>

315
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,950
into the perimeter but it's a lot of

316
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:24,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">work like for me to go in and find a</font>

317
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:26,130
sequel injection flaw and to comb your

318
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,569
web applications and comb your external

319
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:28,620
presence and do the proper ocean it

320
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:30,840
takes a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and effort and</font>

321
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">believe me that part's important too but</font>

322
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,630
in order for me to go and build a

323
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:35,490
pretext and go after an organization con

324
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:36,390
somebody only it takes a little while<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

325
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:37,680
mean if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a really</font>

326
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:39,600
sophisticated one you're talking maybe a

327
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,560
day to build<font color="#E5E5E5"> something really cool and</font>

328
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,880
if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not talking about maybe</font>

329
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,310
something that will get picked up maybe

330
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,870
not talking maybe a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours so it's</font>

331
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:48,270
really easy<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get into this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff and</font>

332
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:50,790
so what I'm gonna talk about today<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

333
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:52,199
just education awareness in general what

334
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:53,910
we're taught destroying what we're

335
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,140
taught and then I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

336
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,490
releasing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new version of the social</font>

337
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:58,740
engineer toolkit today I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been working</font>

338
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:01,350

339
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:03,390
you know putting it up there and so

340
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:06,000
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of new stuff going out can</font>

341
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:11,550
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys hear me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">okay feedback what'd you do so I mutant</font>

343
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:17,609

344
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:19,170
working so the new version has a lot of

345
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,880
new all metallic factors have improved

346
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:22,349
on a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the other ones and you'll</font>

347
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,230
see a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that today when we kind of</font>

348
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:27,690
go through some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the feature sets so</font>

349
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:29,010
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how we have today</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright and</font>

350
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:31,230
this is how we target our organization

351
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:32,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">is what we're taught to do so we do our</font>

352
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:34,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">targeted spear phishing attacks for an</font>

353
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,610
organization whether you're a pen tester

354
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,750
or you're using some sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> third-party</font>

355
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:38,580
service or you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing that into your</font>

356
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,170
own we typically send what hundreds of

357
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:41,550
emails that<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a sample size right or</font>

358
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:43,969
thousands of<font color="#E5E5E5"> emails to do a sample size</font>

359
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:46,349
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we select let's just say you know</font>

360
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:47,550
5,000 people out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our 30,000 user</font>

361
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:49,230
population people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have gone through the</font>

362
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:52,260
education<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're in this program and then</font>

363
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:53,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there we send all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of our emails to</font>

364
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:55,020
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to understand how many people</font>

365
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,940
click through it that sound about right

366
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,840
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> from there once we understand how</font>

367
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,070
many people click through we have a

368
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,680
percentage<font color="#CCCCCC"> and if that percentage goes</font>

369
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:03,360
down we think we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> better right</font>

370
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,800
so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not what we're going to do as</font>

371
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,450
an attacker we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to use</font>

372
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,949
misspellings we're not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to grab</font>

373
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:09,990
percentages and metrics to see how many

374
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:12,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">people click on us we're in do something</font>

375
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:14,339
a little bit different what we do is we

376
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:18,870
target somebody they do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong</font>

377
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:22,380
I didn't bump anything anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

378
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:23,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so what we typically do is we</font>

379
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:25,650
target a small number of people like I'm

380
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:29,880
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe three to four people and</font>

381
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:32,370
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason we do that is why sound off</font>

382
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:35,460
alerts right so the higher number of

383
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:37,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">people you target the higher probability</font>

384
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:38,970
you have of being detected<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when that</font>

385
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:40,319
happens obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you get detected</font>

386
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:42,300
then it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard for us to actually go</font>

387
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,350
back and start doing our fish so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

388
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:48,000
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to try to what's going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

389
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:50,600
here mature turn so even if I turn this

390
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">off it's still</font>

391
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:57,739
someone did something bad so so we

392
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,390
target on a small number of people if I

393
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:01,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">talked to like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three or four people you</font>

394
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:03,110
usually don't have an issue going after

395
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:05,150
an organization and so if I customizes

396
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:07,220
the company itself to I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> it makes it</font>

397
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:08,180
even better like for example um and I'll

398
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about this a little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

399
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:11,540
phone fishing side but you know we go

400
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,190
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> a company we look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like the</font>

401
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:15,500
press release their new the news

402
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:16,250
releases their PR departments anything

403
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,540
that they're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the news because</font>

404
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:20,270
those are valuable pieces of information

405
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:21,800
that i can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use like for example just by</font>

406
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:24,230
sending like I we<font color="#CCCCCC"> own like a whole bunch</font>

407
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:26,569
of fake news media domains and just by

408
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:29,029
sending it from a<font color="#E5E5E5"> news media domain to a</font>

409
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:31,580
company's PR place and someone sends an

410
00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:35,960
email back what happens let me<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

411
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:37,310
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get from that email how they</font>

412
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,950
structure their email themselves like so

413
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:41,689
the signature the title the<font color="#CCCCCC"> colors the</font>

414
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:43,310
phone number structure everything that

415
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:45,350
you need in order to build a successful

416
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:46,609
fish so just by doing something simple

417
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:48,320
like that now you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> template to go</font>

418
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:51,080
off<font color="#CCCCCC"> of so when you start doing stuff</font>

419
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:59,350
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> now I lost it didn't I touched</font>

420
00:13:51,080 --> 00:14:02,420
us I'll just I'll just yell ah test test

421
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:04,070
so you know I'll usually do a lot of

422
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:05,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">things like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that just by just by getting</font>

423
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:06,860
enough information to customize my

attack<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right I'll talk a little</font>

425
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:12,680
about that in a second now in today's SE

online cbt i literally just click next

431
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,480
next next next next finish I don't want

432
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,979
to listen to this that was horrible why

433
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,720
would we do that to our<font color="#E5E5E5"> users if we're</font>

434
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:28,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">not going to even do it ourselves so the</font>

435
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,540
ones that<font color="#CCCCCC"> your training stuff does</font>

436
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,040
absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> no good when it comes to what</font>

437
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:33,020
were doing even if it's an intuitive or

438
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,939
entertaining you got to remind<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

439
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:36,290
how to do things like for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example when</font>

440
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:38,180
you join a company let's just say you

441
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:39,620
start from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new organization do you</font>

442
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,550
know the basic principles and things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

443
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,320
have to follow as far as day-to-day

444
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:44,240
activity like where the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lunch rooms at</font>

445
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,100
or you know how to wire you know how to

446
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,870
get paid or your benefits or things like

447
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,950
that do they send you open enrollment

448
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,630
stuff throughout the whole year or

449
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:52,490
things that to kind of keep you posted

450
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:53,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">of what's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the company those are</font>

451
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:55,160
same tough to the things we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do in</font>

452
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:58,250
security but you know that's what we

453
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:00,620
always typically see and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know in</font>

454
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:03,400
order to do that the training all<font color="#E5E5E5"> year</font>

455
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:05,270
long is a key concept for me I mean

456
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,079
let's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> say the target breach for</font>

457
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:08,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

458
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,830
sending emails out to individuals saying

459
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,820
hey you know this was compromises the

460
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:12,500
type of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you'd have to worry</font>

461
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,910
about relating it back to them is really

462
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,680
impersonal or how to secure your own

463
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:17,540
home wireless or you know how to protect

465
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:21,110

466
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:23,240
day<font color="#CCCCCC"> people do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not care about the company</font>

open it up disable your antivirus first

549
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:01,580
because it's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> a flag up you know</font>

550
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:02,600
and then from<font color="#CCCCCC"> there just open it up and</font>

an organization is through that versus

566
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,940
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that spend time on which</font>

567
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:33,530
is fishing in person<font color="#CCCCCC"> ses these are my</font>

568
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:35,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">favorites a lot of impersonation of</font>

569
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:38,059
delivery people been done impersonating

570
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,800
employee has been done piggybacking etc

571
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:41,870
etc then those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> still effective ways</font>

572
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:47,139
but the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we do I guess has</font>

573
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:49,699
attackers is we over complexity in there

574
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:51,590
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me when I go in I like to make it</font>

575
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:53,210
easy make it simple because what happens

576
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:55,370
when you do these overly complex attacks

577
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:56,960
is you start<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run into issues where it</font>

578
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:59,178
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> work because it's so overly</font>

579
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,730
complex if you were like wait a min our

want to hear you so she walks away and

640
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:51,360
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> she walks away and I'm basically</font>

641
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:53,250
unattended alone in this this medical

642
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,649
record area and so I plan to attend zee

643
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:57,240
device and one of the computers grabs me

644
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:58,740
a shell out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the network into the to</font>

645
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,180
the medical record area and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

646
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,770
also i see this like huge stack of

647
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:04,290
medical records so i have this like

648
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:05,730
small backpack i'm like i can't fit it

649
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:07,110
in there so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just like out whatever</font>

650
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:10,020
so I put my backpack on I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just carry the</font>

651
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:12,659
medical records out like this no

652
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:14,129
problems so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't need to do stuff</font>

653
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,300
that sophisticated just like spur the

654
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:16,770
moment you can do whatever you want see

655
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,330
because people believe people until you

656
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:19,889
violate somebody's trust like something

657
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:21,300
that's weird they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to care</font>

658
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:22,170
like you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not to be nervous or</font>

659
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,730
anything you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> just walk up to</font>

660
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:24,800
something like hey I need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> steal all</font>

661
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:25,820
those electronic an offer

662
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,950
as long as that's not weird to that

663
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:29,780
person you're cool right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> just do</font>

664
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:30,860
things that are simple and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

665
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:32,450
the problem we run<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in real-world</font>

666
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:33,290
ocz that's that's where the burgers are

667
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:34,430
going to do they're gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> do things that</font>

668
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:35,030
are simple they're going to blend in

669
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:36,560
they're not gonna do sophisticated

670
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:38,510
attacks and I can sit there<font color="#E5E5E5"> in lockpick</font>

671
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:40,040
doors and you know of a security camera

672
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:41,210
systems and stuff like that the letter

673
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">is going to walk into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the building as a</font>

674
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:45,710
normal person<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do whatever they want</font>

675
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:49,280
to you because that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how it works so</font>

676
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:50,330
here's what we teach our users phones

677
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,670
don't provide sensitive information

678
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:54,320
right and and it doesn't work because

679
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:55,880
they owe as long as you know again touch

680
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,710
Social Security numbers and birth dates

681
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,720
are fine check the caller ID and look

682
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:02,720
for suspicious activity phone fishings

683
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,920
my favorite this is a funny story we

684
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,540
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a pen test for a company a</font>

685
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:07,100
manufacturing company just celebrated

686
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:08,690
their hundred year anniversary so you

687
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,919
know real big deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this company and</font>

688
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:11,120
there was all over the media all over

689
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:14,000
the news and everything and they're

690
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">really excited about it and so when</font>

691
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,180
they're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this you know i saw this</font>

692
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:18,470
news and I'm like hey that's a perfect

693
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:20,030
pretext you know they're really excited

694
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:21,080
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this hundred year anniversary we</font>

695
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:23,149
should go and probably target them that

696
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:25,310
way so we go to the website the news

697
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:27,380
news organization and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> downloaded all</font>

698
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:29,270
the media criteria and hit this PDF

699
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:30,830
document that was up to the you know

700
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:32,720
like a release to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the outside world</font>

701
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:34,310
right what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> great about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the PDF</font>

702
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,230
document is now I know the exact format

703
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:37,970
that they use for the pdfs so everybody

704
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:39,380
believes it right it looks legit looks

705
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:41,060
good you might think well he's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

706
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:43,010
use a malicious PDF and send not into

707
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:44,810
that at all so what we did is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I sent an</font>

708
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:46,100
email<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the PR folks they send an email</font>

709
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:47,960

765
00:24:19,769 --> 00:24:22,590
the world to her and I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I don't</font>

766
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,639
know like the most horrible press I

767
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:26,100
bought her an iphone by the way just

768
00:24:23,639 --> 00:24:27,990
throwing that out there but Mike

769
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,879
knocking even expense it you can have it

770
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:31,049
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that horrible person</font>

771
00:24:29,879 --> 00:24:32,158
you know I'm it may look like it from

772
00:24:31,049 --> 00:24:35,190
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> KT interview but I'm really a good</font>

773
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:36,659
person and so one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> though I ran</font>

774
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:38,669
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that was that was interesting</font>

775
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:41,309
is um we had access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the computers</font>

776
00:24:38,669 --> 00:24:42,179
they had limited user accounts right so

777
00:24:41,309 --> 00:24:44,070
they weren't running as administrator

778
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:47,009
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem with that is that you</font>

779
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:48,720
know post exploitation wise it's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

780
00:24:47,009 --> 00:24:50,429
pivot if you don't have administrative

781
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,289
level access now when I say it's hard to

782
00:24:50,429 --> 00:24:53,759
pave it just takes more time for us and

783
00:24:52,289 --> 00:24:58,830
what happens around four or five o'clock

784
00:24:53,759 --> 00:25:00,119
at night people go<font color="#E5E5E5"> home right they you</font>

785
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,350
know close a laptop lid or they go<font color="#E5E5E5"> home</font>

786
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:02,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so they start losing its shells are</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that's just some fun stuff you can do</font>

creating this whole fantasy land that's

848
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:43,170
the cool part it's like when you find

849
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:44,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">that first zero day you're like whoa I</font>

850
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:45,720
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a zero day here and then it's like</font>

851
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">really not as your dick as the crash</font>

852
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,260
doesn't you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> anyways I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think you</font>

853
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:51,149
find one then it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool and but in this</font>

854
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:52,860
one you're building your whole whole you

855
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:53,880
know complete fantasy you're like

856
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,260
basically making something that's gonna

857
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,190
be not believable whatsoever to anybody

858
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:58,260
else except for the person you're

859
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:59,460
targeting and that's when it gets fun so

860
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,300
our users are taught to<font color="#CCCCCC"> hover</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

861
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:02,280
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> show you how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to defeat the</font>

862
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,720
hover here in a second check the domain

863
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,460
name suspicious activity again will

864
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,930
defeat all that here in a little bit my

865
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:09,060
favorite are those so let's talk about

866
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:10,440
defeating your technology we implement

867
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:12,810
certain things in our environments right

868
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:15,420
like certain pieces of technology that

869
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:18,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">are like apt prevention or you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> zero</font>

870
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:19,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">day detection or antivirus or</font>

871
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:21,870
application whitelisting and by the way

872
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:23,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">I still don't understand application</font>

873
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:24,239
whitelisting<font color="#E5E5E5"> is anything anybody here</font>

874
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:27,330
understand application where this thing

875
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,830
because as an attacker right<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

876
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:29,790
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I never understood and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said</font>

877
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:31,980
it when application whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> schema I'm</font>

878
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:34,020
like it doesn't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything different</font>

879
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:35,280
for us but anyways so if I'm an attacker

880
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,540
right and I'm going after<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

881
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,910
organization i'm going to compromise it

882
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:40,530
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going after your user population</font>

883
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:41,550
where's<font color="#CCCCCC"> your where's your application</font>

884
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:43,980
whether this is going to be installed at

885
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:45,419
the user population right so it's in the

886
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:46,980
user population and I need to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

887
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:48,540
need to attack a user so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

888
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,710
attack them in a way that compromises

889
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:51,659
them via something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they have on</font>

890
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:53,670
their computer right like IE adobe<font color="#E5E5E5"> java</font>

891
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:56,370
etc etc let me ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> you one night when i</font>

892
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:59,250
compromise those specific processes what

893
00:27:56,370 --> 00:28:01,979
am i running under a white listed

894
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:02,970
application I don't like so I go into

895
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,690
customers that have application

896
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:05,370
whitelisting I'm like

897
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:06,659
sup I did it I'm getting access to

898
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:08,699
everything I got and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then I tell them</font>

899
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:09,899
everything I did like did our

900
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,730
application while this thing stop him

901
00:28:09,899 --> 00:28:13,379
like oh you you had application

902
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:14,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">whitelist I mean yeah we had to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do some</font>

903
00:28:13,379 --> 00:28:16,289
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> cool they get around it i</font>

904
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:18,990
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean i didn't no idea was there</font>

905
00:28:16,289 --> 00:28:20,279
so you know there's certain technologies

906
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:22,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we have but we have to defeat these</font>

907
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:23,340
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> order to do social engineering and</font>

908
00:28:22,049 --> 00:28:24,809
get access<font color="#E5E5E5"> things right because we're</font>

909
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:27,240
putting two factor on are outside we're

910
00:28:24,809 --> 00:28:28,860
putting things in to protect access and

911
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,389
what my favorites is<font color="#E5E5E5"> two-factor</font>

912
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:32,250
authentication and implementation of

913
00:28:30,389 --> 00:28:33,799
those in olin razor<font color="#E5E5E5"> hammond assets but</font>

914
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:36,379
does anybody ever used phone factor

915
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:39,090
what's interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the phone factor is</font>

916
00:28:36,379 --> 00:28:41,009
you basically put the error back into

917
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:42,269
the human you've destroyed<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything that</font>

918
00:28:41,009 --> 00:28:43,649
we've taught around two factor

919
00:28:42,269 --> 00:28:45,720
authentication you gave it back to the

920
00:28:43,649 --> 00:28:47,039
person to error so with RSA tokens

921
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,809
whether you know everybody kind of has a

922
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,309
negative connotation out the RSA tokens

923
00:28:48,809 --> 00:28:52,529
but someone had to actually take that

924
00:28:50,309 --> 00:28:54,570
code and put it into a system to get

925
00:28:52,529 --> 00:28:57,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">access to it right what phone factor my</font>

926
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:58,470
favorite one is the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> four pen test</font>

927
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,330
we've been on so for Penn tested

928
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:02,039
headphone factor we compromised

929
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:04,320
credentials right we<font color="#CCCCCC"> login to let's just</font>

930
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:05,879
say owa or VPN and what happens is if

931
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,559
phone factor prompts up and says we're

932
00:29:05,879 --> 00:29:09,389
sending a text<font color="#CCCCCC"> message or recalling you</font>

933
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:11,279
or whatever to let you know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

934
00:29:09,389 --> 00:29:12,029
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see the verify who you are and</font>

935
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,799
make sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you're logging</font>

936
00:29:12,029 --> 00:29:15,389
in properly now what's going to happen

937
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:16,769
so what happens on the end user screen

938
00:29:15,389 --> 00:29:18,990
that we compromise is they<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a text</font>

939
00:29:16,769 --> 00:29:21,330
message<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay a text message says do you</font>

940
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:22,700
want to allow access in yes or<font color="#CCCCCC"> no what</font>

941
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:26,610
are they going to do every single time

942
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:28,440
yes every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time I have not found a</font>

943
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:32,039
company that hasn't hit yes when we do

944
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:34,110
phone factor yes every<font color="#CCCCCC"> single</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time so</font>

945
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:35,850
there goes your<font color="#CCCCCC"> to factor right but we</font>

946
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:36,809
have to defeat your other technology to

947
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:38,070
get around we have to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> around your</font>

948
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:39,779
apt prevention tools you have to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> rid</font>

949
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:40,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">of your next-generation firewalls</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

950
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:42,330
thinking around all this stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

951
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:45,590
what I'm gonna show you here is the new

952
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:45,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">version of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the social engineered silk it</font>

953
00:29:47,509 --> 00:29:51,419
now you might have<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen this before and</font>

954
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:54,570
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this has been in here for a long</font>

955
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:57,659
time this new version is really slick so

956
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:59,158
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Java applet attack method is kind of</font>

957
00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:00,600
the flagship<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess to the toolkit</font>

958
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:02,850
right it's the what everybody uses a lot

959
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:06,779
of times to compromise it and so in this

960
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:08,490
case the new<font color="#E5E5E5"> version of set it finds</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

961
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:10,230
bet it actually does predictive analysis

962
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:12,480
of how the best way to actually

963
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:14,039
compromise the actual computer so to say

964
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,240
okay you're running windows 7 i'm going

965
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:16,350
to build a profile of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you have</font>

966
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">installed on the machine and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font>

967
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:19,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">to compromise using the best</font>

968
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,970
method for success and if that fails my

969
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,350
try other methods and so it continues to

970
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:23,910
try different methods<font color="#E5E5E5"> of exploit ability</font>

971
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:26,370
to gain access yourself and everything's

972
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:27,840
done so it's brilliant kind of nasty it

973
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:29,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">every time it generates a Java applet</font>

974
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,590
it's a dynamic<font color="#E5E5E5"> cipher key with aes-256</font>

975
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:33,180
encryption and then that's changed

976
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:35,010
polymorphic<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lee every single time so it</font>

977
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:36,360
looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> different every single time any</font>

978
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:39,210
type of communications are going out so

979
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:40,620
it looks legit and it gets around a lot

980
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:41,760
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because we're using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font>

981
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:43,199
are already white listed as far as

982
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,730
application whitelisting we're not

983
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,740
actually writing anything to disk it's

984
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:48,240
all memory and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not actually using</font>

985
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:51,990
any type of exploit just if you have

986
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">Java installed you're screwed which is</font>

987
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:56,610
the case anyway if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> Java</font>

988
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:58,110
installed but so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna launch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

989
00:30:56,610 --> 00:31:00,419
social engineer toolkit now the new

990
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:02,610
version 6 what I added<font color="#CCCCCC"> is if you're</font>

991
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:04,260
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> cali it is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> familiar</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bleeding edge repos and cali if</font>

993
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:09,540
you're not the bleeding edge repos

994
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:11,280
really slick you make a configuration

995
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:12,840
change and it allows you to get daily

996
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:14,160
updates versus like what they actually

997
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,929
put in the packages which could be month

998
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:17,070
or weeks or whatever ends up being so

999
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:19,440
you get daily updates of like all your

1000
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:21,629
poor tools like<font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit set aircrack</font>

1001
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,430
recon ng all of them go automatically

1002
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:25,200
package for you automatically so the new

1003
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:27,180
version automatically check to see if

1004
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,110
you're using cali for using cali it

1005
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:29,190
checks to see if you're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1006
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:30,510
bleeding edge repos and if you're not

1007
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:32,250
it'll prompt you to say do you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1008
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:33,270
install<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bleeding edge</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rebuilt and</font>

1009
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:34,710

1011
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:38,880
little thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> added into set so</font>

1012
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,350
remember the social<font color="#E5E5E5"> engineering attacks</font>

1013
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,360
we're going to go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the website attack</font>

1014
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:44,280
vectors which is number<font color="#E5E5E5"> two and then</font>

1015
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:46,080
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Java applet</font>

1016
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:48,480

1017
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,710
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to clone a website and we're going</font>

00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,850
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we're not going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use natta port</font>

1019

1020
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:54,949
local here let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> grab my IP address</font>

1021
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:54,949
real quick

1022
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:06,330
and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> Java introduced recently was I</font>

1023
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:07,799
i think was java<font color="#CCCCCC"> the update update 39 or</font>

1024
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:10,770
something like that they disallow

1026
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:13,980
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> big deal for us what you need to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1027

1040
00:32:33,169 --> 00:32:36,540
attackers out there using legitimate

1041
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:38,429
code signing certificates it's what

1042
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:40,020
everybody's using now so just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go and get</font>

1043
00:32:38,429 --> 00:32:41,940
a code signing<font color="#CCCCCC"> sir</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's tues it's</font>

1044
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:43,020

1045
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:44,280
spent for there and then the two hundred

1046
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:46,740
bucks for a two-year code signing sir

1047
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,940
and now you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a legit allegedly</font>

1048
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:49,260
signed code section with whatever you

1049
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:50,880
want it to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of times we'll</font>

1050
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:53,040
actually just by like doing business<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

1051
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,440
the company name you know this is secure

1052
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:57,000
you know and then so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone we buy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> coke</font>

1053
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">code sensor that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's all good and legit</font>

1054
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,260
so just go<font color="#CCCCCC"> buy legit cert it's easy to</font>

1055
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,400
do takes you about a week or so<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

1056
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,179
make sure you give your build yourself a

1057
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,040
week to actually go through the

1058
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:06,870
verification process but really easy to

1059
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:10,500
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use it all time I'm gonna use my</font>

1060
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:12,178
own<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple that's built in now the new</font>

1061
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,230
version is set<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually help you build</font>

1062
00:33:12,179 --> 00:33:16,620
it too if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> generate your</font>

1063
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:18,630
it'll actually generate your own request

1064
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:20,309
you submit it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and comes back and then it</font>

1065
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:21,600
imports that<font color="#E5E5E5"> code</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sending certain to set</font>

1066
00:33:20,309 --> 00:33:23,610
from from there on out so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's new to</font>

1067
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:28,290
and I'm just going trust a sec as an

1068
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:29,490
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so we call in the</font>

1069
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:30,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">website it's automatically going to</font>

1070
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:32,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">import the website right all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its bad</font>

1071
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:35,699
stuff going to get around antivirus

1072
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:37,799
Hindu injection now we can fly over HTTP

1073
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:39,380
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> HTTPS using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> metasploit and what's</font>

1074
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:42,690
interesting if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you didn't notice or not</font>

1075
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:44,280
most proxies actually blocked a default

1076
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:46,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">metasploit payload in the second stage</font>

1077
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:49,590
coming back because what happens with

1078
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:51,210
the reverse HTTP and HTTPS proxy is it

1079
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:53,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually goes out and pulls a PE file or</font>

1080
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:54,929
a binary so it actually calls out you

1081
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:56,639
know HTTP and HTTPS and it pulls a

1082
00:33:54,929 --> 00:33:58,559
binary back which most content filters

1083
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,570
don't like but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can actually go into</font>

1084
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:04,080
the second fig you go in the second fig

1085
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:06,230
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll show you real quick</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1086
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,230
turn

1087
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:20,040
enables stage notice you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can turn stage</font>

1088
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:23,520
encoding<font color="#E5E5E5"> to on and then basically it</font>

1089
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:25,199
will create a polymorphic blob that

1090
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,579
it'll just download it at that it'll

1091
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,290
download it that way versus actually

1092
00:34:26,579 --> 00:34:30,059
using it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> download by nurse that</font>

1093
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:32,569
gets around most content filters and

1094
00:34:30,059 --> 00:34:34,440
things like that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have out there</font>

1095
00:34:32,569 --> 00:34:36,058
but anyways we have everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> set up</font>

1096
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:47,069
here we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the IP address</font>

1097
00:34:36,059 --> 00:34:48,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think it's just me so when my 134 1341</font>

1098
00:34:47,069 --> 00:34:50,399
front one now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I register domain name</font>

1099
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:51,270
that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> look similar in every way I</font>

1100
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:53,219
mean I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would do everything that looks</font>

1101
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:54,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">legit right and I make it you know I'd</font>

1102
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:55,678
send a spear fish out like I did with

1103
00:34:54,418 --> 00:34:59,129
the the one for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the manufacturing</font>

1104
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:00,750
company and we can make<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like that</font>

1105
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:02,430
sound you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> make the name whatever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1106
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:03,359
want to write and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can make publisher</font>

1107
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:05,368
whatever you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> success to doing</font>

1108
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:06,660
business apps so you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> do business</font>

1109
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:08,130
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever the you can be verified</font>

publisher you know this publisher has

1111
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:11,069
been verified insecure whatever you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

1114
00:35:12,059 --> 00:35:15,480
publisher usually like you know somewhat

1115
00:35:13,829 --> 00:35:17,400
nondescript it because you can reuse it

1116
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:19,049
on other attacks but then on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the name</font>

1117
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,819
part you can just make the name whatever

00:35:19,049 --> 00:35:22,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">you want to it's just a manifest update</font>

1119
00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:24,960
on the Java applet and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the</font>

trust a sec whatever you want to do and

1123
00:35:27,809 --> 00:35:32,069
as soon as you get run and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way</font>

1124
00:35:29,549 --> 00:35:34,109
this soab venner's used to write

1125
00:35:32,069 --> 00:35:35,430
signatures from my java applet so i

1126
00:35:34,109 --> 00:35:37,710
spent about three months writing a

1127
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:39,240
polymorphic encrypted jar file that's

1128
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:41,220
completely dynamic there's not one piece

1129
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:43,439
of static code in it whatsoever so every

1130
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:45,029
every 30 minutes a new jar file gets

1131
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,710
uploaded github and they finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> gave up</font>

1132
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:49,530
after like 12 attempts so you have to

1133
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:50,849
worry about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> game picked up hit run</font>

1134
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:53,010
it's going to redirect back the

1135
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:54,150
legitimate site just like before so now

1136
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:55,920
we're at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the legitimate trust as heck</font>

1137
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:57,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">com site</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and over here we have full</font>

1138
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,099
access to the computer and again we're

1139
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:01,200
not actually running any type of exploit

1140
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:03,720
here this is just<font color="#CCCCCC"> how Java socks by</font>

1141
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,129
design so you have no<font color="#CCCCCC"> worries you know</font>

1142
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,149
you don't to worry about again capaz or

1143
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:07,410
anything else you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just run it and you</font>

1144
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:09,559
exploit I mean you're fully you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it</font>

1145
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:11,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">can fully compromise that much is great</font>

1146
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:13,920
now the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is my personal favorite</font>

1147
00:36:11,819 --> 00:36:15,390
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> has been in set for a while but I</font>

1148
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,549
rewrote a large portion of it is

00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:19,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">original introduced by a guy named m</font>

1154
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:27,030
are basically our entire hover so we

1155
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:28,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">will hover over a link or talk to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1157
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:32,960
that so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get around the hover and</font>

1158
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:36,840
basically destroy education awareness I

1159
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:38,010
actually feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad about this one too so</font>

1160
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,840
we're gonna go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the web jacking attack</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to go to the site cloner and I'm IP</font>

1165
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:53,700
attack<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the way I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would do this is</font>

1166
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:55,110
that register a domain name that's very

1167
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,310
similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the company name like off for</font>

1168
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:58,380
example just say<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's targeting trusted</font>

1169
00:36:56,310 --> 00:37:00,090
sec benefits and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> after</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1170
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:01,950
benefits side because it's close to open

1171
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:03,690
enrollment things like that and what i

1172
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:05,370
would do is that register like benefits

1173
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:06,660
dash trusted commerce rustic dash

1174

1175
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:09,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">something that's similar to theirs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1176
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,319
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i needed domain that's</font>

1177
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:12,090
relatively simple for them at least

1178
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,860
initially first click the link and then

1179
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:15,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there I design an entire website</font>

1180
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:16,950
and in the website<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can put listen</font>

1181
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:18,660
make sure you hover over the link make

1182
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:20,189
sure it's using SSL make sure it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a</font>

actually benefits dot trusted sex.com

1187
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:32,880
would you believe it what you're saying

1188
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:39,810
no now but you some hogwash you know

1189
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:40,910
that before I got in here so obviously

1190
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:42,930
I'd make this look a little bit nicer

1191
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:45,029
I'd make the whole site and I sempre

1192
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:46,410
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a demo but if you what's it</font>

1193
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:49,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">look like on the bottom left to you and</font>

1194
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:52,710
we can every see that what's it<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

1195
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:55,680
accounts dot google.com<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so that's</font>

1196
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:56,880
safe right obviously you're looking at

1197
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,310
me really skeptical now you're like<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

1198
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:03,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's not right education awareness</font>

1199
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:04,500
taught me I can do this but so you look

1200
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:05,460
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in its accounts that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> google app</font>

1201
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">so i'm hovering over this right this</font>

1202
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:08,460
works in IE works on firefox works on

1203
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:10,440
chrome works and everything else this is

1204
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:12,420
the beauty by the way of browser flaws

1205
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:14,220
because these aren't considered browser

1206
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:15,420
flaws as far as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> browser's cuz</font>

1207
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:16,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's not an expert that i'm running</font>

1208
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:19,200
or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that that's why don't</font>

1209
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:20,520
you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> used to be a lot into the</font>

1210
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,189
exploit<font color="#CCCCCC"> research and I still do some</font>

1211
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:24,450
it's fun but you know when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you find</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1212
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:25,800
browser flaw like it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a it's a</font>

1213
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:27,450
memory corruption flower you have to do

1214
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,070
some some crazy heat magic and stuff

1215
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:30,660
like that what happens when you first

1216
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:34,110
use the first time or you disclose it is

1217
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:36,690
what it gets fixed right so instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1218
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:37,530
finding actual flaws in specific

1219
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:39,210
browsers why not

1220
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:40,950
fine features in browsers they're never

1221
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:42,690
going to fix that we can use to exploit

1222
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:43,680
them forever and so this one is

1223
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:44,670
interesting because it works on all of

1224
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,839
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's how it's designed and by the</font>

1225
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:47,340
way it works if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have no script on</font>

1226
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:51,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">two is no JavaScript involved in this or</font>

1227
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:52,500
nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it's really evil I don't so</font>

1228
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:55,020
again I counts that Google to calm now

1229
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:56,910
watch what happens really closely<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

1230
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:58,800
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to click the link in my computer</font>

1231
00:38:56,910 --> 00:39:01,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">my browser is physically going to be at</font>

1232
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,060
accounts<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> google com</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok everybody</font>

1233
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:04,440
realize that i'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> computer will be</font>

1234
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:05,730
at accounts like google com so i'll be

1235
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,230
there the websites going to load from

1236
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:08,760
their accounts like google com servers

1237
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:10,320
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm gonna do a quick switcheroo</font>

1238
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,190
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would use a domain name that's</font>

1239
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,770
similar to this and make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

1240
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:15,750
believable but watch what happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

1241
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:18,560
actually at accounts like google com

1242
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:23,970
right quick switcheroo let me see that

1243
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:25,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">quick switcheroo username password now</font>

1244
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:32,910
over it redirects back to legitimate

1245
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:34,830
site and then over here i'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

1246
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:37,440
which one it is you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> here we harvest</font>

1247
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:38,819
using a password and<font color="#CCCCCC"> suck ability</font>

1248
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,290
defeats what we're taught for education

1249
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:42,810
awareness right that's a pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> nasty</font>

1250
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:45,150
one so but it works really<font color="#E5E5E5"> well then we</font>

1251
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:46,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">use this all time because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it you know no</font>

1252
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,370
one's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pick up on they're not</font>

1253
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:48,480
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sit there and just stare at the</font>

1254
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:49,770
domain as it's going through especially

1255
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:53,280
if you register something similar to it

1256
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:55,590
so it works out really well so what

1257
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,210
we're going to do is play a little game

1258
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:58,650
okay I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to play a game because I</font>

1259
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:59,430
like games and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun and active</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

1260
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:00,690
what who doesn't give you multiple

1261
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,830
choice ABC and D and yet to tell me

1262
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,000
which ones you would use in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1263
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:04,440
stop these attacks from happening okay

1264
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,050
the first one we do is a job APPL attack

1265
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:13,050
so ABC or D which one would actually

1266
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:15,120
prevent this attack you ready all the

1267
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:21,800
above good call sir could call a call

1268
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:25,350
that's right yeah no for reals though

1269
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:26,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">ABC or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> D disallow execution from temp</font>

1270
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:28,200
disallow execution from all user

1271
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:30,930
profiles this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a lot regular</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> users</font>

1272
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:33,830
from execution<font color="#E5E5E5"> PowerShell d remove Java</font>

1273
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:33,830
are secured if possible

1274
00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:39,319
all the above yes so I don't if you

1275
00:40:37,759 --> 00:40:41,149
noticed or not but<font color="#CCCCCC"> um you actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1276
00:40:39,319 --> 00:40:42,859
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> group policy right now application</font>

1277
00:40:41,149 --> 00:40:44,058
whitelisting<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right it's called app</font>

1278
00:40:42,859 --> 00:40:45,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">Locker you also have what are called</font>

1279
00:40:44,059 --> 00:40:46,519
software restriction policies there in

1280
00:40:45,469 --> 00:40:48,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">group policy you can configure them now</font>

1281
00:40:46,519 --> 00:40:50,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay what you can do is if you disallow</font>

1282
00:40:48,619 --> 00:40:51,229
execution from temp and all user profile

1283
00:40:50,359 --> 00:40:52,279
you're literally<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to stop about</font>

1284
00:40:51,229 --> 00:40:53,899
eighty percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them our because we're</font>

1285
00:40:52,279 --> 00:40:55,009
most of them run it so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just do that</font>

1286
00:40:53,899 --> 00:40:56,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">minor change it's not going to impact</font>

1287
00:40:55,009 --> 00:40:57,799
your users much unless they actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> run</font>

1288
00:40:56,209 --> 00:40:59,209
executable from<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten but literally you're</font>

1289
00:40:57,799 --> 00:41:00,380
going to stop a large portion now you're

1290
00:40:59,209 --> 00:41:03,529
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to stop set because set</font>

1291
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:06,109
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> run any executables so it's</font>

1292
00:41:03,529 --> 00:41:07,579
purely in memory but I do use<font color="#CCCCCC"> PowerShell</font>

1293
00:41:06,109 --> 00:41:09,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">for my injection technique at least one</font>

1294
00:41:07,579 --> 00:41:10,219
of them and so I'm if you know this or

1295
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:12,348
not but you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually disallow</font>

1296
00:41:10,219 --> 00:41:14,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">PowerShell from executing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for normal</font>

1297
00:41:12,349 --> 00:41:15,679
users you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can say normal users inside</font>

1298
00:41:14,209 --> 00:41:17,209
app Locker normally users cannot execute

1299
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:19,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">PowerShell do normal users ever need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1300
00:41:17,209 --> 00:41:21,348
access<font color="#E5E5E5"> PowerShell know all the</font>

1301
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:23,658
administrators right so you can disallow

1302
00:41:21,349 --> 00:41:24,919
normal execution from PowerShell and all

1303
00:41:23,659 --> 00:41:26,179
of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sudden</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you just disable a large</font>

1304
00:41:24,919 --> 00:41:28,640
portion of the attack vectors and<font color="#CCCCCC"> set</font>

1305
00:41:26,179 --> 00:41:29,869
now in the Java side a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us can't</font>

1306
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:32,959
remove job in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our corporations because</font>

1307
00:41:29,869 --> 00:41:33,589
well yeah it's whole nother story<font color="#CCCCCC"> one we</font>

1308
00:41:32,959 --> 00:41:35,058
probably don't even know how to

1309
00:41:33,589 --> 00:41:38,109
uninstall because installer so jacked up

1310
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:40,159
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> um let me see I'll like Java a lot</font>

1311
00:41:38,109 --> 00:41:43,038
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you can do is you can put it in</font>

1312
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:44,719
like a hike a hyper-v instance or a nap

1313
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:46,159
virtualization pool and what I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen a</font>

1314
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:48,169
lot of companies do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just whitelist</font>

1315
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:49,999
applications that are allowed so you

1316
00:41:48,169 --> 00:41:51,949
know if it requires a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Java to actually</font>

1317
00:41:49,999 --> 00:41:53,598
load and run then you wait list then

1318
00:41:51,949 --> 00:41:54,889
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's in its own at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> V farm</font>

1319
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:55,729
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> voi</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> listed only the applications you</font>

1320
00:41:54,889 --> 00:41:57,619
need then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a separate browser</font>

1321
00:41:55,729 --> 00:41:59,058
for people to do normal browsing on it's

1322
00:41:57,619 --> 00:42:03,709
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that big of a change and it works</font>

1323
00:41:59,059 --> 00:42:05,359
really well so all above nothing's

1324
00:42:03,709 --> 00:42:07,399
bulletproof can get around software

1325
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:10,429
restriction policies and applique in app

1326
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:11,538
Locker but it definitely helps out now

1327
00:42:10,429 --> 00:42:13,130
here's a quick point<font color="#E5E5E5"> proof of concept</font>

1328
00:42:11,539 --> 00:42:15,130
that did on the PowerShell injection

1329
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:18,019
stuff oh no that was this is bypassing

1330
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:20,209
this is bypassing soft restriction

1331
00:42:18,019 --> 00:42:21,649
policies this is the magic unicorn

1332
00:42:20,209 --> 00:42:23,299
attack this is where you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> PowerShell</font>

1333
00:42:21,649 --> 00:42:24,949
injection um it's all<font color="#E5E5E5"> in github so if</font>

1334
00:42:23,299 --> 00:42:26,269
you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> check it out the source</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1335
00:42:24,949 --> 00:42:28,519
open there but basically this injection

1336
00:42:26,269 --> 00:42:30,408
into memory using<font color="#E5E5E5"> Matthew grabbers</font>

1337
00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:31,968
attack but it's a lot better works on 64

1338
00:42:30,409 --> 00:42:34,279
32 but not better<font color="#E5E5E5"> than math engraver but</font>

1339
00:42:31,969 --> 00:42:37,909
the tax improves so it works on 64 and

1340
00:42:34,279 --> 00:42:39,769
32 bit platforms now the web jacking is

1341
00:42:37,909 --> 00:42:41,389
tough because it takes advantage<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our</font>

1342
00:42:39,769 --> 00:42:42,799
human weaknesses right I mean that

1343
00:42:41,389 --> 00:42:45,139
literally is like destroying everything

1344
00:42:42,799 --> 00:42:48,099
that were taught so what's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix</font>

1345
00:42:45,139 --> 00:42:48,099
this one a B C or D

1346
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:58,760
it's not d although<font color="#CCCCCC"> its kind to be it's</font>

1347
00:42:56,580 --> 00:43:00,690
a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit d all right not really</font>

1348
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,890
education awareness<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't help I mean</font>

1349
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:03,180
the more you teacher uses the more they

1350
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:04,799
can look for suspicious activity like if

1351
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:06,270
they're you know computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> starts doing</font>

1352
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,980
weird things they see the redirect for

1353
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:09,540
some reason report it understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1354
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:11,580
that's coming into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the security team</font>

1355
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:13,500
some technological controls might might

1356
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:15,420
stop it like for example one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my</font>

1357
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:16,350
favorite ones is in content filtering

1358
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:18,060
I'm software like what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're using</font>

1359
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:19,440
blue coat or scan<font color="#E5E5E5"> safe or whatever it</font>

1360
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:22,020
ends up being they have something<font color="#CCCCCC"> called</font>

1361
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,910
uncategorised sites in in<font color="#CCCCCC"> ninety nine</font>

1362
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:25,350
percent of your your malicious sites

1363
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:27,210
that are fishing are going to come from

1364
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:28,980
those uncategorised sites so if you just

1365
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:31,320
block those you're literally going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1366
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:32,910
have maybe like a point<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 1 percent</font>

1367
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,960
increase in sites that people are trying

1368
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:35,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get to you then you just white</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> listen</font>

1369
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:37,080
you're fine it doesn't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that much</font>

1370
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:37,860
impact on the business and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same time</font>

1371
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're literally stopping like</font>

1372
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:41,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">ninety-nine percent of websites out</font>

1373
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,990
there now to get around it is trivial

1374
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:45,270
right all i need to do is submit my site

1375
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:46,470
to one of the content filtering you know

1376
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:47,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">companies and we do it to all of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them so</font>

1377
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:48,839
we do like<font color="#E5E5E5"> all six of home or something</font>

1378
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:50,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">me like six of them we send it to and</font>

1379
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:51,570
then they basically categorize you is

1380
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:53,430
whatever it is and it's funny because

1381
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:55,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">one of them you can actually clone the</font>

1382
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:57,210
company the the web content filtering

1383
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:59,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">companies own website and our category</font>

1384
00:43:57,210 --> 00:44:01,350
it actually categorize you as a content

1385
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:02,280
filtering company it's like I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1386
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:03,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna tell you which one but I mean it</font>

1387
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:07,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">is like we've been using that forever</font>

1388
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:07,700
it's like weird I learned that<font color="#CCCCCC"> from Eric</font>

1389
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:13,919
so anyways maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> see Andy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Arabian Sea</font>

1390
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:16,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay now some other things to ponder</font>

1391
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">education awareness is key two-factor</font>

1392
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:19,680
authentication as long as you implement

1393
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:20,730
it right uncategorised sites<font color="#CCCCCC"> up-to-date</font>

1394
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,500
software<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean when we still go into</font>

1395
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:24,930
companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> we see MSO 267 is ridiculous</font>

1396
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:26,160
least restriction is possible has

1397
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:28,560
anybody used the enhancement agaciro

1398
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,700
install kit or Emmett if you haven't

1399
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,590
write that down it's like the coolest

1400
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:33,120
thing ever it's free it's from microsoft

1401
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:34,500
it literally stops almost all of this

your<font color="#E5E5E5"> days to come out today and doesn't</font>

1403
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,870
have a major impact in any of your

1404
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,759
applications and it's low-hanging fruit

1405
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:40,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it's like you know low low resource</font>

1406
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:42,300
pool<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at literally stops a large</font>

1407
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,200
portion of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 days</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't think</font>

1408
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:46,920
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero day out there right now</font>

1409
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:49,259
that stops it except for jared de menthe

1410
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:51,450
did a talk recently on bypassing all the

1411
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:53,160
emmett mitigation techniques but it

1412
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:55,680
makes a dex point much more difficult to

1413
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:58,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">do in fact there's an exploit released</font>

1414
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:59,700
recently I was an<font color="#E5E5E5"> I easier</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> today</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

1415
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,230
actually looked for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> EMA dll is the</font>

1416
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,560
first exploit that actually looked for

1417
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:03,300
Emmet

1418
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:04,830
and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it saw the M a dll is just stop</font>

1419
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:07,410
itself and didn't run<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that's pretty</font>

1420
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:08,730
cool I mean really<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's really it is</font>

1421
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:09,990
kind of complex to install I mean like

1422
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:11,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">really complex you live have to double</font>

1423
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:13,649
click the msi and hit next next next use

1424
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:15,089
recommended settings and finish so it

1425
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:16,650
takes a lot of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and effort not to do</font>

1426
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:19,410
and actually hooks into active directory

1427
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:20,910
which is even even crazier hard to do so

1428
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:26,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know limit i can stop a lot of that</font>

1429
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:28,440
stuff so getting better when i look at

1430
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:30,900
what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing today i literally look</font>

1431
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:32,130
at us as being like in the 1990s say

1432
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:34,680
couple you laughs I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that old and I</font>

1433
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:39,030
now feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm getting old but that</font>

1434
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:39,990
hair is amazing but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I feel like</font>

1435
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:41,460
the attacks were doing haven't

1436
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:43,140
progressed all the USB drops literally

1437
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:44,490
we've been doing since 1990 the fishing

1438
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:45,779
campaigns with misspellings and stuff

1439
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:47,879
like that would induce night and we have

1440
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:49,110
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus on changing our dynamics is the</font>

1441
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:52,290
attackers are doing a lot of different

1442
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:53,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">things that are more sophisticated so we</font>

1443
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:55,020
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be more sophisticated to as we</font>

1444
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:56,640
go along and do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this because we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

1445
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:58,320
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> better as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an industry I'll</font>

1446
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:00,779
tell you so that company that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I talked</font>

1447
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:02,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">about doing that that iphone attack with</font>

1448
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:03,990
right so that was the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> year we did</font>

1449
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,790
it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is this is the third year</font>

1450
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:08,370
we've been testing him the third year we

1451
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:11,250
tested<font color="#CCCCCC"> them extremely difficult to get</font>

1452
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:12,270
into like i'm talking like I speak my

1453
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:14,310
phone number coming from inside the

1454
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:15,540
company with HR to a person asking hey

1455
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:17,070
we had a crash in our HR system blah

1456
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:18,900
blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> blah and just need to verify a</font>

1457
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:20,130
couple pieces of information she

1458
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:21,150
wouldn't do it she's like you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1459
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:22,500
physically come down here walk

1460
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:23,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">downstairs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to my desk and tell me do</font>

1461
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:25,440
because I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> who you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are I mean</font>

1462
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:26,730
and she's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I'm not seeing you know</font>

1463
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,840
our database and I'm like oh it's this

1464
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:29,910
name she said ok<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll see in the</font>

1465
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:31,530
database<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still don't trust e so I</font>

1466
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:32,640
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to that point and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it can</font>

1467
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:35,070
work I mean you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

1468
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:37,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">your employees super paranoid but you</font>

1469
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:37,920
know regular testing and actually going

1470
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:40,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">through and doing things that are</font>

1471
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,820
proactive all the time make a huge

1472
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:43,770
difference I mean it<font color="#CCCCCC"> really does and</font>

1473
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:45,120
it's funny when you first go through a

1474
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:46,410
social engineering campaign that's legit

1475
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:48,900
like a full-fledged one we're going

1476
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:50,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">after people people get pissed I don't</font>

1477
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:52,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">even got through one of those but like</font>

1478
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:54,000
it's a political like storm like I mean

1479
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:55,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">people are like you're targeting me I</font>

1480
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,110
feel violated<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know is he going my</font>

1481
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:59,189
home computer you know they did people

1482
00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:00,990
don't understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but you if you</font>

1483
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:02,460
least do education awareness first and

1484
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:03,419
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like move yourself in a little</font>

1485
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:04,230
bit kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of explain what you're trying</font>

1486
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:07,080
to do and then from<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you start</font>

1487
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:08,910
during testing it works<font color="#E5E5E5"> really well so</font>

1488
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:10,290
for me personally the most critical part

1489
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:11,399
of information security program isn't

1490
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:12,058
compliance it isn't vulnerably

1491
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,019
management it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1492
00:47:12,059 --> 00:47:14,999
pentesting doesn't anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

1493
00:47:13,019 --> 00:47:16,709
education awareness for me education

1494
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:18,118
awareness is like the foundation of

1495
00:47:16,709 --> 00:47:20,549
building a security program when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

1496
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:22,829
at diebold I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> diebold and you</font>

1497
00:47:20,549 --> 00:47:24,869
know it was a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> immature program</font>

1498
00:47:22,829 --> 00:47:27,539
right so the first thing I did is not

1499
00:47:24,869 --> 00:47:29,099
what patch ms 367 or passion file or

1500
00:47:27,539 --> 00:47:31,430
patch a web server although I did

1501
00:47:29,099 --> 00:47:33,809
anyways less along a hole in our story

1502
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:35,430
but you know I didn't do all those

1503
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:37,259
things at first<font color="#E5E5E5"> I focused on education</font>

1504
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:38,549
to the people so getting by off on from

1505
00:47:37,259 --> 00:47:40,019
our executives and working with<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

1506
00:47:38,549 --> 00:47:41,609
company<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting a communication plan out</font>

1507
00:47:40,019 --> 00:47:43,828
what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> found is that as soon as I</font>

1508
00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:45,749
invested in education awareness things

1509
00:47:43,829 --> 00:47:47,729
actually got better like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> could do</font>

1510
00:47:45,749 --> 00:47:49,109
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy stuff like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rehal our entire</font>

1511
00:47:47,729 --> 00:47:50,098
network in like a week which would

1512
00:47:49,109 --> 00:47:51,749
normally take a normal company like a

1513
00:47:50,099 --> 00:47:53,039
year to do you know i'm talking like

1514
00:47:51,749 --> 00:47:54,598
production<font color="#E5E5E5"> changes like hey we're gonna</font>

1515
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:55,769
go to risk any queers going to up it to

1516
00:47:54,599 --> 00:47:56,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">ten characters today ten character</font>

1517
00:47:55,769 --> 00:47:58,709
password today across the whole company

1518
00:47:56,910 --> 00:48:00,209
see what happens you know and obviously

1519
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:01,348
we went to change control and all that

1520
00:48:00,209 --> 00:48:03,089
our stuff i don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really like you know</font>

1521
00:48:01,349 --> 00:48:05,849
get in trouble<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a change control</font>

1522
00:48:03,089 --> 00:48:08,459
people but but literally you get stuff

1523
00:48:05,849 --> 00:48:09,869
that works really fast and so if you

1524
00:48:08,459 --> 00:48:11,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at building a program the first</font>

1525
00:48:09,869 --> 00:48:12,869
step is is selling the program to

1526
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:14,698
executive committee<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean by far you</font>

1527
00:48:12,869 --> 00:48:16,529
need your people to buy off on<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and</font>

1528
00:48:14,699 --> 00:48:17,759
right now we have such a valuable time

1529
00:48:16,529 --> 00:48:18,989
right now to do this everybody's

1530
00:48:17,759 --> 00:48:20,579
freaking out about heartbleed and then

1531
00:48:18,989 --> 00:48:22,529
the week after not easier they came<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

1532
00:48:20,579 --> 00:48:23,880
like everybody's come by I had a buddy

1533
00:48:22,529 --> 00:48:25,109
that was the first time presenting to

1534
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:27,089
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Board of Directors in his company</font>

1535
00:48:25,109 --> 00:48:28,589
for security and the guy interrupted

1536
00:48:27,089 --> 00:48:29,640
them and said hey we're not doing enough

1537
00:48:28,589 --> 00:48:32,160
in security what do you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1538
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:33,538
successful he's like okay I<font color="#E5E5E5"> need some</font>

1539
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,459
people I<font color="#E5E5E5"> need this and he's this is this</font>

1540
00:48:33,539 --> 00:48:37,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is like you got it we're not</font>
