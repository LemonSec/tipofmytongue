1
00:00:01,569 --> 00:00:07,809
right now we have Jeremy Gold sign who

2
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:09,400
will be talking on IOT and the future of

3
00:00:07,809 --> 00:00:11,520
pen testing so let's welcome him to the

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,520
stage

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,900
all right well first I just want to

6
00:00:17,619 --> 00:00:22,240
thank everyone for coming along to the

7
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:25,119
talk hopefully we'll be able to take

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,919
something away from it so of course

9
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,240
based on the title here I'm going to be

10
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,670
talking about the Internet of Things and

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,339
how that plays into the future of pen

12
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:35,679
testing and the security implications so

13
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,569
let's start off with a an agenda as to

14
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:39,159
what will be going over here of course

15
00:00:37,569 --> 00:00:42,339
we have to have the obligatory Who am I

16
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:44,979
so you all know who I am then we'll get

17
00:00:42,339 --> 00:00:47,019
into the the background of Technology

18
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:49,449
evolution and how that's affected pen

19
00:00:47,019 --> 00:00:52,358
testing so a bit of a you know history

20
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:55,599
of computing so to speak then we'll look

21
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:58,269
at where we're heading from now in the

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,219
kind of short term medium term and then

23
00:00:58,269 --> 00:01:02,019
take a bit of a deep dive into IOT and

24
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:04,059
hardware hacking of course which should

25
00:01:02,019 --> 00:01:07,390
be the fun part and then we'll take a

26
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:09,340
bit of a big step back and discuss why

27
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:11,530
this kind of matters at a high level to

28
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:15,070
us you know to society to our industry

29
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:17,470
and some concluding thoughts as well so

30
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:20,169
we're getting to our bigotry Who am I

31
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:21,880
so you know said I'm Jeremy Goldstein

32
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:24,940
I'm the head of security testing at TSS

33
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:27,250
TSS was formerly datacom TSS we've

34
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:28,840
rebranded TSS cyber and we provide

35
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:31,090
managed security services security

36
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:34,110
consultancy and red teaming interesting

37
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:36,490
which is what I'm I lead a team for

38
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,530
previous to that I was the team lead of

39
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:41,199
the KP and red team which is effectively

40
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:43,000
Telstra in the Netherlands where I lived

41
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,380
and worked for three years and before

42
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,060
that I was the director of security

43
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:49,360
testing in the tax office who I'm sure

44
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:50,800
everyone is somewhat familiar with I've

45
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,600
been an info sector about 15 years

46
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,130
running technical teams for about 10 of

47
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,960
those and you know all focused around

48
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:58,600
contesting instant response threat

49
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:01,449
intelligence so let's go through a bit

50
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,130
of a a selective history of modern

51
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:06,070
computing and how it's actually impacted

52
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:09,728
interesting so I'm gonna start with the

53
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:11,799
you know the humble PC as a lot of

54
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:13,830
you'll probably know PC started as in

55
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:15,780
like homebrew Computer Club

56
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:19,140
you know over in America this is a photo

57
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:22,440
of Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs working

58
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,940
on some of the original pcs and they

59
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,040
really started out in these enthusiasts

60
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,540
type of clubs and what kind of kid

61
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:32,030
computers he'd put together in that kind

62
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:35,670
of thing but later on with people like

63
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:37,350
beautiful Bill Gates here they started

64
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:39,450
to gain traction in businesses and there

65
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:42,030
were no longer this hobbyist you know

66
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:45,329
like device that you'd put together and

67
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:48,060
so you had marketing like that and then

68
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:49,350
Steve Ballmer and with that kind of

69
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,540
thing it's like how could business does

70
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:54,930
not grab these these computers up and

71
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:56,970
and use them so looking at what that

72
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,740
kind of brought us you know with PCs

73
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,540
becoming pervasive in businesses

74
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,680
enterprises that kind of thing you know

75
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,540
that brought about a lot of desktop

76
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,880
applications that that everyone would

77
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,410
use to do their jobs and from a pen

78
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,240
testing perspective this brought us you

79
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:12,180
know thick client pen testing

80
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:16,290
you know I'd alley debug that kind of

81
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:19,140
thing after you know PC started become a

82
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:22,799
bit more pervasive networking started to

83
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:24,750
to you know rear its head to actually

84
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,239
connect these computers together and the

85
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:28,890
Internet of course and kind of you know

86
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:30,000
you'll see a similar theme here at least

87
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:32,399
with the way I see it is that the

88
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,950
internet also started out a bit less

89
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,690
commercial was largely like academic

90
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:39,690
quite casual you know bulletin board

91
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:42,030
systems that kind of thing and and

92
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:43,440
military as well and it wasn't till you

93
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:45,690
know much later that businesses and

94
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:49,140
enterprises started to you know started

95
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:50,940
to adopt you know the internet and you

96
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,410
know that that networking that internet

97
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,600
that really brought us infrastructure up

98
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:55,799
interesting so you know there's some

99
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,880
there's some pretty common tools there

100
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:00,330
that a lot of you would be very familiar

101
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,769
with from the internet you know moving

102
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:04,920
on from bulletin board systems and those

103
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:07,650
kind of things we had websites and web

104
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:10,559
applications and again they started out

105
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:13,230
very very casual and consumer oriented

106
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,048
so some of you might recognize some of

107
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:18,539
these style of Geocities web pages which

108
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:20,608
were all the hotness back in the day and

109
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,540
you know there was of course pornography

110
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:23,159
and

111
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,810
you know those kind of bits and pieces

112
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,820
on the internet but businesses didn't

113
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:29,100
really adopt it until it became way more

114
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,750
pervasive and now I think you'd all

115
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,940
agree that it's it's pretty rare for a

116
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:36,210
company or a business not to have some

117
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:38,730
kind of internet presence and so you

118
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:39,989
know these rise of web apps websites

119
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:42,540
that kind of thing brought us web

120
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:43,920
application pen testing which you know

121
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:47,250
most people are pretty pretty familiar

122
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,960
with the next major iteration iteration

123
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:52,380
that I saw was the rise of smartphones

124
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:55,710
and apps but again we had this really

125
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:57,810
consumer slant to them so I remember

126
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:59,880
buying my first iPhone the only iPhone

127
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:01,530
ever bought as well by the way and the

128
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,000
key selling point when it first got

129
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:05,700
released was that I no longer had to

130
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,950
have an iPod and a phone it was one one

131
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:10,260
device and that was that was the really

132
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:12,900
cool kind of I guess you know consumer

133
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:14,370
slant to this device because the App

134
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,799
Store didn't exist it wasn't invented

135
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:20,520
yet when when the first iPhone was

136
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,500
released but of course you know the App

137
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,450
Store did get released Android did their

138
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,880
version and then apps you know just

139
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:29,210
became so pervasive but again these apps

140
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,100
had a very consumer slant to start with

141
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:35,549
the App Store was released in 2008 and

142
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:37,470
by Christmas 2008 the number one paid

143
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:39,840
for app on the App Store was a far tap

144
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:42,420
the tree press a button and it farts and

145
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:45,210
I read that apparently the author of

146
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:48,330
this fada made up to $10,000 in a day on

147
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:51,479
at times through sales of it so it just

148
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:52,560
goes to show how consumer apps work but

149
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,700
now of course you know you do your

150
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,380
banking on your phone and you know

151
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,550
two-factor authentication tokens all

152
00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:00,270
sorts of business productivity

153
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:03,540
enterprise type apps and that has

154
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:05,460
brought us mobile app in testing next

155
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:08,010
major major iteration you know the

156
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,810
almighty cloud this is a little bit

157
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:12,150
different but I still really see it as a

158
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:13,950
consumer slant to start with from what I

159
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:16,109
saw the the early adopters of the cloud

160
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:18,150
were really your consumer facing apps

161
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:20,730
you know Instagram Dropbox that kind of

162
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:21,960
thing and it wasn't till later that you

163
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:23,550
know your government's your businesses

164
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,370
your enterprises started adopting cloud

165
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,870
and similar they now it's unusual when

166
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:29,220
you're assessing a system in some way

167
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:31,580
shape or form that I won't have at least

168
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:34,640
some component in the cloud or maybe

169
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:36,380
cloud-first and everything's there and

170
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,669
I'm sure some pen testers in the

171
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:39,890
audience can attest to this when you're

172
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:41,360
assessing a cloud environment it means

173
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:43,460
you go to floors cloud and floors to

174
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,170
cloud now and read through them to make

175
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,820
sure that you actually remember all the

176
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:50,210
different miss configurations and things

177
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:52,849
you need to check out for so we've had

178
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:54,680
this brief brief history of where where

179
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,970
we've come from from a penetration

180
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,470
testing perspective you know web

181
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:59,810
applications are generally the lion's

182
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:02,240
share infrastructure of course is there

183
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:03,620
external and internal mobile apps and

184
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,350
the cloud is really involved in almost

185
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,970
everything that we do these days but

186
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:12,640
let's now have a look at where we're

187
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:15,050
heading so really I see two major trends

188
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:17,810
and I'm talking you know as I mentioned

189
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:19,190
the kind of shorter to medium term you

190
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:21,320
know we had the excellent keynote on day

191
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:24,469
one about quantum computing and you know

192
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,969
how that is coming but I'm talking more

193
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:27,410
in the kind of shorter term than that

194
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:29,150
and what we're gonna be seeing in the

195
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:30,650
next months and years from the

196
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:32,630
perspective of you know security analyst

197
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:34,130
pen testers that kind of thing and

198
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,960
there's really two main trends that I

199
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:37,310
see in that is cloud computing

200
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,599
continuing and of course obviously the

201
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:40,250
talks about the Internet of Things the

202
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,830
Internet of Things

203
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:44,360
so before we you know move into more of

204
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:46,729
the details the Internet of Things I'll

205
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,590
briefly touch on cloud computing you

206
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:51,650
know which everyone is fairly familiar

207
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:53,719
with but there's some I guess you know

208
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:55,280
changes that are going there with the

209
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,520
abstraction away from traditional

210
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:02,000
computing that impact us as pen testers

211
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:03,500
and security security people and I think

212
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,760
like lambda you know serverless

213
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,280
functions that kind of thing are a

214
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:08,930
really clean example of that where you

215
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,059
no longer have kind of almost any of

216
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:13,030
that stack below it you're just running

217
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:15,080
code you know in the cloud and that's it

218
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:17,510
and there's been some really good talks

219
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:20,359
and research in in recent years on

220
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:22,430
assessing or year maybe on assessing

221
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,170
those those types of solutions so you

222
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:26,300
know we're not going to go into that at

223
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:28,010
all but one of the key points that I

224
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:30,410
have with with this evolution of cloud

225
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:32,150
and how to fix us as security Assessors

226
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:34,040
pen testers that kind of thing is I

227
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:36,409
really see it as that kind of continuous

228
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:37,880
education and improvement and just kind

229
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:38,990
of staying ahead of the curve and you

230
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,429
know understanding how to test for

231
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,690
lambda function and you know reading up

232
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:44,489
on it and then going and doing it using

233
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:48,339
those existing skill sets that you have

234
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:52,000
but IOT on the other hand I think is

235
00:08:48,339 --> 00:08:55,720
different so at the moment you know IOT

236
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,029
is immature to me it feels like we're

237
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:00,339
apps were when the fart app was the big

238
00:08:58,029 --> 00:09:03,399
app of the year

239
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:06,839
it's full of fail so here's an article

240
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:10,000
about a smart security app that crashed

241
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:13,330
and it caused the customers to be locked

242
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,640
inside and outside of their homes and

243
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:16,899
you know there are plenty more examples

244
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,399
this one also I thought was quite

245
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:21,520
entertaining it was a smart heater that

246
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,230
failed off when the server's went down

247
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,819
so it was then you had people all over

248
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,350
Twitter complaining about the fact that

249
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:29,830
their homes are freezing because some

250
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:31,750
back-end servers were not operating and

251
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:33,459
you know a special shout-out to Internet

252
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,930
of a Twitter account because it's

253
00:09:33,459 --> 00:09:38,649
full of this kind of thing and it's it's

254
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:40,479
it's worth a worth a scroll through but

255
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:42,279
this is going to change

256
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,890
Forbes here is pretty clear on what

257
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:46,180
they're trying to say you know IOT is

258
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:47,620
going to become making its way into

259
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:50,170
enterprises it's gonna start being

260
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:52,440
adopted more you know forget about the

261
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:55,660
number but it's a clear signal I think

262
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:58,510
and another example a little a little

263
00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:01,240
closer to home this is actually I

264
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:02,980
thought this kind of well I was able to

265
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:06,040
extrapolate out my point very well out

266
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:09,610
of this so the the article on the left

267
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:11,589
is actually a an article that was placed

268
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:14,410
on November 30 so about three and a half

269
00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:16,720
months ago it's in the technology and

270
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:20,439
innovation IOT section of this Telstra

271
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,000
exchange blog I think it is then only a

272
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,140
couple of weeks ago I found this one on

273
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,880
the right

274
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:27,970
you know same kind of topic talking

275
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,290
about IOT adoption at Telstra but what I

276
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:31,660
thought was interesting is it's actually

277
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:33,760
in the business and enterprise section

278
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:35,380
of their blog so I thought it just made

279
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,420
that nice transition showing how things

280
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:40,540
go from consumer land into business and

281
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:42,610
enterprise land and you know based on

282
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:44,170
these trends that that I've discussed so

283
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:46,270
far and given IO T's current trajectory

284
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:47,949
I believe it's only a matter of time

285
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,540
until it makes its way into businesses

286
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:51,310
and enterprises in a meaningful way and

287
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:53,110
I was hoping to find someone more

288
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:54,400
important than I who had said something

289
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:56,740
similar to that but I couldn't find it

290
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,920
so I'm quoting myself

291
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:01,930
don't know if you're allowed to do that

292
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:04,959
alright so up until now we've really

293
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:07,540
just laid the foundation of of why you

294
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:09,040
know I see IT adoption increasing and

295
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:12,579
that we will actually make its way into

296
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:14,770
enterprises and we'll start seeing it so

297
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:16,149
you know what's the big deal about IOT

298
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:18,310
pen testing I mean it's already being

299
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:19,779
done people do it but what's the big

300
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:21,310
deal about it becoming more common why

301
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,720
is it any more important than any other

302
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:25,390
buzzword that we have around you know

303
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,850
big data AI ml data lakes whatever you

304
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:30,189
want to call them and for me there's

305
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:33,070
there's one word that the differentiates

306
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:36,730
IOT traduced to traditional solutions

307
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:38,980
and that's hardware hardware presents a

308
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:41,649
whole new world for pen testers and

309
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:43,660
whole new playground as well it has a

310
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:45,399
different threat model attack surface

311
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:47,380
you need different technical and even

312
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:48,580
physical skills when you're soldiering

313
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:51,610
and things like that which I've been

314
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:53,290
traditionally terrible at and so this is

315
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:55,240
this is a real change and it will change

316
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:56,620
of direction from from all of us who

317
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,920
just play in the software world most of

318
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:03,970
the time and to to go on a small little

319
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:07,150
anecdote when I moved to Amsterdam in

320
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:09,520
2015 to run the KP and red team there

321
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:12,760
I had never touched Hardware before in

322
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:14,050
this way and I got there and there are a

323
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,000
lot of guys in the team that really

324
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:18,130
enthusiastic about hardware hacking and

325
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,320
I just didn't get it they'd show me

326
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:22,570
getting like a you are a serial shell on

327
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,770
a router and you know root shell and I'd

328
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:25,930
kind of thing get that it's cool but

329
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:27,040
what can you do with it you know isn't

330
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:29,979
it more effective if you're able to

331
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,630
access the web interface or whatever and

332
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:35,020
it wasn't until I started seeing them

333
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:37,360
actually you know going and extracting

334
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:39,640
firmware off those devices and finding

335
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,839
buffer overflow exploits on services

336
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,029
running on the devices because they can

337
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:44,650
actually analyze the code or getting

338
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:47,110
credentials out of the devices through

339
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:49,660
hardware hacking techniques or even

340
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:51,790
finding getting the web source code off

341
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:53,620
the web interface off them and finding

342
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:55,209
like remote command injection as route

343
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:56,740
on these web interfaces because they

344
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:58,810
were using Hardware techniques and

345
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:00,610
that's what started to really turn me

346
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:03,750
around and I started to see the value in

347
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:08,020
in testing these solutions in that way

348
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:09,470
so you know all of that really sets up

349
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:11,750
my premise about hardware

350
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:14,990
and you know testing IT solutions being

351
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:16,910
part of our our InfoSec future so let's

352
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:19,100
let's start to move into you know what I

353
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:22,400
call the fun part and talk about IOT and

354
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:24,740
hardware hacking but you know first a

355
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:27,140
couple of little housekeeping items that

356
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:29,780
I think are quite important what we're

357
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:32,060
discussing here and going through is IOT

358
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:34,010
and hardware solution and testing and

359
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:36,020
that's a key differentiator I want to

360
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:38,569
you'll hear me mention a lot of times

361
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:41,000
because when you have this shiny device

362
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:42,890
this IOT device or sensor or whatever it

363
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,560
is it should really be part of a

364
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:46,670
solution it should achieve something it

365
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,930
shouldn't just be a shiny piece of

366
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:50,120
hardware that for the sake of it and

367
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:52,370
when you're you know say a pen gesture

368
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,350
you should be assessing this as a whole

369
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:56,120
solution and how it actually interacts

370
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:57,530
in an ecosystem and what it achieves for

371
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:01,370
there for the business or whoever you're

372
00:13:57,530 --> 00:14:03,170
testing for another key point is that

373
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:05,840
it's not it's not hardware hacking

374
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:08,180
research that I'm talking about here so

375
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,980
this was a point that you know as you

376
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,900
saw in my Bible I've been pen testing

377
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:13,850
for a lot of years but it took me a lot

378
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:15,890
of years to realize the difference

379
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:18,200
between security researchers and pen

380
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:20,390
testers because I feel like with the

381
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,280
mandatory impostor syndrome that we all

382
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:24,530
we all get to wear and carry with us

383
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:27,260
you'll see someone like a Charlie Miller

384
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:28,490
hacker Jeep or something like that and

385
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,689
then you think about your pen test that

386
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:31,100
you're doing day to day and you feel

387
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:33,200
like well I couldn't do that on my

388
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:34,580
two-week engagement and you know I

389
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,320
certainly found it was lost on me the

390
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:39,950
fact that there's months and months of

391
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,990
research spent on single point solutions

392
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:43,280
in order to discover these amazing

393
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:46,130
vulnerabilities that help move the

394
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:48,040
industry forward so you know similar

395
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:50,660
there's some amazing hardware hacking

396
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,219
things that can be done but I won't be

397
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:54,770
discussing those I'll be talking about

398
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:57,200
really you know what you can actually

399
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:59,300
reasonably achieve within the norm time

400
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:04,760
and budget constraints that you have as

401
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:06,859
a as a pin tester so I also want to talk

402
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:09,589
about what a hardware pin test isn't and

403
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:11,180
highlight a few pieces so I did our

404
00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:13,250
sylvio if I could put this up and he

405
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:15,560
said yes so that's okay but this is

406
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:17,600
besides organizer Sylvio

407
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:20,119
this is a YouTube video where he's using

408
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,680
dangerous dangerous chemicals to try and

409
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:25,189
D Kappa chip in his own

410
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,899
I believe and that's really cool and

411
00:15:25,189 --> 00:15:29,449
that's a genuine attack against hardware

412
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:31,670
because you can you can D cap a chip and

413
00:15:29,449 --> 00:15:34,309
take off all the teeny-tiny layers using

414
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:36,469
crazy chemicals or lasers or focused ion

415
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:38,379
beams whatever they are and then you can

416
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:41,119
actually zoom in and see the circuitry

417
00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:42,860
using like a crazy microscope or

418
00:15:41,119 --> 00:15:44,540
something and start to reverse-engineer

419
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:47,269
the actual physical connections on a

420
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:48,740
tiny integrated circuit but doing these

421
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:51,170
kind of attacks effectively can take

422
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:54,559
months and months of time and there's a

423
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:56,389
very good French Research Olivier Thomas

424
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:58,699
who does this kind of work has a company

425
00:15:56,389 --> 00:16:00,470
that does it and I saw a presentation

426
00:15:58,699 --> 00:16:01,910
from him last year where he talked about

427
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:03,740
how much the price is coming down on

428
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:05,059
this but you know it's coming down from

429
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,980
millions of dollars to hundreds of

430
00:16:05,059 --> 00:16:09,350
thousands of dollars and the time frames

431
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:10,399
are coming down from a year to months it

432
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,720
still it's not gonna be an effective

433
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,399
attack when you know you've got a whole

434
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:17,660
solution to assess in a couple of weeks

435
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:20,389
or something like that so with that out

436
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:22,368
of the way we're talking about what a

437
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:24,559
hardware pen test is I'm gonna be going

438
00:16:22,369 --> 00:16:26,170
through two real-world examples a

439
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:29,839
personal safety device and an

440
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:30,920
electrocardiogram test solution so for

441
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,749
those of you who don't know because I

442
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:35,949
certainly didn't and forgot many times

443
00:16:32,749 --> 00:16:38,509
while testing as well an ECG is a

444
00:16:35,949 --> 00:16:41,179
basically a heart test that you do with

445
00:16:38,509 --> 00:16:43,009
sensors on your heart to detect if you

446
00:16:41,179 --> 00:16:46,519
have potential problems that your

447
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:48,199
physician may need to address but anyway

448
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:49,639
we'll be going through these two to

449
00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:52,370
real-world examples focusing primarily

450
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:55,189
on the personal safety device these are

451
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:59,149
two penetration tests that I was was

452
00:16:55,189 --> 00:17:01,160
part of so they were real real tests and

453
00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:02,179
I also just want to kind of point out

454
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,709
that you know I'll be going through

455
00:17:02,179 --> 00:17:05,510
these examples again what you can

456
00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:07,039
reasonably do it's not of course a

457
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:09,020
training course in this timeframe so it

458
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:12,379
won't be every possible attack vector

459
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:14,658
and that kind of thing so let's start

460
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:16,579
with the personal safety device which is

461
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:18,409
one of these they're a white label

462
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:20,329
solution you can get them off Aliexpress

463
00:17:18,409 --> 00:17:22,939
there's retailers in Australia that have

464
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:25,188
them all around the world basically the

465
00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:26,899
premise is that for elderly you know

466
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:29,990
at-risk individuals people who are doing

467
00:17:26,898 --> 00:17:33,049
outdoor extreme sports people traveling

468
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:35,029
that kind of thing you can use this to

469
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:35,270
effectively press the SOS button and

470
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:38,420
it'll

471
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:41,420
send your location and you know the SOS

472
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:44,870
message to your contacts that you've

473
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:47,000
mentioned or listed and it will also

474
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:48,409
initiate a phone call on your behalf to

475
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,510
them as well if needed

476
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:52,130
it also has full detection which I

477
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:54,260
believe the idea is if you're an elderly

478
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:55,910
person and you fall over and don't get

479
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,200
up again that the device should then

480
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:59,630
alert your emergency contacts that

481
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,580
something's probably gone wrong and it

482
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:03,470
can also be used for geofencing which to

483
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:06,199
me seemed a little more more creepy but

484
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:08,050
wasn't part of this solution but you

485
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,310
know there's that word again solution so

486
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:11,570
you know we need to assess this as part

487
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:15,440
of a solution it's not just a little

488
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:17,629
device and you know in order to kind of

489
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,690
you know visualize this solution I

490
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:22,880
thought I'd draw a very slick high-end

491
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:25,040
diagram for you it's definitely not done

492
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,540
in paintbrush so everyone can actually

493
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:28,220
see and understand what what we're

494
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:29,810
talking about and kind of use it to help

495
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:31,820
I guess threat model and visualize what

496
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:33,530
we're what we're looking at so we have a

497
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:35,929
user in the kind of middle bottom there

498
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:37,820
they they have the SOS device on them

499
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:39,440
they also have a companion app in both

500
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:41,870
Android and iOS that was part of the

501
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,240
solution to be tested there's a web

502
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:46,100
server they can log in to a website and

503
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,810
also set their contacts that way the

504
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:51,199
mobile app talks to the web server and

505
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:52,820
the device itself apparently talked to

506
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,700
some cloud somewhere that we had no idea

507
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:57,710
anything about but we'll work from there

508
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:59,180
and that you know cloud somewhere would

509
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:01,070
alert the friend you know the happy

510
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:04,850
friend that you know they need to help

511
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:06,139
or anything like that so when we started

512
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:07,820
testing this solution we actually

513
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:09,200
started looking at the Android app the

514
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:10,340
web site you know those kind of

515
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,900
components because they're obviously

516
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:13,850
important and we thought they'd be the

517
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,350
easy win as well but there was really

518
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:16,969
nothing interesting so the Android app

519
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:19,219
nothing website pretty much nothing

520
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:21,620
calms nothing of interest that cloud

521
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,700
somewhere no idea where it was so you

522
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,979
know that's nice because we're here to

523
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:27,830
talk about hardware so we get to jump

524
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:28,940
into the hardware device now so one of

525
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:31,610
the first things when you're analyzing

526
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:33,230
you know a piece of hardware is you want

527
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:34,520
to analyze the attack service you want

528
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:36,440
to understand what functionality that

529
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,760
device actually has does it have Wi-Fi

530
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,770
does it every Ethernet does it have an

531
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,870
SD card you know all of those kind of

532
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:43,629
things because that'll really influence

533
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:45,800
what kind of testing you'll actually do

534
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:47,330
you know if it's got Wi-Fi you'll

535
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,080
probably hook it up to your access point

536
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:51,080
and try

537
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:53,139
view the traffic if it's got USB you'll

538
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,340
probably look at USB are into the tax

539
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:58,309
you know you can get this information

540
00:19:55,340 --> 00:20:00,439
from from the manual from marketing

541
00:19:58,309 --> 00:20:01,879
material data sheets it's normally

542
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,169
readily available because of course the

543
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,730
someone's normally trying to sell a

544
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:07,640
product and they want to speak to the

545
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:09,440
benefits of it so you know as I said

546
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:12,980
we'll be running through our example

547
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:15,320
here so with our SOS device analyzing

548
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:17,990
the functionality it had had a 3G you

549
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:20,600
know GSM module on it had GPS of course

550
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:22,010
for location had a microUSB port had

551
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,139
some charging ports at the bottom which

552
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:26,750
were just charging pins for a cradle and

553
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:29,689
an accelerometer to do do the fault

554
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:32,480
detection basically that's good we know

555
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:34,190
that about it the next thing really

556
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,220
wants to kind of understand what your

557
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:39,769
device does is to try the easy stuff

558
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:40,940
first so even though you're looking at a

559
00:20:39,769 --> 00:20:42,950
bit of hardware it doesn't mean you have

560
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:46,130
to do invasive level attacks straight

561
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:47,570
away you might be able to just remove

562
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:49,220
the SD card out of it stick it in your

563
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:51,379
computer and have full access to the

564
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:52,519
root filesystem and passwords you should

565
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:55,039
try to tell that to it with default

566
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:56,330
credentials you know Moriah botnet

567
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,309
certainly prove that that can be pretty

568
00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:00,139
effective so there's a whole bunch of

569
00:20:58,309 --> 00:21:03,529
simple things that you want to try the

570
00:21:00,139 --> 00:21:07,309
for actually going deep especially on a

571
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:09,019
pen test so for our device you know

572
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:10,850
three G's a bit complicated we'll get to

573
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:13,100
that later GPS not that interesting

574
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:15,469
accelerometer very uninteresting the

575
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:18,649
microUSB port really was the only kind

576
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:21,289
of easy easy access for us but it turned

577
00:21:18,649 --> 00:21:24,049
out to just be charging so we had no

578
00:21:21,289 --> 00:21:25,820
easy roads basically so once we've gone

579
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:28,279
through that we're going to open up the

580
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:29,750
device and actually look inside it so to

581
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:32,120
do this you want you know screwdrivers

582
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:33,679
sharp tools things like that to be able

583
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,059
to actually crack open a device and get

584
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,590
into it and it can be difficult

585
00:21:35,059 --> 00:21:38,809
sometimes other times it can be very

586
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:41,750
easy you want to be wary of tamper

587
00:21:38,809 --> 00:21:46,668
switches as well here which can can bite

588
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:47,779
you so we there we're service device it

589
00:21:46,669 --> 00:21:49,399
was actually designed to be unscrewed

590
00:21:47,779 --> 00:21:50,690
which was really nice because you had to

591
00:21:49,399 --> 00:21:53,479
put a sim card in it so that made it

592
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:54,889
really easy and when I pulled it apart

593
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,240
and started looking at it I was also

594
00:21:54,889 --> 00:21:58,610
happy to see it didn't have a tamper

595
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,790
switch at all and we tested and retested

596
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:01,530
and

597
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:03,210
you know we're trying to assess it and

598
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:05,370
after a while I was realizing that one

599
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:07,680
particular portion of it wasn't working

600
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:09,750
right just wasn't phoning home at all

601
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:11,820
and I was asking my colleague if he was

602
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:13,050
having these problems and he said no and

603
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:15,510
then he asked me have you got the tamper

604
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:17,850
switch now I said there's no tamper

605
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:19,770
switch on this and he said no see that

606
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:21,540
very obvious button right there if you

607
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:23,610
push it down the tamper detection goes

608
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:25,139
off so I'm very embarrassed leave and

609
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:26,280
leave them went back and pushed the

610
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:28,380
button down and everything worked

611
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:30,120
perfectly so it is really important to

612
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,980
take a check for those those tamper

613
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:34,110
detection

614
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:35,460
once you you know got it open and

615
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:36,959
operating and that kind of thing you

616
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:39,450
want to identify you know what's on the

617
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,590
board there what are the chips how do

618
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:41,880
they communicate with each other what

619
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:44,189
are the lines look like are there any

620
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,840
debug ports there but probably the most

621
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:47,850
important step in here is reading data

622
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,050
sheets so I personally bricked multiple

623
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:51,179
devices because I haven't paid enough

624
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:52,740
attention to the data sheets and what

625
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:56,820
different pins are and different chips

626
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:59,180
are and that kind of thing but it is

627
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:01,919
really important to actually read them

628
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:05,400
so with our example this is the actual

629
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:09,480
board highlighted in green there is an

630
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:12,420
arm stm32 processor in red is like a

631
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:16,980
flash EEPROM style storage chip

632
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:18,930
basically and and no real debug ports

633
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:20,580
were found there you'd also probably can

634
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,810
see that where the SIM card clearly goes

635
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:24,750
and on the other side of the board is

636
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:27,929
the baseband chip with a bit of a copper

637
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:30,480
on it but yeah no real debug ports which

638
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:32,790
was gonna be one of our first first goes

639
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,110
at it some people with a keen eye might

640
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:36,060
be able to see that there's some JTAG

641
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:40,260
looking ports maybe some newer ones that

642
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:42,450
had just exposed pads but in our testing

643
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:43,710
we just found they were not not working

644
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:45,840
at all and maybe it should have been

645
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:47,730
removed or something but I do want to

646
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,320
have a quick tangent on debug ports

647
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:51,960
because they can often be one of the

648
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:54,389
first avenues of attack on a hardware

649
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:57,420
device so because that last twice didn't

650
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:59,280
have any obvious debug ports I went to

651
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:02,190
my garage and found a 3g router I had

652
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:04,290
lying around opened it up and lo and

653
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:05,820
behold as is highlighted on the picture

654
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:07,620
there there's two ports that look very

655
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:09,870
much like you are and one that looks

656
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:11,250
very much like JTAG so I wanted to kind

657
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:12,418
of demonstrate what they can look like

658
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:14,940
but there is no stand

659
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:16,440
for them so you know it's just

660
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:19,350
indicative but you kind of want to look

661
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,580
for things that look a bit like it once

662
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:22,199
you've found it things like the

663
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:23,668
venerable multimeter will help you

664
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,989
actually assess what what whether

665
00:24:23,669 --> 00:24:27,600
they're live whether they're power

666
00:24:24,989 --> 00:24:30,029
whether they're ground that kind of

667
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,889
thing if it's JTAG something like a

668
00:24:30,029 --> 00:24:34,769
jtagulator can help you interact with it

669
00:24:31,889 --> 00:24:37,379
you are you might just have a USB to TTL

670
00:24:34,769 --> 00:24:38,580
like a USB serial adapter but I also

671
00:24:37,379 --> 00:24:41,480
under action do a special mention to

672
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:45,359
last year's b-sides badge the bus side

673
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:47,340
which is actually a serial okay you add

674
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:50,009
adapter and it also does JTAG detection

675
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:51,359
as well so I thought that was really

676
00:24:50,009 --> 00:24:52,769
cool that I actually got a badge last

677
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:57,210
year that I can actually use on

678
00:24:52,769 --> 00:24:59,279
engagements now but I also want to point

679
00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:02,070
out that just like in traditional pen

680
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:04,590
testing creativity can really help so

681
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:07,980
those you know you art and JTAG ports

682
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:09,959
ports I pointed out are effectively most

683
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:11,879
of the time just basically a pin out

684
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:15,090
that comes out and is traceable on the

685
00:25:11,879 --> 00:25:16,619
board to the actual processor itself so

686
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:19,168
what this this person is actually done

687
00:25:16,619 --> 00:25:21,238
is used some some very fine handiwork

688
00:25:19,169 --> 00:25:23,730
and some micro soldiering techniques to

689
00:25:21,239 --> 00:25:26,100
solder directly to the pins on the

690
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:28,169
processor that happened to be JTAG

691
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:29,248
because he's read the datasheet and then

692
00:25:28,169 --> 00:25:32,070
he's able to interact with it directly

693
00:25:29,249 --> 00:25:34,559
even though there's no JTAG pronounced

694
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:37,259
on the board and we'll see a little bit

695
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:38,549
more of that later on - so now that

696
00:25:37,259 --> 00:25:40,409
we've had a quick quick diversion under

697
00:25:38,549 --> 00:25:42,210
debug ports I wanted to have a little

698
00:25:40,409 --> 00:25:43,499
review on where we're at and and start

699
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:45,539
to kind of hone in on attacking this

700
00:25:43,499 --> 00:25:47,639
device because we've got a bit of an

701
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:49,289
idea of what the device is functionality

702
00:25:47,639 --> 00:25:51,539
in components you know inputs and

703
00:25:49,289 --> 00:25:53,519
outputs the internals we've got a bit of

704
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:55,379
an idea on but we haven't really done

705
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:57,659
much yet so let's have a look at where

706
00:25:55,379 --> 00:26:00,539
we're at so going back to a very

707
00:25:57,659 --> 00:26:02,609
high-end diagram we've gotten rid of the

708
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:05,129
mobile app and the web server not much

709
00:26:02,609 --> 00:26:06,269
there you know we started looking the

710
00:26:05,129 --> 00:26:08,158
device but we don't know what the

711
00:26:06,269 --> 00:26:09,659
firmware looks like on it we don't know

712
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,149
if there's any sensitive data stored on

713
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:13,799
it either and that some cloud somewhere

714
00:26:12,149 --> 00:26:16,199
we have no idea about yet we haven't

715
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:17,789
seen how this device talks to it so that

716
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,669
whole communication streams is still

717
00:26:17,789 --> 00:26:21,840
very unknown so with a bit of a kind of

718
00:26:20,669 --> 00:26:23,039
step back and looking at this we can

719
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,418
kind of threat model it a bit and

720
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,110
actually work out what do we really want

721
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:28,759
to attack

722
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:31,158
and we have to two main attacks that we

723
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:34,070
want to do at this stage and that is

724
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:35,960
extract that firmware off that chip that

725
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:37,820
we saw see if there's any sensitive data

726
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,230
see what the firmware does to try and

727
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:41,210
find other vulnerabilities in the

728
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:42,590
solution and also work out what that

729
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:45,620
communications is and where that

730
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:48,678
back-end cloud even is so let's let's go

731
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:50,479
through those attacks now the first one

732
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:52,039
extracting the firmware in data there's

733
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,840
a whole bunch of ways to do that

734
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:55,070
you know whatever works works often you

735
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,199
can just download it off the internet

736
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:58,730
you could probably all sometimes you can

737
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,440
just email the manufacturer and ask for

738
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:02,350
it you know using social engineering

739
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,220
techniques there's a whole bunch of ways

740
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:07,399
but for us a lot of them weren't

741
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:10,700
applicable so desoldering the chip was

742
00:27:07,399 --> 00:27:14,330
the the chosen solution for us so going

743
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:16,639
back to our board we can see here the

744
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:19,759
the flash chip highlighted it's got the

745
00:27:16,639 --> 00:27:22,100
the four kind of legs on each side which

746
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:23,299
are soldered to the board so you need to

747
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,289
get them off but you can't just use

748
00:27:23,299 --> 00:27:26,509
brute force because you'll probably

749
00:27:24,289 --> 00:27:27,919
break something so there's a few

750
00:27:26,509 --> 00:27:29,720
techniques to do this probably one of

751
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,149
the the neatest and easiest and quickest

752
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:35,179
is to use a rework station so on the

753
00:27:32,149 --> 00:27:35,389
left is a soldering iron and a hot-air

754
00:27:35,179 --> 00:27:37,059
gun

755
00:27:35,389 --> 00:27:39,469
commonly referred to as a rework station

756
00:27:37,059 --> 00:27:41,960
so the black handle on the left actually

757
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:43,700
has a tip at the end and it will blow

758
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:46,759
out hot air at you know three to four

759
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:48,769
hundred degrees Celsius and what you

760
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:52,100
effectively do is take that hot air put

761
00:27:48,769 --> 00:27:53,419
it over the the feet of the chip it'll

762
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:55,009
actually melt the solder and then you

763
00:27:53,419 --> 00:27:57,440
grab some tweezers and just pluck the

764
00:27:55,009 --> 00:27:59,240
chip right off so that's nice and easy

765
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,379
but then you've got a chip and you need

766
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,759
to read that chip and of course you

767
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:04,428
can't just stick it in a USB port

768
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:06,110
because that would do God knows what so

769
00:28:04,429 --> 00:28:08,269
you have a device programmer or a

770
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:09,949
universal programmer and that's what you

771
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:12,350
can actually use to have an individual

772
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:14,029
chip that's separated from a board you

773
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:15,469
effectively get that chip stick it in

774
00:28:14,029 --> 00:28:17,029
the appropriate adapter and then stick

775
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:18,889
it in a device programmer like that one

776
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:20,509
on the right plug it in to your computer

777
00:28:18,889 --> 00:28:23,240
and then hope that you can just do auto

778
00:28:20,509 --> 00:28:25,039
detect chip download flash contents and

779
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:27,230
at least in my experience luckily that's

780
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:29,090
almost always worked quite cleanly and

781
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:31,100
easily and if you've got an eight mega

782
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:32,750
ship and you go and use this technique

783
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:35,178
you'll have an eight megabyte binary

784
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:37,639
file sitting on your laptop which is

785
00:28:35,179 --> 00:28:38,930
great but then you need to analyze it

786
00:28:37,639 --> 00:28:40,729
and it might be encrypted as well

787
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:44,090
so you need to work that out for our

788
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:46,130
example luckily it wasn't encrypted it

789
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:48,770
was actually the firmware which means

790
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:50,450
you got to analyze this firmware now and

791
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:53,180
that's that's a whole discipline in and

792
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:55,580
of itself so what what we can see here

793
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:58,250
is actually a screenshot of of the

794
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:59,929
firmware in raid re so I mean some of

795
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:01,220
you may have noticed I am wearing a red

796
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:03,320
Irish shirt I'm a little bit of a

797
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:05,450
retiree fanboy I thought of replacing

798
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:08,120
this with Deidre you know given the hype

799
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:10,550
around it but I just couldn't do that

800
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:12,889
because in order to get this to work

801
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:14,240
when we did the engagement a colleague

802
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:17,390
of mine did the reverse engineering he

803
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:19,340
did it all in Ida Pro and then you know

804
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:21,230
being the Rideau a fanboy I am I thought

805
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:23,270
well I'm gonna do it in red arrow now

806
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:25,130
and I loaded in radar and it completely

807
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:28,639
failed not a single string no

808
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:30,440
cross-references nothing and I generally

809
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,600
take the approach of it's not radar it's

810
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:35,870
me it can do everything and I don't know

811
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:37,429
how to do it so I went very very far

812
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:38,810
down the rabbit hole and spent excessive

813
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:41,120
amounts of time trying to work out why

814
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:43,280
radar II couldn't analyze his firmware

815
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:45,409
to the point where I actually found that

816
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:47,840
radar his interpretation of a particular

817
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:50,120
arm instruction was incorrect and I

818
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,530
actually did a pull request and fixed

819
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:54,469
the code in red re so that it would

820
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:55,639
actually analyze the code correctly and

821
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:57,890
then it all worked from there so that

822
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:59,390
that was very much my like not so humble

823
00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:01,490
brag and the reason why I absolutely

824
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:03,650
must have a read re screenshot in here

825
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:07,640
and nothing else because it took a lot

826
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:10,850
of effort to get it there but you know

827
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:12,350
back to the firmware disassembly so we

828
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:13,610
analyzed the firmware to see you know

829
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:15,320
what are the end points where does it go

830
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:17,479
- is there any sensitive data there and

831
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:19,010
you know ultimately we only had a

832
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:21,410
limited time we couldn't find any end

833
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:23,030
points no IP addresses we understood now

834
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:25,370
that the firmware from the firmware that

835
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:26,710
only communicated over 3G so you know

836
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:29,330
that was going to be an important part

837
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:31,190
and it'll you know it all goes through

838
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:34,669
the baseband but still no endpoints that

839
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:36,740
we could see no sensitive data either so

840
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:38,270
we've effectively you know kind of tick

841
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:40,700
that off in a way we've learnt a bit

842
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:42,950
more still nothing very interesting no

843
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:45,710
no nice vulnerabilities dry it up except

844
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:47,690
unencrypted firmware so we really needed

845
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:50,300
to see these communications between the

846
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:51,410
device and the back end and there's a

847
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,940
couple of different ways you could do

848
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:54,650
that like obviously if there's Wi-Fi

849
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:58,550
you could do that but in this case we

850
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:59,090
had 3G so you can intercept 3G over the

851
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:01,340
airwaves

852
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:02,959
and another technique is what's called

853
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:04,520
bus snooping which we'll go into where

854
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,280
you actually intercept the the

855
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:09,050
communications on the board itself and

856
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:11,000
within 3G inception there's a couple of

857
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:12,980
different techniques that will we'll

858
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,570
quickly go over as well

859
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:17,330
but first the equipment if you want to

860
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:20,240
do a 3G interception which is illegal

861
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:22,310
and we'll go over that more so don't do

862
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,690
it you need to have a good quality SDR

863
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:25,820
but this goes for any other kind of

864
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:27,920
radio analysis of you know more

865
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:29,750
proprietary protocols so this is a

866
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:31,460
picture of us RP which is generally

867
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:33,560
considered to be one of the best best

868
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:35,300
SDR there are and when you're doing

869
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,860
something as high bandwidth there's a 3G

870
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:38,629
4G connection you need something that's

871
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:40,610
full duplex so like a hack RF won't cut

872
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:42,050
it and you need to be able to have that

873
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:43,879
that family to go through there and

874
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:44,590
you'll likely need test SIM cards as

875
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:49,370
well

876
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:51,550
so IMSI caching or MC caching is a

877
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:54,229
technique mostly used by law enforcement

878
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:55,850
which you know has a whole bunch of

879
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:58,790
steps there's specialized devices you

880
00:31:55,850 --> 00:32:00,830
can buy online to do it but look the

881
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:03,020
real takeaway for imci caching is that

882
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:04,669
it's illegal so in this case in this

883
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:06,620
engagement we knew that this was

884
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:09,650
theoretically an option but we weren't

885
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:13,969
going to go and do it the next shop next

886
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:16,280
option though also illegal but this one

887
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:18,200
you know in this case we were in a

888
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:19,730
telecommunications provider and we had

889
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,640
their appropriate authorizations to

890
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:24,590
stand up a appropriately-named

891
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,780
test 3G network so we actually could do

892
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:28,429
this attack but you need to have the

893
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:29,840
appropriate approvals and it depends on

894
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:31,790
the country and that kind of thing as

895
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:34,760
well but basically you need to set up a

896
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:37,850
test 3G network using your SDR and

897
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:40,400
software like open BTS BTS you need a

898
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:42,110
SIM card programmed for it there's a lot

899
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:44,150
of buggy instructions that are out of

900
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:46,699
date and don't work and a bit of prayer

901
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:48,500
involved and whatnot but ultimately we

902
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:51,800
had these test SIM cards we stuck him in

903
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:55,250
our SOS devices and they would never

904
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:56,810
ever connect to our base station it just

905
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:57,890
absolutely failed we tried a lot of

906
00:32:56,810 --> 00:33:00,290
different things but at the end we just

907
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:01,910
had to you know put a pin in it and say

908
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:03,500
we're gonna leave that one it's not

909
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:04,820
working for us it's you know too

910
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:07,460
complicated we don't know why it's not

911
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:10,730
working so we we moved on

912
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:12,650
and that led us to bus moving so the

913
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:14,090
snooping is the easiest way I can

914
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:16,910
describe it is it's like Wireshark for

915
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:20,330
electrical signals so basically you are

916
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:22,850
trying to sniff and analyze and decode

917
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:24,290
the the signals that you know the actual

918
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:26,750
electrical signals that are traversing

919
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:29,600
along a board so let's look at our

920
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:31,850
device again and how we're gonna you

921
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:35,209
know theoretically do this in green

922
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:37,309
again we have our arm CPU and in red is

923
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:39,350
the the SIM card slot which as I said

924
00:33:37,309 --> 00:33:42,050
has the baseband processor underneath it

925
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:44,990
now based on our firmware analysis and

926
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:47,419
data sheet analysis as well we we

927
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:50,600
basically figured out that that arm CPU

928
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:53,510
through some of its serial pins is going

929
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:55,219
to instruct the baseband processor to

930
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:57,140
talk to the Internet to talk to that

931
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:58,670
back-end server so therefore between

932
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:02,000
those two there must be something

933
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:03,410
interesting there but in order to do

934
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,420
that you can't destroyed our by shark of

935
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:07,700
course and the tool you need is a logic

936
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:09,590
analyzer so this is a Salette which is

937
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,970
an example of a logic analyzer again

938
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:14,480
generally considered to be one of the

939
00:34:10,969 --> 00:34:16,158
better ones and you basically need to

940
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:20,240
connect it up and it will analyze the

941
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:22,730
signals so we've got this theory now of

942
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:24,168
how we think we can really break in and

943
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:26,359
understand how it communicates so let's

944
00:34:24,168 --> 00:34:28,069
put this into practice so this is a

945
00:34:26,359 --> 00:34:30,619
picture of you know similar to what we

946
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:33,020
saw earlier some very skillful soldering

947
00:34:30,619 --> 00:34:34,760
which was absolutely not done by me it

948
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:38,480
was done by a much more skilled solder

949
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:39,980
in my team but basically we worked out

950
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,750
you know as I said we're the serial pins

951
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:43,969
were that might communicate with the

952
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:46,070
baseband processor sold it onto those

953
00:34:43,969 --> 00:34:47,449
pins so that and glued it on as well so

954
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:49,700
that it wouldn't keep breaking like it

955
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:52,549
initially did then we hook that up to

956
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:55,850
the Salette and then hook the Sligh up

957
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:58,430
to the laptop and start decoding signals

958
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:59,750
across the wire now I don't expect you

959
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:01,490
or anybody to see the details here the

960
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:04,010
only thing I expect you to see is that

961
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:06,319
there's an up and down going along there

962
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:10,670
and that is actually the signal on the

963
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:12,590
wire being captured by the Select and

964
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:18,140
when we actually looked at what this one

965
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:19,820
was it interpreted out to this now some

966
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:21,799
of you may be something old

967
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:23,450
people in the room might recognize what

968
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,670
this is this is actually a modem command

969
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:27,950
so the 80 series of commands are the

970
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:29,420
protocol to communicate with a modem it

971
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:31,009
actually stands for attention which I

972
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:34,730
didn't know so it's like attention do

973
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:36,470
this and this is what we saw so we saw

974
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:39,500
now we were really looking at what this

975
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:41,240
processor was telling the baseband this

976
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,500
was a completely benign instruction that

977
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:44,330
doesn't make sense to me no matter how

978
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:46,580
many times I read it but we knew were in

979
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:48,290
the right spot so it was a case then of

980
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:49,700
doing more captures getting the device

981
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:51,800
to do something and seeing what actually

982
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:55,850
happens and this was the interesting

983
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:58,310
sequence that we saw so this first 80

984
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:59,839
command the CIP status is basically

985
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:01,520
asking the baseband are you connected to

986
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:03,440
the Internet and the base man says yes

987
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,810
yes I'm to exit the internet which is

988
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,130
cool then it says all right great you've

989
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:11,360
got a connection can you connect to this

990
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:12,800
custom access point name for me the user

991
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:15,410
name and password are in between those

992
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:19,700
quotes so blank but still connect to

993
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:21,319
this custom APN and it says ok done so

994
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:24,950
we're now connected up to where we need

995
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:27,260
to be then it says can you please start

996
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:30,950
a TCP connection - you know in this case

997
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:33,980
hidden dot server com on port 50,000 138

998
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:35,419
and at this stage we're you know really

999
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:36,650
pretty happy we're seeing a TCP

1000
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:39,830
connection going out to our back-end

1001
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:43,280
server you know along the wire here

1002
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:46,400
right on the board and then our next one

1003
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,930
is it's sending data over that TCP

1004
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:51,950
socket actually communicating with the

1005
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:54,770
backend so at this stage this is you

1006
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:57,259
know pretty much how we felt we were

1007
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:59,030
quite excited about this and you know we

1008
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:59,990
we really had kind of cracked in there

1009
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:01,850
and we're right where we wanted to be

1010
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:04,100
but we still need to understand what

1011
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:07,009
these communications were because this

1012
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:09,940
is the string that got sent and when you

1013
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:11,690
first look at that it's kind of not much

1014
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:13,550
but because you know we've been

1015
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:16,490
analyzing this solution a lot it quickly

1016
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:18,350
stood out to us that those numbers in

1017
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:19,609
red which are changed but those numbers

1018
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:21,950
in red are actually the I mean number

1019
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:23,810
the unique identifier of the device

1020
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:28,460
because everything with the you know SIM

1021
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:30,140
card based man has an ID number so we

1022
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:32,930
realized that the protocol in this case

1023
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:33,529
was just exclamation mark 1 comma I me

1024
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:36,710
and

1025
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:37,910
semicolon and then hex value one a but

1026
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:40,370
the beautiful beautiful part about this

1027
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:42,319
is it's actually the login request to

1028
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:43,730
the back-end server and some of you

1029
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,730
might have noticed that it's missing a

1030
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:48,620
factor of authentication just any factor

1031
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:50,780
of authentication it's pretty much just

1032
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:52,490
saying here's me and the service is

1033
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:54,440
great come on in tell me where you are

1034
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:57,830
send some SOS alerts whatever you want

1035
00:37:54,440 --> 00:38:00,140
to do so then we were just able to rip

1036
00:37:57,830 --> 00:38:01,190
that out stick it in a Python script and

1037
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:04,160
actually interact with that back-end

1038
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:06,200
server which was great we've really

1039
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:08,240
gotten under something there so what do

1040
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:10,580
we have so obviously there's no

1041
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:12,020
authentication you just need to know the

1042
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,520
I mean number but you know you saw the

1043
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:15,920
army numbers pretty big that's a fairly

1044
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:17,660
big key space but you know after five

1045
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,250
minutes of research we quickly realized

1046
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:20,930
that an army number is not unlike a MAC

1047
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:23,780
address it has kind of an organizational

1048
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:26,390
part few components to it but in the

1049
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:29,060
solution there were six digits that

1050
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:31,490
actually reflected the unique identifier

1051
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:34,130
of these devices so it's a really small

1052
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:36,529
key space and then so that's great you

1053
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:38,360
could probably brute force it but to

1054
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:41,480
make it even easier the server also

1055
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:43,790
responded nicely and told you if that I

1056
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:46,070
me existed in the system so we were now

1057
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:49,279
now able to enumerate every device in

1058
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:52,490
this solution and you know log in and be

1059
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,990
them and spoof location data and SOS

1060
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:56,500
messages and that kind of thing so we'd

1061
00:38:53,990 --> 00:39:00,680
really broken the system at this stage

1062
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:01,670
but you know how how bad is this and you

1063
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,990
know we were just kind of happy because

1064
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:04,850
we've done the technical hacks and that

1065
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:06,259
was cool but we started discussing it

1066
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:10,490
and we realized well I mean an attacker

1067
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:11,990
could actually go and basically spoof

1068
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:14,149
the location data of every single user

1069
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:16,069
and send out constant SOS alerts to all

1070
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:17,450
their contacts all the time and that

1071
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:18,890
would completely undermine the solution

1072
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:20,600
and they'd all throw it in the bin and

1073
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:21,920
the company you'd go bankrupt that's

1074
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:24,350
pretty bad

1075
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,700
but we also realized that you know it

1076
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:27,259
could be worse and it's a bit of a long

1077
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,879
shot but we realized that you could

1078
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:30,380
actually

1079
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:33,110
spoof location data for user and if that

1080
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:35,540
user actually was in a life-threatening

1081
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:37,370
situation and there SOS alone went out

1082
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:39,400
it would go to the wrong location that

1083
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:41,720
you've sent and they could actually die

1084
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,220
so you know that's very more but of

1085
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,660
course but you know that was like our

1086
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,490
worst case scenario and it's not very

1087
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,960
you

1088
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:49,089
or normal when your pentesting a

1089
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,920
solution that can kind of breach out

1090
00:39:49,089 --> 00:39:54,609
into that human layer and have impact

1091
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:56,349
like that so you know because I put so

1092
00:39:54,609 --> 00:39:57,848
much effort into these diagrams let's

1093
00:39:56,349 --> 00:40:01,089
revisit it one more time and just see

1094
00:39:57,849 --> 00:40:03,760
what we've what we've done here so we've

1095
00:40:01,089 --> 00:40:05,589
got a stock photo hardware hacker who's

1096
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,560
used his chisel and hammer to basically

1097
00:40:05,589 --> 00:40:10,200
hack the device work out how it

1098
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:12,430
communicates with that back-end

1099
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:14,439
completely compromised the backend of

1100
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:16,690
the solution and our poor user is not

1101
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:18,099
doing too well and for those of you with

1102
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:20,859
better eyesight the friend is also a

1103
00:40:18,099 --> 00:40:24,609
frowny face now so not a very good

1104
00:40:20,859 --> 00:40:26,740
situation so that's that's the the meaty

1105
00:40:24,609 --> 00:40:28,000
one that I wanted to go through but you

1106
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:30,490
know as I keep talking about the word

1107
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,910
testing the solution I want to go over

1108
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:38,200
this ECG it's electrocardiogram example

1109
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:40,089
as well so let's start with with what it

1110
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:42,098
is on before we get into this I just

1111
00:40:40,089 --> 00:40:43,570
like to point out that no hearts are

1112
00:40:42,099 --> 00:40:47,410
exploited or anything like that this is

1113
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:50,320
not not that bad kind of so basically

1114
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:51,848
this this ECG solution is effectively as

1115
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,890
I think I mentioned normally you need

1116
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:56,200
like 12 leads giant machine physician

1117
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:58,799
all done very properly this was you know

1118
00:40:56,200 --> 00:41:01,779
some kind of medical breakthrough where

1119
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:04,089
people can actually you know plug a

1120
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:06,430
dongle into their iPhone attached for

1121
00:41:04,089 --> 00:41:08,740
leads themselves and take accurate

1122
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:10,149
measurements and and then see the

1123
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:13,270
results straight away and share with

1124
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:14,950
their doctor that was pretty cool it was

1125
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:16,990
a really interesting solution like

1126
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:18,640
actually improving people's lives you

1127
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:19,509
might have heart problems and that kind

1128
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,598
of thing

1129
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:24,310
again it's part of a solution then so we

1130
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:25,960
need to analyze it in that way so we

1131
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:29,589
have a user there with a very well drawn

1132
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:31,869
heart and they use this mobile app with

1133
00:41:29,589 --> 00:41:33,190
the dongle attached to it the mobile app

1134
00:41:31,869 --> 00:41:34,900
talks to the web server and we have a

1135
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:37,780
doctor there who also logs into that web

1136
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:42,099
server to see the results of the of the

1137
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:44,950
ECG so let's let's go and actually

1138
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:46,180
assess this solution quickly so we

1139
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:48,189
started out with the hardware because it

1140
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:51,399
was shiny and groundbreaking and all of

1141
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:52,690
that and look you know I had to tell it

1142
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,910
but there's nothing interesting there at

1143
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:57,790
all it literally just took these signals

1144
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:59,379
off the users chest you know

1145
00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:01,960
rather than to digital and then the the

1146
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:04,060
app itself basically interpreted them to

1147
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:07,510
get results so it really wasn't very

1148
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:11,710
very interesting at all so we moved on

1149
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:15,550
to the to the app and again really

1150
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:17,950
nothing very interesting but meanwhile

1151
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:19,300
the website itself and this is what I'm

1152
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:21,819
talking about the actual you know

1153
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:23,950
assessing the whole solution it was

1154
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:25,810
vulnerable to good old-fashioned SQL

1155
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:28,830
injection so we had a shiny little

1156
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:32,980
device meanwhile the website complete

1157
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:35,410
SQL injection which actually affected

1158
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:37,180
every single user on the platform and

1159
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:39,009
this is obviously medical data here so

1160
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:43,509
with this SQL injection you could

1161
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:46,030
extract all the users medical data you

1162
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:48,690
can also modify all the users medical

1163
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:51,940
data or delete the users medical data

1164
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:54,580
and you know similar to the last story

1165
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:56,740
we had you know a nice moment of hey

1166
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:58,690
that's cool but surprising you know it's

1167
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,919
such a well-known vulnerability and you

1168
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:02,200
know people know how to mitigate this

1169
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,980
and this is a new system it shouldn't

1170
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,270
really have these kind of

1171
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:06,880
vulnerabilities if they just had a bit

1172
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:09,790
of framework bla bla bla but we again

1173
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:11,290
realized that you know with our more

1174
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:13,690
more bit hats on that if someone's

1175
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:15,550
actually testing themselves because they

1176
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:17,020
have a genuine medical need to they're

1177
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:18,970
uploading their results to share with

1178
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:20,410
their doctor and meanwhile some not so

1179
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:21,700
nice person he's performing SQL

1180
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:23,500
injection and removing those results

1181
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:25,450
that person may never seek that medical

1182
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:28,660
attention that they need because their

1183
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:29,919
doctor will never see it so you know

1184
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:31,450
that's that's obviously not very good

1185
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,830
and you know the reason why I'm talking

1186
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:34,779
about this one is just to really drive

1187
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:36,970
home that point of it's the whole

1188
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:38,830
solution that matters and even kind of

1189
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:40,480
more boring parts or parts you think

1190
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:42,549
could be you know tried and tested and

1191
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:45,250
stuff like that you know can really

1192
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:49,390
matter when it comes to to assessing you

1193
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:52,450
know the whole solution so we've gone

1194
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:53,770
over our our examples at the moment and

1195
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:56,589
now I want to take a bit of a bit of a

1196
00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:58,450
step back and look at why this why this

1197
00:43:56,590 --> 00:44:00,640
matters so you know I think I've

1198
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:02,529
demonstrated pretty clearly that you

1199
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,720
know the security of IOT solutions can

1200
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:06,490
you know impact lives and and you know

1201
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,390
information and all of those kind of

1202
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:10,529
things

1203
00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:12,808
so I think you know that's that's a

1204
00:44:10,529 --> 00:44:16,979
but you know there's also more to it as

1205
00:44:12,809 --> 00:44:19,889
I see it so this is a an article again

1206
00:44:16,979 --> 00:44:21,448
from Forbes discussing a start-up in

1207
00:44:19,889 --> 00:44:23,849
Israel that basically got a nice bit of

1208
00:44:21,449 --> 00:44:27,239
funding with no other purpose other than

1209
00:44:23,849 --> 00:44:29,519
to hack i OT devices for governments so

1210
00:44:27,239 --> 00:44:31,409
you know like it or not i OT you know

1211
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:33,658
pretty much is but you know is going to

1212
00:44:31,409 --> 00:44:36,089
be a target going forward and needs to

1213
00:44:33,659 --> 00:44:37,529
have some level of security and there

1214
00:44:36,089 --> 00:44:40,078
are other companies as well like this

1215
00:44:37,529 --> 00:44:42,659
that are basically set up to you know do

1216
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:46,069
lab research on IOT devices but

1217
00:44:42,659 --> 00:44:49,549
effectively to help people hack them

1218
00:44:46,069 --> 00:44:51,989
another point that I wanted to raise is

1219
00:44:49,549 --> 00:44:54,329
this Bain & Company article basically

1220
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:56,519
makes it quite clear that they at least

1221
00:44:54,329 --> 00:44:59,369
to their belief that if IT security

1222
00:44:56,519 --> 00:45:00,839
would actually improve enterprises and

1223
00:44:59,369 --> 00:45:02,609
businesses would actually start to adopt

1224
00:45:00,839 --> 00:45:04,199
it a lot more and they claim it's that

1225
00:45:02,609 --> 00:45:06,058
you know the key to actually unlocking

1226
00:45:04,199 --> 00:45:08,429
these IOT solutions and having them come

1227
00:45:06,059 --> 00:45:10,079
out into the enterprise and I really

1228
00:45:08,429 --> 00:45:13,319
think that's where that's where we come

1229
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:15,119
in so you know educating decision makers

1230
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:16,099
and solution designers with the issues

1231
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:18,569
at hand

1232
00:45:16,099 --> 00:45:20,009
you know providing our expert guidance

1233
00:45:18,569 --> 00:45:21,689
and advice and I hope some of you can

1234
00:45:20,009 --> 00:45:23,759
take some of these even there's

1235
00:45:21,689 --> 00:45:25,319
low-level lessons that if you have this

1236
00:45:23,759 --> 00:45:27,719
black box of hardware it could actually

1237
00:45:25,319 --> 00:45:29,069
be quite dangerous or could undo a whole

1238
00:45:27,719 --> 00:45:31,079
solution and it's not just to be

1239
00:45:29,069 --> 00:45:33,659
considered that's just a black box it's

1240
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:35,789
fine and obviously pentesting IT

1241
00:45:33,659 --> 00:45:37,559
solutions of course you know maybe I'm

1242
00:45:35,789 --> 00:45:39,449
biased but I think that's also a really

1243
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:42,899
critical step to knowing if they're

1244
00:45:39,449 --> 00:45:46,289
secure or not and given that I've talked

1245
00:45:42,899 --> 00:45:48,598
about you know basically analyzing right

1246
00:45:46,289 --> 00:45:50,579
at that chip layer all the way back to

1247
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:54,809
that cloud back-end you know web apps

1248
00:45:50,579 --> 00:45:56,880
mobile apps all of that I actually you

1249
00:45:54,809 --> 00:46:00,779
know decided to steal a very kind of

1250
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:02,489
hipster term from developers and I found

1251
00:46:00,779 --> 00:46:04,979
that no one else was using this online

1252
00:46:02,489 --> 00:46:07,189
at least of my very rudimentary googling

1253
00:46:04,979 --> 00:46:12,178
of it so I'm going to coin the term now

1254
00:46:07,189 --> 00:46:13,319
full-stack pentesters which some of you

1255
00:46:12,179 --> 00:46:14,909
may have vomited a little bit in your

1256
00:46:13,319 --> 00:46:17,189
mouth and when I said that because it is

1257
00:46:14,909 --> 00:46:19,289
a buzz word don't get me wrong but I do

1258
00:46:17,189 --> 00:46:21,178
think it actually somewhat correctly

1259
00:46:19,289 --> 00:46:23,290
encompasses the fact that you know going

1260
00:46:21,179 --> 00:46:25,840
forward being able to actually go

1261
00:46:23,290 --> 00:46:27,759
right from that chip you know the

1262
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:29,320
communications on the board through to

1263
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,970
the mobile app through to the wireless

1264
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:32,950
communications through to the servers

1265
00:46:30,970 --> 00:46:37,299
and the cloud backends is going to be

1266
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:38,799
really important so on that you know

1267
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:41,770
lovely note of full stack pentesters

1268
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:45,190
let's start to wrap up so I wanted to

1269
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:48,370
have some some parting thoughts so you

1270
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:50,500
know I think like it or not IOT is is

1271
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:52,509
coming I think if you're procuring or

1272
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:54,460
delivering these devices you need to be

1273
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:56,350
considering these kinds of risks and

1274
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:58,030
these security issues if you're a

1275
00:46:56,350 --> 00:46:59,890
product decision maker I think you're

1276
00:46:58,030 --> 00:47:00,970
gonna want to get these solutions tested

1277
00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:03,160
because you could be putting something

1278
00:47:00,970 --> 00:47:06,000
out in the market that you know could

1279
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:09,069
cause serious issues for for real people

1280
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,120
and you know as one of my last parting

1281
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:12,250
thoughts you know I think I've shown

1282
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:15,240
that you know during a traditional pen

1283
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:17,710
test timeframe you can you can actually

1284
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:19,240
successfully find and exploit you know

1285
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:20,890
serious vulnerabilities in an IOT

1286
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:24,370
solution you know using hardware hacking

1287
00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:27,220
techniques but what we need is more

1288
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:28,630
skills in this area and this is

1289
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:30,580
somewhere where if you want to be that

1290
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:33,010
that hardware hacker up there on the

1291
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:34,900
screen you know we need to be skilling

1292
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:36,970
up as an industry so in my experience

1293
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:39,190
you know living and working in Europe

1294
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:40,569
seeing some of the u.s. trainers as well

1295
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:43,030
I feel like Australia is lagging behind

1296
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:45,130
a little bit when it comes to hardware

1297
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:46,390
hacking skills don't get me wrong

1298
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:48,160
there's people with skills there's

1299
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:50,200
interest a lot of it's there but I just

1300
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:52,060
don't see it to the same level as what I

1301
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,439
did overseas and to give you an example

1302
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:55,450
in the Netherlands is actually a

1303
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:57,220
security conference called Hardware i/o

1304

courses associated with it well and it's

1307
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:04,240
just a complete conference dedicated to

1308
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:05,200

well I described as an intro to hardware

1323
00:48:38,599 --> 00:48:43,310
hacking course I think Sylvia calls it

1324
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:46,040
interfacing with IOT devices you know so

1325
