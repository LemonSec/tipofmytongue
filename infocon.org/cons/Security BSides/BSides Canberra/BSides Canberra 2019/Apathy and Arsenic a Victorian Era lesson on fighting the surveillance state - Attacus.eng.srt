1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:09,270
hey folks thank you for coming

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:11,269
can everyone hear me okay yep okay start

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:15,480
waving your arms about if you can't

4
00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:18,300
anyway I'm Atticus I'm a pen tester with

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,160
assurance and am a ward member of

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,380
Digital Rights Watch Australia

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,160
I'm a former historian and a future

8
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:28,320
cyborg you may remember me from such

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,330
conference talks is the one where I rant

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,570
about history and the one where I rant

11
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,370
about privacy and most popularly the one

12
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,680
where I rant about history and privacy

13
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:40,500
together and this talk falls into that

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,050
latter category so I want to talk about

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,700
arsenic and a mass surveillance because

16
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,849
there's a lot that we can learn from one

17
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:50,340
about the other and as a quick note um

18
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:53,670
during this talk I am gonna mention

19
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,920
death a lot I'll talk about murder a bit

20
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:58,320
and you'll hear quotes of threats that

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,420
people have made to other people and if

22
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,770
you are not in a good place to hear

23
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,350
about those things right now that is

24
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,060
extremely understandable and your mother

25
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:11,070
welcome to leave this session and do

26
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:14,340
another thing instead this is arsenic

27
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:16,289
trioxide arsenic sin natural element

28
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,090
it's been used for all kinds of things

29
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,979
since the time of the ancient Greeks but

30
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,780
for the next half hour or so while I'm

31
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:24,658
talking about arsenic I'm specifically

32
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:27,570
talking about this stuff a snake

33
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:29,189
trioxide or white arsenic and this is an

34
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,619
industrial byproducts that began

35
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:35,880
cropping up pretty much everywhere after

36
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:38,790
the industrial revolution began it looks

37
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:41,570
a lot like sugar or flour and when it's

38
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:45,540
mixed into food arsenic is colorless and

39
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:48,839
tasteless and odorless and extremely

40
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:51,509
poisonous if you take a lot at once it

41
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,790
has an effect much like cholera which is

42
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:55,979
kind of like the the worst diarrhea that

43
00:01:53,790 --> 00:02:00,180
you've ever had in your life followed by

44
00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:02,250
the end of your life if you only take a

45
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,960
little bit of arsenic at a time it can

46
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,759
make you tired it can make you a key it

47
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,649
can give you trouble breathing and in

48
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,269
England in the 1800's arsenic was very

49
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:11,009
cheap because it was a waste product

50
00:02:09,269 --> 00:02:12,750
that fir-trees wanted to get rid of and

51
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:14,029
you could get it almost anywhere in

52
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:17,300
almost anything and

53
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:19,970
anything I do mean anything for example

54
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,900
you could get it in cosmetics there were

55
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,090
a lot of companies that produce

56
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,640
arsenical wafers or powders that promise

57
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:27,440
to get rid of pimples and blackheads and

58
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,790
slow the signs of aging which is very

59
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,720
interesting if you think about it

60
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:35,209
I was also used domestically to kill

61
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,760
mice and rats and cockroaches and other

62
00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:39,950
pests so it was really easy to walk into

63
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,410
a shop and get a box of the pure stuff

64
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:44,600
to keep in the kitchen but I think was

65
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:47,180
most popular as a color pigment

66
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:49,430
especially an emerald green also known

67
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:52,580
as Paris green which was used in the

68
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:55,340
exact same form as a pigment by artists

69
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:57,680
and as a pest killer by farmers it

70
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:59,330
produced a really vibrant green color

71
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,850
that no other pigment was ever able to

72
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:04,580
give and because it was in pigments it

73
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:07,310
meant that arsenic ended up in pretty

74
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:09,410
much anything that needed color so cases

75
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:12,709
were recorded of people being poisoned

76
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:14,780
by arsenic in their playing cards and in

77
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:17,209
fabric dyes and in product packaging

78
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:20,329
arsenic also found its way into famous

79
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:21,560
art like van Gogh's Starry Night this is

80
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:23,090
one of several reasons that art

81
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:27,739
galleries do not like it if you look at

82
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:30,320
their paintings most notoriously it was

83
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:32,209
also in wallpaper wallpaper was put up

84
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:34,489
in the homes of anyone who could afford

85
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:34,910
it and because our Cenacle pigment was

86
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:36,410
cheap

87
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:38,780
eventually it meant that most people

88
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:40,760
could afford it the pigment dust would

89
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,799
come out of the walls if people brushed

90
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,450
past or if there was a breeze and if he

91
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,060
got damp which it did in England

92
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:51,230
especially it emitted a toxic arson as

93
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:53,420
gas you could get arsenical wallpaper in

94
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:55,280
in most Western countries but it was

95
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:57,500
especially a problem in England and in

96
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,329
the United States two countries that

97
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,430
were not really keen on government

98
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:03,530
regulation of industry what you're

99
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:05,989
looking at here is a digitized arsenical

100
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:07,959
wallpaper sample it came from a book

101
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:11,000
called shadows from the walls of death

102
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:13,310
this book was published in 1874 as part

103
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,200
of a public health campaign to raise

104
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:17,600
awareness of the dangers of our Senecal

105
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,969
wallpaper and it was eventually so

106
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,739
successful at its goal that out of the

107
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:23,300
original hundred odd copies that were

108
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:25,130
made there are now only four left

109
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,560
because people realized how poisonous

110
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:28,510
they were

111
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,250
some brave soul at the University of

112
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:34,389
Michigan digitized this one they are

113
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:35,740
hopefully still okay but because these

114
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:37,810
are pretty and they're in the public

115
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:42,100
domain you'll see a few examples of them

116
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:44,950
as I keep talking maybe most importantly

117
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:47,050
arsenic also had a reputation as a quick

118
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:48,669
way to make money because your family

119
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,710
would not notice if you stirred it into

120
00:04:48,669 --> 00:04:55,330
their tea and for this reason it was

121
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:57,010
also known as inheritance powder but we

122
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,570
are at a hacker conference which is why

123
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:01,870
we're also talking about digital privacy

124
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:04,000
or lack thereof and by this I mean the

125
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:06,430
current practice of various governments

126
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,290
and corporations gathering literally as

127
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:11,080
much data about everybody as they

128
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:12,100
possibly can and storing it forever not

129
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,080
always very well

130
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:16,870
I'm talking about Facebook and Google's

131
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,490
ad networks and metadata retention and

132
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,930
the dodgy apps that promise to make you

133
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:21,790
look really good in selfies and then

134
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:24,190
require a suspicious number of

135
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:26,680
permissions and the issues around my

136
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:29,290
health record and and and all of that

137
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,300
and then what happens to this data when

138
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:32,760
it's not secured properly or someone

139
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:36,430
inside a data gathering organization

140
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:38,919
develops a grudge or even when it's used

141
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:41,110
as its intended and then a thought nurse

142
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:44,109
a thoughtless new feature comes in

143
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:46,570
upsets everything so where the probe

144
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:49,810
where the topics of digital privacy and

145
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:51,669
arsenic intersect is that for a good

146
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:53,200
period of time despite the best efforts

147
00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:56,140
of people who knew what they were

148
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:59,050
talking about the public didn't really

149
00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:00,969
give a damn about either of them arsenic

150
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,560
and mass data gathering of both things

151
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,970
that have pervaded every day life in

152
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,960
large-scale ways that have seemed

153
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:10,090
impossible to change and despite lots of

154
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,680
well-informed people agreeing in their

155
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:14,560
respective centuries that these things

156
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,229
are damaging our well-being or our way

157
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,690
of life it's hard to get people to care

158
00:06:17,229 --> 00:06:22,599
or to think that things can change

159
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:24,760
they aren't great but things are just

160
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:28,360
you too useful they're too convenient

161
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:30,219
arsenic makes vibrant cheap shades of

162
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,320
green that look nice it gives you a

163
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:34,599
clear complexion it kills mice really

164
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:36,849
well data can tell us how to plant

165
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:38,380
cities it can provide accurate help us

166
00:06:36,849 --> 00:06:39,909
provide accurate medical care and it can

167
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:42,430
help us catch

168
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:45,100
but while these things don't change

169
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:47,100
people's lives have also been upended by

170
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:49,690
these things in increasing numbers

171
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:52,360
inhaling ambient arsenic didn't make

172
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:54,550
everybody sick in the same way one

173
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,470
person might die and another person in

174
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:59,919
the same house might just get bad

175
00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:01,650
headaches and just this way mass

176
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,669
surveillance and privacy invasion

177
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:07,229
disproportionately affect the members of

178
00:07:03,669 --> 00:07:09,940
society who are already most vulnerable

179
00:07:07,229 --> 00:07:12,190
then there are the more targeted attacks

180
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:13,690
both with arsenic and the data that can

181
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,520
become devastating to whoever's on the

182
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:16,570
receiving end

183
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:21,010
to illustrate my point I want to tell

184
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:23,560
you two short stories in 1852 an English

185
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:25,630
coal mine worker named William Mowbray

186
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,960
married a young woman named Mary Ann and

187
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:31,539
together they had nine children over the

188
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,820
next years seven seven of these children

189
00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:36,460
died tragically from what was recorded

190
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:38,440
as gastric fever in the mid 19th century

191
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:40,750
times were really hard and it wasn't

192
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:43,000
uncommon for children not to reach out

193
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:45,090
altered the couple collected the

194
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,889
insurance money and life went on after

195
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:51,669
13 years of marriage in the January of

196
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:54,370
1865 William Mowbray himself died

197
00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:56,620
tragically of gastric fever leaving Mary

198
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:58,360
Ann and her two remaining daughters to

199
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,830
make their own way in the world with a

200
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,710
little bit more insurance money to help

201
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:04,659
them on their way by the way the average

202
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:06,070
life insurance payout for an adult man

203
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:10,270
at this point in time was equivalent to

204
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:11,800
about his year's wages George Ward an

205
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:14,680
engineer was recovering from an illness

206
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:17,200
in hospital in 1865 when he fell in love

207
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:21,669
with a nurse named Mary Ann when they

208
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:24,130
were married in August 1865 Ward

209
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:26,049
tragically died of gastric fever 14

210
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:29,409
months later his wife collected the

211
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:32,770
insurance payout James Robinson was a

212
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:35,380
shipwright in 1886 he had a new baby son

213
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:37,870
and a recently deceased wife so he hired

214
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:40,570
a housekeeper to help him out the new

215
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:41,830
housekeeper a woman named Mary Ann had

216
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:44,169
only been living in the household for a

217
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:47,650
month when the baby died tragically of

218
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:49,660
gastric fever Robinson found that Mary

219
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:53,110
Ann's presence was emotionally helpful

220
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:55,719
and he married her in the August of 1867

221
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:57,130
by this time Marianne was pregnant with

222
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,470
their daughter who was born two months

223
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:01,090
after the wedding but the baby only

224
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:04,660
lived for three months before dying

225
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:08,110
tragically of gastric fever Marianne's

226
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:09,699
misfortune continued while she'd been

227
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:11,920
living with Ward one of her surviving

228
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,720
children from her first marriage died

229
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,030
tragically of gastric fever after

230
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,890
marrying Robinson her only remaining

231
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:20,110
daughter from her first marriage also

232
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,910
died tragically of gastric fever and so

233
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:22,810
did two of Robinson's children from his

234
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:25,030
first marriage

235
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:27,099
so did Mary Anne's mother just after

236
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:30,640
Mary Ann went to visit her and Mary Ann

237
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:32,500
inherited almost everything soon after

238
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,390
all of these tragedies James Robinson

239
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,190
the shipwright discovered that Mary Ann

240
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:39,490
had been stealing from him and running

241
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:41,350
up debts he also noticed that she was

242
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:42,910
becoming weirdly insistent that he

243
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:45,480
should take out a life-insurance policy

244
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:47,860
on himself which she refused to do

245
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,740
Robison kicked Mary Ann out of his house

246
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:54,340
and he did not die tragically of gastric

247
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:56,380
fever one of Mary Ann's friends took

248
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,820
pity on her tragic circumstances and

249
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:00,130
introduced Mary Ann to her brother

250
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:02,170
Frederick cotton cotton was a widower

251
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:05,590
with two small children of his own and

252
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:07,990
he fell into Mary Ann's arms when in the

253
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:10,420
March of 1870 his beloved sister Mary

254
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:13,420
Ann's friend died tragically from

255
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:16,599
gastric fever cotton and Mary Ann

256
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:19,180
married in September 1870 and in 1871

257
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,280
they had a son unfortunately before the

258
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:23,530
year was over Frederick cotton also died

259
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:26,050
tragically of gastric fever Mary Ann

260
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:27,579
collected the insurance money do you

261
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:29,530
know what happens next she moves in with

262
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:31,150
another guy and brings the surviving

263
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:33,250
kids and stepkids with her wills get

264
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:35,620
rewritten and suddenly pretty much the

265
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:38,350
entire household dies tragically of

266
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:41,140
gastric fever this left Mary Ann with

267
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:43,510
one remaining stepson who she complained

268
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:46,449
loudly about all the time to her new

269
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:48,819
employer when the boy took ill and died

270
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:52,590
tragically have gastric fever her boss

271
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:52,590
became suspicious

272
00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:58,819
I got the local doctor to delay issuing

273
00:10:55,849 --> 00:11:00,199
the death certificate when Maryann

274
00:10:58,819 --> 00:11:02,358
discovered she couldn't get the

275
00:11:00,199 --> 00:11:04,069
insurance payout on her stepsons life

276
00:11:02,359 --> 00:11:06,499
without the death certificate she had a

277
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:08,959
public meltdown about it which led to

278
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:11,359
people asking questions and then more

279
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,518
questions and then testing her stepsons

280
00:11:11,359 --> 00:11:16,609
remains for arsenic which was found in

281
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:19,009
abundance Maryann was convicted of his

282
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:23,659
murder and died tragically of rock

283
00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:26,479
poisoning in 1873 in her lifetime she

284
00:11:23,659 --> 00:11:28,789
had murdered 16 of her children and

285
00:11:26,479 --> 00:11:31,129
stepchildren four of her partners her

286
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:33,169
mother and an inconvenient friend and

287
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:37,129
collected insurance payouts and will

288
00:11:33,169 --> 00:11:40,129
benefits from almost all of them it now

289
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:42,199
takes a lot less time for criminal to

290
00:11:40,129 --> 00:11:44,959
make a lot more money than Maryann

291
00:11:42,199 --> 00:11:47,358
cotton ever did but instead of marrying

292
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:49,248
and murdering they can use the info out

293
00:11:47,359 --> 00:11:51,019
of stolen data dumps which are about as

294
00:11:49,249 --> 00:11:53,559
cheap and plentiful as arsenic was back

295
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:56,899
in the day so here's my next story

296
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:59,149
sometime after July last year some of us

297
00:11:56,899 --> 00:12:01,039
opened our inboxes and saw a threatening

298
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:02,929
email that might have looked like it had

299
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:05,149
come from our own email address the

300
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:08,988
message probably went a bit like this

301
00:12:05,149 --> 00:12:10,939
one hello I am a programmer who cracked

302

00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,079
of the unsecure site you visited and I

305
00:12:15,349 --> 00:12:20,719

309
00:12:26,119 --> 00:12:30,349
but it doesn't matter my rad software

310
00:12:27,769 --> 00:12:33,589

312
00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:38,569

313
00:12:35,599 --> 00:12:40,759
email account through your email I

314
00:12:38,569 --> 00:12:43,248
uploaded malicious code to your

315
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:45,169
operations system I saved all of your

316
00:12:43,249 --> 00:12:47,239
contacts with friends colleagues

317
00:12:45,169 --> 00:12:50,718
relatives and a complete history of

318
00:12:47,239 --> 00:12:52,339
visits to the internet resources also I

319
00:12:50,719 --> 00:12:55,009
install the rad software on your device

320
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:57,709
and longtime spying on you you are not

321
00:12:55,009 --> 00:13:00,079
my only victim I usually lock devices

322
00:12:57,709 --> 00:13:02,449
and ask for ransom but I was struck by

323
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:05,868
the sites of intimate content you very

324
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:06,620
often visit I am in shock of your reach

325
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:09,380
fantasies

326
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:11,720
Wow I have never seen anything like this

327
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:14,710
I did not even know that such content

328
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,710
could be so exciting

329
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:21,520
so when you had fun on intimate sites

330
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:24,160
you know what I mean

331
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:26,380
I made screenshot with using my program

332
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,449
from your camera of yours device after

333
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:31,150
that I jointed them to the content of

334
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:32,410
the currently viewed side will be funny

335
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:34,390
when I send these photos to your

336
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:36,490
contacts and if your relatives see it

337
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:39,400
but I'm sure you don't want it I

338
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:41,380
definitely would not want to I will not

339
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,880
do this if you pay me a little amount I

340
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:45,550
think seven hundred and fifty four

341
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,860
dollars is a nice price for it I accept

342
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:52,630
only bitcoins my Bitcoin wallet address

343
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:56,230
is some long string you have two days 48

344
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:58,570
hours for make a payment if this does

345
00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:01,630
not happen all your contacts will get

346
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:05,170
crazy shots of your dirty life do not

347
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:10,320
take this frivolously this is the last

348
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:10,319
warning I hope you will be prudent bye

349
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:16,030
so in just one month after these emails

350
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,550
first appeared researchers found that

351
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:20,020
about 70 point eight Bitcoin which is

352
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:21,880
about three hundred and eighty four

353
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:24,339
thousand Australian dollars in today's

354
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:26,050
exchange rate had been deposited to

355
00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:28,270
wallets that were listed in those scam

356
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:30,459
emails and when I checked again about

357
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:32,350
four months later just one of those

358
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:34,030
wallets had nine hundred and twenty

359
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:35,470
eight point nine Bitcoin in it which is

360
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:36,130
about five million Australian dollars

361
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:38,770
today

362
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:40,810
I tried checking again this morning but

363
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:43,480
after eight or so months the sextortion

364
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:45,849
scam idea has now spread to so many

365
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,290
people and turned up in so many

366
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:49,089
different languages that tracking the

367
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:51,130
number of Bitcoin wallets involved in

368
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:53,470
the scam took far more time than I had

369
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:56,439
available and this amount of money is

370
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:58,300
many many times more than a year's wages

371
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,800
for most of us and more money that

372
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:02,680
didn't Maryann cotton could ever have

373
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:05,229
dreamed of and I know a lot of a lot of

374
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:07,209
us in this room who got this email read

375
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:09,339
it and saw it for the scam that it was

376
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:11,290
and had a good luck but clearly many

377
00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:12,910
thousands of other people suffered

378
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:16,360
through their own private hell before

379
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:18,459
paying up the thing that sets these

380
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,620
so-called sextortion emails apart from

381
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:22,900
other traditional spam email is the

382
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:25,330
inclusion of real passwords from old

383
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,770
data dumps a lot of us probably know

384
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:28,259
exactly the kinds of breaches that these

385
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:30,299
things came from this

386
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:32,399
is easy enough to find mail merge is

387
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:34,108
easy to use and you only need a few

388
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:37,949
scared people to start seeing these

389
00:15:34,109 --> 00:15:40,019
results but most people don't know this

390
00:15:37,949 --> 00:15:41,459
stuff even today and the inclusion of

391
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:44,639
something like a password which they

392
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:46,049
thought was private makes it more likely

393
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,389
that they're going to get really scared

394
00:15:46,049 --> 00:15:50,399
and pay off and clearly they are paying

395
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:53,759
up because personal data is potent like

396
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,829
that but serial killers like Mary Ann

397
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,619
cotton were outliers when it came to

398
00:15:55,829 --> 00:16:00,149
arsenic death most people in Victorian

399
00:15:58,619 --> 00:16:01,649
England didn't need to live with a

400
00:16:00,149 --> 00:16:03,179
murderer to be poised with arsenic

401
00:16:01,649 --> 00:16:06,239
because as we already said arsenic was

402
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:09,329
everywhere gone men died from inhaling

403
00:16:06,239 --> 00:16:11,639
it off the walls in their sleep elderly

404
00:16:09,329 --> 00:16:13,529
women died after mistaking it for sugar

405
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:15,359
and putting it in their own tea and

406
00:16:13,529 --> 00:16:17,669
children died from being looked after by

407
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:19,589
nurses who were wearing uniforms that

408
00:16:17,669 --> 00:16:22,949
had been dyed with arsenical colours and

409
00:16:19,589 --> 00:16:24,600
far far more people didn't die but lived

410
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:26,160
with chronic headaches and breathing

411
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,839
problems in poor digestion that they

412
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,049
could never find a cause for in their

413
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,639
day and age in the same way large-scale

414
00:16:31,049 --> 00:16:34,858
personal data is not something that

415
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:37,739
needs to be used by individual criminals

416
00:16:34,859 --> 00:16:39,629
to cause problems as we know more formal

417
00:16:37,739 --> 00:16:42,299
uses of this kind of data can end up

418
00:16:39,629 --> 00:16:44,730
outing trans people like what happened

419
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:46,259
in 2014 when Google consolidated some of

420
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:48,720
their messaging services to create

421
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:50,189
hangouts which merged previously

422
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,109
separate accounts into one legal name

423
00:16:50,189 --> 00:16:54,899
identity and put lots of trans Google

424
00:16:52,109 --> 00:16:56,660
users in dangerous situations it can

425
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:59,369
also end up strongly influencing

426
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:00,868
democratic elections like what Cambridge

427
00:16:59,369 --> 00:17:03,239
analytic added to the u.s. presidential

428
00:17:00,869 --> 00:17:06,089
election in 2016 using Facebook's data

429
00:17:03,239 --> 00:17:07,949
it can end up stealing company secrets

430
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:09,269
like we learned in November last year

431
00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:11,399
when a Dutch team revealed that

432
00:17:09,269 --> 00:17:14,010
microsoft office 365 was sending the

433
00:17:11,398 --> 00:17:15,779
sentences before and after spelling and

434
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:17,250
grammar checked strings back to the

435
00:17:15,779 --> 00:17:21,119
Redmond mothership as telemetry data

436
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:23,279
which you can't turn off anecdotally I

437
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,619
have heard of plenty of people who've

438
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:27,209
given up on using large parts of the

439
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:30,928
internet and lots of different services

440
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:32,909
because working out who to trust and how

441
00:17:30,929 --> 00:17:34,799
to stay safe and in control was too

442
00:17:32,909 --> 00:17:36,389
complex without the layers of knowledge

443
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:39,809
that people like us have from working in

444
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:42,090
this industry but despite how much we

445
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:44,879
know it isn't great most people is too

446
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:46,620
kind of about the whole issue it's easy

447
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,230
to understand why people are either

448
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:51,178
apathetic about big problems or resigned

449
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:52,500
to the fact that horrible things are

450
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:53,340
happening and they can't seem to do

451
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,919
anything about them

452
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:57,629
the scale of them seems impossible and

453
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:01,970
the likelihood of it becoming a huge

454
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:05,490
problem for you this week is fairly low

455
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:08,370
the period of time where the most people

456
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:10,860
give the least of the dam is known as

457
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:13,350
peak indifference this is a term that

458
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:15,059
was coined by a Cory Doctorow in 2016

459
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:17,549
and when he was talking about how the

460
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:19,740
world was at a turning point with regard

461
00:18:17,549 --> 00:18:21,389
to the issue of digital privacy and he

462
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:24,029
argued that after this turning point

463
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:25,860
increasing numbers of people would begin

464
00:18:24,029 --> 00:18:27,690
to care about their privacy as

465
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:29,340
increasing numbers of breaches or

466
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:31,649
incidents affected them or affected

467
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:34,199
someone that they cared about doctor who

468
00:18:31,649 --> 00:18:35,520
linked this idea to the eventual success

469
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,549
of public health campaigns around

470
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,710
tobacco smoking but almost every issue

471
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:42,600
reaches peak indifference at one point

472
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:44,700
or another and then what happens to that

473
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,969
issue after that tipping point is

474
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:49,230
something that we can learn a lot from

475
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:50,760
where we pass peak indifference about

476
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:53,100
privacy in the West is kind of a

477
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:55,200
nebulous thing to work out and was it

478
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:57,600
after Edward Snowden's actions in 2013

479
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,880
was it after Ashley Madison or Target or

480
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,939
Sony you know I think it was definitely

481
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,559
sometime after March last year when the

482
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:08,070
Cambridge analytical stuff hit the fan

483
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:09,600
after that point we saw large-scale

484
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:11,370
inquiries into corporate data use

485
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,730
particularly in the United States and

486
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:16,918
lots of penitent looking CEOs and public

487
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:19,470
commitments to change and even if these

488
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:23,279
things were only for sure they were done

489
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:25,529
to appease this real growing and

490
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:28,559
enlightened public sentiment of disgust

491
00:19:25,529 --> 00:19:32,370
and mistrust at the way that data was

492
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:34,230
being gathered and used in June last

493
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:36,418
year the Pew Research Center in the

494
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:38,190
United States found that in the previous

495
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:40,679
12 months seventy-four percent of

496
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:42,870
Facebook users had either adjusted their

497
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:44,970
privacy settings taken a long break from

498
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:48,029
using Facebook or they had deleted the

499
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:49,620
app completely then the gdpr came into

500
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:51,929
force in Europe which meant that

501
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:54,040
companies suddenly had to pay a lot more

502
00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:55,420
attention to the data that they had

503
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,370
and everyday people were suddenly

504
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:59,220
getting emails from everyone that they'd

505
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:02,199
ever forgotten they'd signed up with

506
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:04,270
telling them how important their privacy

507
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,340
was and how meaningful their consent

508
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:09,940
would be if they so graciously decided

509
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:12,129
to bestow it awareness of just how much

510
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:14,200
data complete randoms could see about

511
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:15,910
them led to more people taking proactive

512
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,640
steps to gain control of where their

513
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:21,550
information was going but how do we keep

514
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:24,430
up this momentum we can't let it happen

515
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:26,290
naturally more and more people ending up

516
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:28,720
the victims of data breaches and

517
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:31,120
identity theft and account takeovers and

518
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:34,780
leaked nudes or we can maintain it

519
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:36,280
thoughtfully and with purpose we spent

520
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:39,280
all this time talking about arsenic for

521
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:41,379
a reason 19th century England had its

522
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,240
own peak indifference moment and people

523
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:47,200
tried a whole bunch of ways to keep this

524
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:48,610
issue central I estimate that peak and

525
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,020
difference about the domestic arsenic

526
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:53,800
problem probably happened somewhere

527
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:55,330
between 1850 and 1870 by 1900 arsenical

528
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,220
wallpaper was hardly worth mentioning

529
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:59,350
except where someone occasionally found

530
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:01,930
some and had to handle its removal in

531
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:04,169
this time two important things gained

532
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:07,450
momentum awareness of the problem and

533
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:08,410
resistance to the problem awareness

534
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:10,870
happened the more that people were

535
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:13,600
educated literacy increased and I don't

536
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:15,850
mean just actual reading skills but

537
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,830
general scientific literacy increased

538
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:19,899
tiny particles of poison in an

539
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:21,610
environment are hard to see and without

540
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:24,010
advanced scientific knowledge for that

541
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:26,800
period of time they were conceptually

542
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:29,500
kind of hard to understand but slowly

543
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:31,570
over time the concepts of things like

544
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:33,850
germs and disease communication and

545
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:35,950
chemical pollutants became understood by

546
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:39,459
scientists and eventually more generally

547
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:41,320
understood by the public in 1840 James

548
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:42,850
Marsh developed a test which could

549
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,679
detect the presence of arsenic in a

550
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:46,469
human body something which had

551
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:49,210
previously been impossible

552
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:51,070
suddenly knowing that your use of

553
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:52,660
arsenic could be detected by other

554
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:55,270
people and traced back to you but the

555
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:59,620
people were a lot less casual about

556
00:21:55,270 --> 00:22:01,030
poisoning each other on purpose in 1854

557
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:05,409
a doctor called John Snow

558
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:07,360
not this guy this guy in 1854 a doctor

559
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:09,130
called John snow realized the

560
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,809
series of cholera outbreaks in London

561
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:12,340
were happening because one of the public

562
00:22:10,809 --> 00:22:14,200
water supplies was contaminated with

563
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:16,750
something that spread the disease this

564
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:19,690
went against the commonly held theory

565
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:22,720
that disease was spread by miasma or bad

566
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:24,880
air and that breathing the air around a

567
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,700
sick or a dead person was the thing that

568
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,260
would transmit all diseases so snow

569
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,510
tracked down the source of the

570
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:33,400
contaminated water remove the handle off

571
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:35,770
the public pump that gave access to it

572
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:37,630
and the cholera outbreaks stopped and

573
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:39,760
this led to the development of modern

574
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:41,320
sewer systems and built a better public

575
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:45,940
understanding of germs and

576
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:48,370
microorganisms so awareness ended up

577
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:50,169
leading to resistance protests

578
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:52,178
literature played a huge part in helping

579
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:54,730
people to convince others to join the

580
00:22:52,179 --> 00:22:56,620
resistance efforts things like shadows

581
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:58,990
from the walls of death was an

582
00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:01,120
in-your-face presentation of the problem

583
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:03,490
it put the focus on wallpaper

584
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,780
manufacturers to make changes and not

585
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:06,809
just the individuals who had brought

586
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:09,940
wallpaper into their homes

587
00:23:06,809 --> 00:23:12,100
England's to this day has never passed

588
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:15,040
any meaningful laws banning the sale or

589
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:16,719
use of arsenic in wallpaper but it

590
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:19,240
turned out that regulations in other

591
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,470
countries like France and Germany had

592
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,540
much more of an impact on how much

593
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:24,820
arsenic turned up in English households

594
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:28,000
and this was mostly down to fashion and

595
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:31,120
consumer choice most European countries

596
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,510
had outright bans the use of arsenic and

597
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,469
pigment manufacturing since the 1860s

598
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:37,120
because of this they suddenly became

599
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:39,280
innovators for new paint pigments that

600
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,290
created bright colors without using

601
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,270
arsenic on because everything French is

602
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:45,940
automatically fancy people were into it

603
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:47,500
fashion like it does eventually trickled

604
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:49,900
down through the whole industry and over

605
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:51,460
time lots of places in England ended up

606
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:55,120
offering arsenic free products like

607
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:57,880
wallpaper for affordable prices in fact

608
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,379
most manufacturers had no choice the

609
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,090
pigments that they used to color their

610
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,830
wallpaper mostly came from Europe in the

611
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:05,049
first place so it was getting difficult

612
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:08,830
to find any that contained arsenic even

613
00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:10,629
if they wanted to one of the best things

614
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:13,149
about this outcome was that it created

615
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:14,770
accessible alternatives for everybody

616
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:17,050
including people who still believed in

617
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:19,330
things like the miasma theory it was

618
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:20,530
unrealistic to expect that every single

619
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:22,120
person in 19

620
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:23,500
century england was subtly going to

621
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:25,989
develop a scientific understand

622
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:29,050
understanding equivalent to that of a

623
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:31,090
professional chemist people have jobs to

624
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:33,070
do and lives to get on with the vast

625
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:35,350
majority of people did not have access

626
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:38,050
to the kinds of educational backgrounds

627
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:40,330
that would allow them to even begin to

628
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:43,419
start understanding just exactly how

629
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:45,580
domestic arsenic use was a problem so

630
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:47,620
the creation of arsenic free tech that

631
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:50,139
was affordable to obtain and easy to use

632
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:52,510
and provided just the same kind of

633
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:54,340
experience meant that those people were

634
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:56,020
being carried along and helped to solve

635
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:59,080
the problem without having to become

636
00:24:56,020 --> 00:25:01,720
activists themselves and nowadays it's

637
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:05,500
rare to see arsenical wallpaper except

638
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:07,300
behind thick glass in museums for those

639
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,980
of you who've already read this far into

640
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:10,780
the analogy you know that we're already

641
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:13,240
doing a whole lot of these things when

642
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:16,060
it comes to the privacy fied we're doing

643
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:17,980
the awareness bit it seems like everyone

644
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:20,110
and their goldfish has either beans who

645
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:21,400
will run at least one crypto party and

646
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:23,290
every other day there's a new how-to

647
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:25,390
guide about how do you signal or tor

648
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:27,250
that gets published VPNs

649
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:30,070
things they get advertised on commercial

650
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:32,110
television and we're doing the

651
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:34,179
resistance bit to you make you but

652
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:37,629
you've been quite a safety TPS thing and

653
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:40,200
the gdpr is a thing firefox build ad

654
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:42,070
blockers into their browsers now

655
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,770
password managers the things that our

656
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:46,929
relatives have started asking us about

657
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:48,610
Apple markets privacy as a feature of

658
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:51,880
their tech and people who can afford it

659
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:54,219
pay thousands of dollars to get it where

660
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,840
we are calling out the companies who are

661
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:57,880
perpetuating unfair systems we're

662
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:01,209
pressuring them in a thousand ways to do

663
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:03,460
things differently so why does it still

664
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:05,380
feel like nothing has changed I mean

665
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:07,630
don't get me wrong all of these things

666
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:09,340
are positive steps in pushing back

667
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:11,500
against accepting data harvesting and

668
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:14,590
privacy violation as normal or

669
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:16,420
inevitable but the third thing which the

670
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:20,260
arsenic fight had going for it which we

671
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:22,210
don't have yet is time this all took a

672
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:24,220
lot of time and a lot of effort and a

673
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:25,780
lot of repeating information a lot of

674
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:28,360
petitioning governments to make changes

675
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:30,100
and sometimes it worked and sometimes it

676
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:32,110
didn't work but people kept doing it

677
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:33,830
because arsenic kept poisoning people

678
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:35,330
and it was the right thing to do

679
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:37,570
and now we have wall decorations that

680
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:40,158
don't kill us slowly in our sleep

681
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:42,110
thinking about the long game it's really

682
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,580
damn hard I mean I am a millennial and

683
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:46,158
if you believe the papers I'm something

684
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:48,980
avocados and patience is difficult but

685
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,809
time is really the key ingredient we

686
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:52,880
have to keep doing this and not give up

687
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:54,408
and not given the cynicism and repeat

688
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,049
ourselves until we're sick of it and

689
00:26:54,409 --> 00:26:59,120
then keep going keep pushing for

690
00:26:57,049 --> 00:27:01,250
grassroots education efforts like and

691
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,678
public education I was like crypto

692
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:05,299
parties and community events official

693
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,799
education efforts from local governments

694
00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:08,899
and anyone who wants to get on board

695
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:11,269
talk to your friends and your relatives

696
00:27:08,899 --> 00:27:12,678
when they ask you about it help the

697
00:27:11,269 --> 00:27:14,630
people who want to understand this get

698
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:16,549
the information that they need keep

699
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:18,260
writing and speaking and about these

700
00:27:16,549 --> 00:27:20,029
issues wherever you can and if you can't

701
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:22,669
boost the voices of others who are

702
00:27:20,029 --> 00:27:24,590
already doing it keep the heat on

703
00:27:22,669 --> 00:27:26,000
lawmakers inside and outside of your

704
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:27,918
country you know if your government

705
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,570
isn't doing anything meaningful remember

706
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,029
that the French and German laws had a

707
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:34,490
significant impact on English attitudes

708
00:27:32,029 --> 00:27:36,110
to arsenic in a lot of ways gdpr is

709
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:38,779
doing a similar thing precedent-setting

710
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:40,789
really helps and push for more

711
00:27:38,779 --> 00:27:42,710
legislation that gives us back control

712
00:27:40,789 --> 00:27:44,929
of our private information and imposes

713
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:46,460
strong penalties for its misuse and push

714
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:49,010
against every piece of legislation that

715
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:50,299
threatens to weaken that argue thing

716
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:54,049
considered regulations that will

717
00:27:50,299 --> 00:27:55,730
actually work in practice do it even

718
00:27:54,049 --> 00:27:57,860
though we already did this last month

719
00:27:55,730 --> 00:28:00,169
and three months ago and last year and

720
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:02,360
in the 90s organisations will keep

721
00:28:00,169 --> 00:28:04,340
trying it on again and again they trust

722
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:08,178
it will get tired we need to be aware of

723
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:09,620
that and to work around it be a voice of

724
00:28:08,179 --> 00:28:11,899
reason in your own communities

725
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:14,360
there probably people in this room who

726
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:15,889
probably knows someone who's stolen

727
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,750
information and used it to mess someone

728
00:28:15,889 --> 00:28:19,750
else up or know people who've said

729
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:21,860
meaningless data gathering as a KPI

730
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:24,049
challenge these folks to do better and

731
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:25,850
if you've ever been one of these people

732
00:28:24,049 --> 00:28:27,519
it is not a perfect universe challenge

733
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:31,010
yourselves to keep doing better too and

734
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:33,159
do you research fact check corporate

735
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:35,750
privacy spin we know Facebook especially

736
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:37,279
invests big money into saying that it's

737
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:40,309
doing the right thing they just paid

738
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:43,010
through the nose for a global billboard

739
00:28:40,309 --> 00:28:46,220
setup and an apology to it to do it so

740
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:47,299
hold them accountable we probably have

741
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:49,460
the biggest responsible

742
00:28:47,299 --> 00:28:51,320
to try will to keep trying to make the

743
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:52,700
world better for the people who don't

744
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:54,830
have the level of knowledge that a lot

745
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:56,600
of us do the average person in the 19th

746
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:58,730
century wasn't a chemist and the average

747
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:01,219
person in the 21st century isn't a

748
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:02,749
hacker not everybody wants to be and not

749
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:05,090
everybody is able to be and there's

750
00:29:02,749 --> 00:29:06,169
absolutely nothing wrong with that some

751
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:08,090
folks are gonna keep calling it's

752
00:29:06,169 --> 00:29:10,460
paranoid forever oh they'll minimize the

753
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:11,809
risks or they'll insist that they have

754
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:14,059
nothing to hide and that anyone who does

755
00:29:11,809 --> 00:29:16,039
is a criminal but we can keep making the

756
00:29:14,059 --> 00:29:19,100
world better anyway because we're the

757
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:21,470
ones who can all of us in this room are

758
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:23,418
in a unique position to understand the

759
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:25,070
scale of suffering and the damage that's

760
00:29:23,419 --> 00:29:27,409
caused by pervasive surveillance and

761
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:30,139
privacy invading systems no matter whose

762
00:29:27,409 --> 00:29:31,609
hands they're in it's likely that most

763
00:29:30,139 --> 00:29:33,590
of us are here because we like breaking

764
00:29:31,609 --> 00:29:35,689
things and solving puzzles and getting

765
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:37,639
creative with computers and because we

766
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:39,769
have that knowledge we can do something

767
00:29:37,639 --> 00:29:44,090
about it we have to keep doing something

768
00:29:39,769 --> 00:29:45,739
about it the scariest thing about giving

769
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:48,859
this talk here in this room to you folks

770
00:29:45,739 --> 00:29:51,559
is that nothing is so incredibly uncool

771
00:29:48,859 --> 00:29:52,970
as optimism but I really want to be

772
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:54,889
optimistic and I really want you folks

773
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:59,090
to be optimistic and to keep giving a

774
00:29:54,889 --> 00:30:00,769
damn it's cynicism gets you retweets and

775
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:02,539
dunking on optimism there's a lot easier

776
00:30:00,769 --> 00:30:04,730
than caring about something but if you

777
00:30:02,539 --> 00:30:06,440
actually do give a damn you have to

778
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:08,419
think about the long game and have

779
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:10,639
patience and keep doing what you think

780
00:30:08,419 --> 00:30:12,769
is right even though there are days and

781
00:30:10,639 --> 00:30:15,289
years where it seems like nothing ever

782
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:17,389
changes I know some of you burnt out on

783
00:30:15,289 --> 00:30:20,200
this stuff years ago decades ago it

784
00:30:17,389 --> 00:30:22,820
really does take a lot of time it sucks

785
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:24,619
though now it's real and it's a thing

786
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:26,450
that you were definitely allowed to feel

787
00:30:24,619 --> 00:30:27,830
but we can do it and if you're exhausted

788
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:29,230
by it support other people to keep

789
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:31,100
trying

790
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:33,769
imagine that someone's giving this talk

791
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:35,439
and 150 years provided we've somehow

792
00:30:33,769 --> 00:30:38,840
managed to survive the sea levels rising

793
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,730
what does the long view of this fight

794
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:42,499
look like what's the optimistic angle

795
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:44,450
who are the Mary Ann Cotton's in this

796
00:30:42,499 --> 00:30:46,359
future version of the talk and who are

797
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:48,710
the James marshes and the John snows

798
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:50,749
what did shadows from the walls of death

799
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:52,239
contain that is so toxic that nobody

800
00:30:50,749 --> 00:30:54,529
wants to touch it anymore

801
00:30:52,239 --> 00:30:58,580
we can't answer these questions as long

802
00:30:54,529 --> 00:31:00,310
as we don't give up thank you so much to

803
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:03,100
all of these people who

804
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:04,360
we make this talk of thing and if you've

805
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:06,100
got any questions or thoughts on this

806
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:07,959
topic feel free to come and chat to me

807
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:10,010
during the lunch break without thank you

808
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:18,359
for coming along to hear me

809
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:18,359
[Applause]
