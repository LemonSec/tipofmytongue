1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,040
our next talk is uh someone who's

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,640
you you might have seen on the regio

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,279
desk he's also been helping out on staff

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,080
um we have a strong sort of electronics

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,280
um

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,400
uh uh community uh besides canberra uh

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,920
with our electronic badges that we do

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:16,800
every year

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,560
and josh is a part of that community and

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,160
quite often does uh

11
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,119
um you know beginner uh workshops for

12
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:24,880
people to help them get into

13
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,279
electronics um today he's going to talk

14
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:28,640
about um

15
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,359
i think i've actually not turned the

16
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,640
page

17
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,040
sorry

18
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,760
yeah so electronic hardware design that

19
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,800
was probably one i should have

20
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,680
remembered

21
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,840
i'm saying please round of applause for

22
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,840
josh

23
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,200
so yeah g'day everyone um as kylie has

24
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,640
mentioned i do a lot of electronic

25
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,079
design and at the last

26
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,520
b-sides i was hanging up in the hardware

27
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,520
village a lot of people had the badge

28
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,879
that echo made it was awesome and had

29
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,000
questions how would they design

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,440
their own and so i thought it might be

31
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,359
interesting to give a quick rundown

32
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,440
from start to finish on how you'd build

33
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,959
a circuit board

34
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,400
this won't be enough to teach you how to

35
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,600
do it but it'll give you the tools that

36
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,119
you can go home and possibly bring

37
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,400
something cool to next year's b-sides

38
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,439
so with that said there's going to be

39
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,280
roughly two parts to the talk uh the

40
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,479
first first part is gonna be a little

41
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:17,840
bit of theory uh which might get a bit

42
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,799
boring but the

43
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,640
second part is going to be fun uh which

44
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,240
is where i'm talking through a number of

45
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,119
boards that i've made

46
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,640
including that bow tie which if anyone

47
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,400
saw me at red joe has been lighting up

48
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,759
and i'll turn it on at the end um so

49
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,439
potentially the most boring but the most

50
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,799
important part is setting up the

51
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,240
requirements at the start

52
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,560
now for a conference badge like this i

53
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,680
argue the most important thing is that

54
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,640
it looks good

55
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,000
and so in this case i choose to make it

56
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,479
look like a bow tie and i also decided

57
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,880
to add a bunch of leds to it

58
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,040
now partially due to covert partially

59
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,159
because you're not going to be able to

60
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,360
touch it i thought i'd also add a

61
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,200
microphone so that you can talk to it or

62
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,560
light up or change colors

63
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,200
and it's a nice way to interact with it

64
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,640
if it's not going around your neck all

65
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,920
day you might not have to be too

66
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,200
concerned about this

67
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,040
but in this case they were the primary

68
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,799
objectives in designing

69
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,079
the board so the first place you might

70
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,520
be wondering is well how do you start

71
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,000
this you

72
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,199
know what you want to make but where do

73
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,120
you actually look for it and this is

74
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,560
where just jumping on the internet

75
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,800
and finding similar projects so in my

76
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,480
case i just searched sound reactive

77
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,280
leds also known as a vu meter you might

78
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,959
see as like the audio levels

79
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,959
and i found a bunch of tutorials on

80
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,720
where you go about designing that

81
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,800
um in particular adafruit and sparkfun

82
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,400
uh are two companies they make a bunch

83
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,680
of open source hardware

84
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,200
and most importantly do a bunch of

85
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,879
really great documentation

86
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,400
on how you actually implement them

87
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,480
boards and make things work so

88
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,160
now that was the first step for this

89
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,239
badge but other places you might find

90
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,560
is open source hardware so all my works

91
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,000
up on github you can see the projects

92
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,200
that i've worked on

93
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,879
you'll also find hacker day i o has a

94
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,360
bunch of other projects out there

95
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,040
otherwise the chip manufacturers really

96
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,640
like selling you their parts and so

97
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,160
they'll have evaluation boards they'll

98
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,440
have application notes

99
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,959
and they'll have the data sheet which

100
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,640
has all the information you need to get

101
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,360
your board into the world

102
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,720
once you've figured out the parts that

103
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,319
you want to use the next step is called

104
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,360
schematic capture

105
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,519
which is basically where you draw a big

106
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:08,879
picture that shows how everything's

107
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,239
meant to be connected

108
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,599
the schematic is quite nice and that you

109
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,200
don't have to follow the laws of physics

110
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,159
when you're doing this

111
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,400
so if you have a look up at the image

112
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,760
there on the right you'll see that the

113
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,920
pins aren't in the right order

114
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,440
and you also see that this isn't the

115
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,959
same form factor as what you actually

116
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,319
put on the circuit board

117
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,840
and that's good because if you look at

118
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,280
it you can see on the left we have the

119
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,799
resistors and the capacitors

120
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,200
which set our timing circuit on the top

121
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,440
we have power on the bottom we have

122
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:33,920
ground

123
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,920
and then on the right we have our output

124
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,000
um and as you can see there's no wires

125
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,599
crossing you can add labels

126
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,879
and another thing i've done with this is

127
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,400
i've added a comment down below so

128
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,200
essentially

129
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,239
what's that there is this little magpie

130
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,519
which is flashing so

131
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,360
it's at roughly one and a half hertz and

132
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,799
the only way i know that is because i've

133
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,400
drawn it down underneath

134
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,360
on the schematic before you go on to the

135
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,799
next step which is layout i thought it

136
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,080
might be interesting to see what the

137
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,159
insides of the circuit board looks like

138
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,080
i'm sure i'm sure we've all seen the

139
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,000
green rectangles inside electronic

140
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,439
devices but this is what the

141
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,599
cross section of them looks like um so

142
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,200
starting at the top right we have what's

143
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,640
known as a silk screen

144
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,680
and this is where you have all the

145
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,840
device markings the board name and all

146
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,200
the reference designators for all the

147
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,478
components

148
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,320
underneath that we have all the green

149
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,440
which is on the board which is known as

150
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,478
the solder mask

151
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,320
and what what this does is it stops the

152
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,840
solder flowing all over the board so

153
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,199
what you'll have is solder mask top and

154
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:25,680
bottom

155
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,960
and then you'll just remove it where you

156
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,440
have pads now traditionally it's been

157
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,000
green

158
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,360
as you can see on our badges here i

159
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,040
believe it's black there's a bunch of

160
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,320
different colors available

161
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,520
which can make your board look pretty

162
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,000
cool moving over to the left

163
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,199
we have what's known as a plated through

164
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,360
hole or a via what these allow you to do

165
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,639
is jump from the bottom of the board

166
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,040
down to

167
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,880
the top of the board down to the bottom

168
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,880
and so you can use both sides of it

169
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,479
in this case here this cross section is

170
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,080
actually a four layer board and so you

171
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,639
can see the v

172
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,720
it touches layer one layer two and then

173
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,280
i believe layer four down at the bottom

174
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,800
moving across the left we have the

175
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,400
external copper which on a two layer

176
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,600
board is all the copy you'll have you'll

177
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,039
have some on the top some of the bottom

178
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,479
this is the traces you can see running

179
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:03,440
around

180
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,800
and then because this one's here is a

181
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,080
full layer board you also have an

182
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,280
internal layer

183
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,479
and something like your mobile phone

184
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,919
might be 10 or 20 layers so there's a

185
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:10,320
lot

186
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,400
inside and then finally it's all held

187
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,520
together by what's known as

188
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,600
fr4 or glass fiber which is just kind of

189
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,800
gives it its mechanical properties

190
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,639
so now you kind of know what the insides

191
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,080
of the circuit board look like

192
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,160
it's time to lay it out and so basically

193
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,759
this is the biggest game of connect the

194
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,520
dots that i've ever played uh because

195
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,680
what happens is on the schematic side

196
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,520
you tell basically yourself what you

197
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,120
want to look like and then when you go

198
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,880
into layout the cad tool

199
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,720
helps you join everything the difference

200
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,160
is you have to obey the laws of physics

201
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,440
this time so

202
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,120
as you can see here i've picked an eight

203
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,280
pin part with a kind of two rows on each

204
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:43,759
side

205
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:44,800
i've put the capacitors and the

206
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,160
resistors that we saw on the previous

207
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,960
page there

208
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,639
uh and as you can see also in the middle

209
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,080
where it goes to red i've had to use a

210
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,160
va to go onto the other side and come

211
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,479
back

212
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,400
up now when you've done all of that

213
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,600
you have the schematic done your layout

214
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,120
done and it passes all the design rule

215
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,720
checks this is when you can now go out

216
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,080
an audio board which is the

217
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,800
exciting time so typically what you do

218
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,560
from the pcb is export what are known as

219
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,840
your gerbers which are manufacturing

220
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,479
files

221
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:09,759
give them a quick review to make sure

222
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,840
everything looks okay then upload them

223
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,360
to a there's a plenty of board houses

224
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,240
online

225
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,440
the most important part when you're

226
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,720
uploading it is picking the color that

227
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,600
you want

228
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,280
but you can obviously do another bunch

229
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,720
of options there

230
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,960
now onto the component side of things

231
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,319
from the schematic you can export what's

232
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,600
known as a bill of materials which is

233
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,880
all the parts so in this case here you

234
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,080
had a triple five timer

235
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,840
you had a few capacitors a few resistors

236
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,520
and the led

237
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,960
normally what i would say is after you

238
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,639
finish designing a circuit board take a

239
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,240
day or two off to relax and then order

240
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,120
your parts

241
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,400
however there's a massive component

242
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,840
shortage right now and so what i

243
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,199
normally recommend doing is

244
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,560
as soon as you figure out what parts you

245
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,759
want buy them because they're probably

246
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:44,960
going to be out of stock by the time

247
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,520
that you're done

248
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,560
now on to assembly now depending on what

249
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,160
parts you pick so as you can see there

250
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,880
on the right

251
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,240
uh they're all surface mount parts but

252
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,759
they're quite large probably about twice

253
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:56,880
the size to the

254
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,720
parts inside your batch if anyone has

255
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,080
pulled them apart

256
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,440
and so with that you can solder them by

257
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,120
hand with a soldering iron um but

258
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,400
depending on if you say

259
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,919
doing the badge for example you might

260
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,440
want to use a solder paste stencil and

261
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,120
refloat in the oven uh i'll talk to

262
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,400
those methods later

263
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,240
but in recent years if you look at those

264
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,680
parts you're thinking these are way too

265
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,319
small

266
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,319
a lot of the circuit board manufacturers

267
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,400
will also offer assembly services even

268
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,919
in small volumes which makes it a lot

269
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,479
more accessible

270
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,720
so with that i'll go on to the boards

271
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:31,360
i've designed as examples

272
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,599
so my goal uh for this year was here

273
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,199
just have something nice

274
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,720
and colorful around my neck i'll see if

275
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,400
i can turn that on um

276
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,400
but i also wanted to pick parts i'd

277
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,080
never worked with before so this was an

278
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,120
actual

279
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,960
representation of if i was going into

280
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,800
this blind and had no idea what i was

281
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,680
doing

282
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,440
so in this case here i found a

283
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,360
instruction from adafruit

284
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,280
and so what they had they had their

285
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,560
feather development board which is the

286
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,199
black one

287
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,599
in the middle they also had the leds at

288
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,199
the top and the microphone you can see

289
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,319
in the bottom right

290
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,160
um i also decided to add an

291
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,080
accelerometer accelerometer on there but

292
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,960
it didn't end up

293
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,280
making onto the final design um now

294
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,720
doing on a breadboard like this is great

295
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,160
for a first prototype because if you

296
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,360
find that something doesn't work

297
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,879
such as the accelerometer you can just

298
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,479
pull it off and reuse it on another

299
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:15,120
project

300
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,639
it's also really good because you might

301
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,080
find that certain pins on the micro

302
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,080
controller can only do certain things so

303
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,199
some of them might not be able to do an

304
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,960
analog input other ones might not be

305
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,080
able to do a high speed

306
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,000
data output and so you can just plug the

307
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,440
wires in and out until you get

308
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,360
everything working

309
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,960
however there's one massive problem with

310
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,479
this is that if i wore that around my

311
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,760
neck it'd probably fall apart in the

312
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,799
first five minutes

313
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,080
and so we need to find something a

314
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,839
little bit more permanent for the

315
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:40,159
conference

316
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,159
and so this is might be the next step

317
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,200
once you've done your breadboard

318
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,200
prototype is basically replacing all the

319
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,720
wires that are on the breadboard

320
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,120
with traces on a circuit board so in

321
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,880
this case here we still have

322
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,560
the microcontroller in the middle and

323
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,920
the microphone down the bottom just like

324
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,760
we had on the previous

325
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,760
board i have called this a through-hole

326
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,519
pcb but there are surface mount

327
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,000
leds and capacitors around the outside

328
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,760
however they're very large and very easy

329
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,800
to solder

330
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,480
but you could potentially do it all

331
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,279
through hole if you would like

332
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,760
this board is an identical one to one

333
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,440
except for the two extra leds it's

334
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,200
identical to the breadboard prototype

335
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,959
which meant as soon as i uh soldered it

336
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,640
together i could copy the exact same

337
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,120
phone

338
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,360
so firmware over to it and it was off

339
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,320
and running

340
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,839
now this is great if you're going to do

341
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,440
a small number of boards um

342
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,920
because there's relatively little

343
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,360
engineering time that goes into getting

344
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,160
it working

345
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,600
uh compared to something i'll show you

346
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,920
later and it'd still be quite

347
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,600
nice and easy to assemble however if you

348
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,959
wanted to build a few thousand of these

349
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,720
such as your conference badge

350
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,920
doing this by hand will be a lot of

351
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,760
manual labor and it might not scale too

352
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,680
well

353
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,959
so i'll just quickly run you through how

354
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,480
you might go about designing that type

355
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,279
of board

356
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,560
and so you can see here that's the

357
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,320
schematic that's basically all it is

358
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,160
there's a bunch of extra leds off onto

359
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,680
the other side but

360
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,959
you basically have the microphone on the

361
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,880
left the micro controller in the middle

362
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,040
and then the leds out on the right um a

363
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,399
few extra things such as the mounting

364
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,440
holes so you can run

365
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,079
them i can't pronounce lanyard and then

366
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:05,760
you also have a little um solderable

367
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,200
jumper if you want to change the gain

368
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,360
but i didn't end up using that um in

369
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,040
this case here there's four unique parts

370
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,800
and 26 parts overall

371
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,800
and it's fairly straightforward to

372
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,240
layout and assemble

373
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,480
so speaking of the layout here it's just

374
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,079
a two layer circuit board uh we have a

375
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,519
ground on the bottom we have all of our

376
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,040
power and signal on the top

377
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,959
um i was able to pull the footprints for

378
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,320
these um from

379
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,079
libraries available online so i didn't

380
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,000
need to draw them

381
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,399
however i did do them myself if i wanted

382
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,760
to and that actually caused a problem

383
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,320
later

384
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,160
um but it's fairly simple they're all uh

385
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,519
parts are in the kycad library you just

386
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,880
drew a nice big circle around the

387
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,440
outside

388
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,480
and it's good to go um speaking of

389
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,320
assembly uh it's very straightforward so

390
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,760
just a soldering iron to solder all the

391
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,959
through-hole parts

392
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,320
and the same with all the surface mount

393
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,079
parts they're quite big and so they're

394
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:51,040
nice and easy to do

395
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,600
by hand um one mistake i did make

396
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,800
because i really wanted the cymbals to

397
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,519
look nice

398
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,040
is that i had the headers for the

399
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,279
microphone out 180 degrees but it was

400
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,920
fairly easy to fix with some wires

401
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,320
uh and speaking of firmware because i

402
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,760
was using the same development board

403
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,839
with the exact same wiring and schematic

404
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,800
as the breadboard it was just as simple

405
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,000
as copying it over

406
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,760
uh now on to the final design which i've

407
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,279
got around manic now and if yeah anyone

408
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,880
saw me at reggio you probably saw it uh

409
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,839
doing its thing

410
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,360
um this is kind of what i was hoping to

411
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,880
get to as the final project

412
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,160
um i had you can actually wear it as a

413
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,079
bow tie but it's nicer to have around

414
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,800
on your lanyard and so in this case here

415
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,839
i want it to be

416
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,079
looking really good which a green circle

417
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,279
for me doesn't look quite as nice as a

418
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,399
bow tie

419
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,000
i wanted it to also look a bit nicer and

420
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,200
that all you have on the front is the

421
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,959
leds you can't actually see the brains

422
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,360
behind how it works

423
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,640
in saying this however there's a lot

424
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,839
more time and effort that goes into

425
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:44,720
bringing this up

426
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,000
and as i'll discuss later there are a

427
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
few mistakes um but the other nice thing

428
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,880
about this is is

429
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,000
let's say we wanted to make this the

430
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,680
conference badge for next year not that

431
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,800
i think we should

432
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,320
it would be fairly easy to build a bunch

433
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,160
of these because with the exception of

434
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,040
the microphone

435
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,720
it's all surface mount parts and so you

436
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,240
can just run it through a machine very

437
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,040
easily

438
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,560
but it does take a lot more time to set

439
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,560
up at the start

440
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,639
um so i'm not expecting to be able to

441
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:07,839
read the schematic i'm just trying to

442
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,120
show that there's a lot more parts on

443
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,680
this

444
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,440
so instead of before where we had the

445
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,519
microcontroller dev board from adafruit

446
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,959
um what i've had to do is i've had to

447
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,560
break all those individual parts that

448
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,240
was handled for us on the micro

449
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,160
on the dev board out by itself so you

450
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,320
can see up in the top left we have usb

451
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,000
going down the left we have power and

452
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,920
charging then we have the microphone

453
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,000
sorry the microcontroller in the middle

454
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,279
uh off to the right we have the

455
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,160
microphone

456
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,920
a few kind of things that just hold

457
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,440
everything together in the bottom right

458
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,959
and because there are so many leds on

459
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,120
here it has a completely separate page

460
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,839
which is somewhere in the middle now

461
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,680
this obviously takes a lot more time

462
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,200
a lot of the parts that i've used on

463
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,800
this schematic here weren't available in

464
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,399
the default libraries for the cad tool

465
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,760
that i used so i had to design them up

466
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,120
myself

467
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,839
and all up we had 30 unique parts and 92

468
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,040
parts total so there's

469
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,279
a lot more parts to put together so if

470
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,240
you just want to build one or two of

471
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,839
them it might not make quite as much

472
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,079
sense

473
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,600
layout for this was a little bit more

474
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,360
complicated but not too much it's still

475
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,639
a two layer circuit board

476
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,480
i have all the leds on the front and

477
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,240
everything else on the back

478
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,160
it's using some smaller surface mount

479
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,760
parts similar to what's in your badge

480
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,600
today so they're small enough i can do

481
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,959
them without a microscope

482
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,560
which is nice doing the artwork and the

483
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,839
outline for this i'm not very good at

484
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:20,800
graphic design

485
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,079
but i was able to pull in a photo

486
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,079
through inkscape that i was able to

487
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,440
define the board outline so that's how

488
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,880
we got it to look like a bow tie

489
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,320
instead of just using the inbuilt

490
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,920
drawing tools i also

491
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,920
was able to import some graphics for the

492
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,440
front so it kind of looks like a bow tie

493
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,279
another thing with this is that i fully

494
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,800
3d modelled it because i was doing all

495
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,000
the components

496
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,920
kind of from scratch and so what this

497
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,760
allows you to do is to see exactly what

498
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,120
it's going to look like before you get

499
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,000
it ordered

500
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,760
in my case it was used to design the

501
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,279
little 3d printed part which will hold

502
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,800
it around your lanyard

503
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,320
but take for example the badge we've all

504
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,839
got around our next right now

505
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,279
a lot of effort i imagine would have

506
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,800
gone into making sure the injection

507
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,240
molded plastic in the middle was going

508
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,199
to fit

509
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,360
and doing this you can design the

510
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,320
mechanical parts

511
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,000
see if it's going to work if not you can

512
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,519
move the bolts and things around until

513
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,000
it does

514
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,519
and keep on iterating so you know it's

515
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,959
going to fit and everything work

516
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,920
properly when you get it back

517
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,320
onto assembly of this like i was saying

518
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,360
it's a two-sided

519
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,040
we have parts on both sides so it means

520
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,880
we're going to need to make it go

521
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,639
through the reflow oven twice

522
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,720
and so this is a slightly more kind of

523
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,399
advanced and complicated method what we

524
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,279
do is we get what's

525
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,880
a solder paste stencil which is

526
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,399
basically a big sheet of stainless steel

527
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,000
where we cut our holes out wherever we

528
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,440
want solder paste

529
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,519
then we squeeze a squeezy squeegee the

530
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:34,560
solder paste

531
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,079
over the circuit board and then we have

532
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,680
paste on all the pads that we want

533
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,079
we then put the parts onto those pads

534
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,680
put them in the reflow oven and about

535
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,360
seven minutes later they come out

536
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,120
all soldered on if you don't have a

537
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,720
reflow oven you can also use a hot air

538
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,360
gun

539
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,399
which is good if you've got a small

540
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,000
number of parts but for a big board like

541
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,720
this

542
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,480
and i do this a lot so it saves a little

543
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,000
bit of time

544
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,399
one cool tool that i've found recently

545
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,399
with this is known as interactive html

546
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,040
bom

547
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,120
um it's a it's started as an add-in for

548
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,480
kai cad but it's on a lot of the

549
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,920
cad tools both open source and

550
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,000
proprietary and what it allows you to do

551
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,440
is basically you import your bill of

552
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,360
materials you give it the board file

553
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,639
and then it will tell you where to place

554
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,800
all the parts so you can see here

555
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,480
i've selected the buttons that are on

556
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,160
the back one for reset and two so i can

557
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,360
toggle the state

558
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,959
and when i get to that line it will

559
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,399
highlight where the buttons are it can

560
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,920
show me the orientation and i can put

561
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,800
them down

562
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,240
and that's particularly helpful for when

563
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,680
you've got a bunch of small capacitors

564
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,360
and all the footprints look identical

565
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,639
but you only need to put them in two or

566
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,880
three positions so for those out there

567
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,079
that are doing

568
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,519
assembling boards at home this might be

569
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,320
something interesting to look at

570
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,600
getting the firmware up and running on

571
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,800
this it was also a little bit more

572
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,839
challenging

573
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,759
because unlike when we buy the board

574
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,360
from adafruit it already has the

575
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,800
bootloader and in this case i'm actually

576
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,320
running python on the board

577
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,440
just because it's nice and easy to

578
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,880
program you plug it directly into your

579
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,720
computer shows up as a memory stick

580
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,720
you can then edit the code.pi file save

581
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,560
it and it runs again

582
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,880
however when you get a microcontroller

583
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,040
from the vendor there's nothing on there

584
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,240
and so you first have to flash a

585
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,000
bootloader which is what the four pins

586
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,959
over on the right

587
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,120
are that requires an external programmer

588
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,720
you plug in you put the bootloader on

589
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,120
there

590
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,560
then once the bootloader is on there you

591
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,480
can plug in usb and put circuit python

592
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:10,800
on

593
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,240
and then once circuit python's on there

594
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,839
you can put your firmware uh

595
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:14,880
and if you're anything like me you put

596
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,880
the code on there and nothing works and

597
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,959
so after a little bit of debugging

598
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,560
i found a few issues including but i

599
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,000
didn't actually hook the microphone up

600
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,199
to the microcontroller

601
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,959
which for some reason causes uh some

602
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,399
problems and there are also some issues

603
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,680
with the power circuit

604
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,279
but i'll show you how i fix them later

605
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,759
on um so all up whereas the

606
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,199
earlier boards took somewhere between

607
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,959
half an hour and two hours to get the

608
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,160
firmware up and running

609
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,000
this one took me about four days all up

610
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,519
by the time i added some extra features

611
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:40,480
that were on this

612
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,000
um but not on the previous development

613
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,600
boards

614
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,360
um so yeah here are some of the photos

615
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,279
of the mistakes that i've made

616
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,720
so you can see this was just simply in

617
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,560
the schematic i had the output of the

618
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,480
microphone labelled as microphone out

619
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,480
i had the input into the micro uh into

620
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,639
the microcontroller labeled as mic

621
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,560
in or something like that and of course

622
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,519
they don't connect because they're

623
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,720
different names

624
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,480
this is where the electrical rules check

625
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,839
which is a tool in the schematic can

626
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,520
help you find some mistakes

627
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,720
but there are plenty like this that just

628
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,480
won't spot but fortunately we're able to

629
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,839
fix that

630
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,760
and there was also an error on the power

631
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,400
circuit side of things a part was in

632
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,679
opposite direction to what it normally

633
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:16,959
is i didn't pick it up because i

634
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,240
designed these boards

635
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,640
two very late nights back to back but

636
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,359
were able to

637
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,720
fix that there and then although i've

638
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,240
been talking about making blinking

639
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,280
things that around your neck

640
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,280
that are really cool for a conference

641
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,880
that kind of process i've just outlined

642
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,039
can be used for absolutely anything so

643
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,720
in particular recently i've been

644
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,720
interested in fpgas with open source

645
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,600
tool chains

646
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,679
fpga stands for field programmable gate

647
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,440
array they're used when you need to put

648
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,120
a lot of data through in parallel so for

649
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:43,679
example

650
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,440
the part in the top left-hand photo you

651
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,039
can find one of them inside an elgato

652
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:47,679
cam link

653
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,360
to do a lot of the hdmi to usb

654
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,360
processing and then down in the bottom

655
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,039
left there there's a slightly smaller

656
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,280
fpga from the same family that i've used

657
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,240
in earlier that

658
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,600
earlier version of that board for a lot

659
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,120
of education work and i know there's a

660
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,320
few people in the building now that

661
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,280
actually have one of them

662
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,200
probably sitting in a drawer somewhere

663
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,360
um outside of that i've also done a bit

664
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,960
of work on the rf side of things so

665
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,480
there's a low cost vector network

666
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,919
analyzer in the top right

667
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,200
what it is it's a tool to measure

668
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,280
antennas and other rf components they're

669
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,640
normally quite expensive

670
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,919
but kind of going through the process i

671
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,280
went through there but optimizing for

672
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,640
cost instead of performance

673
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,160
i was able to get one that works pretty

674
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,320
well in a small form factor and small

675
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,120
price

676
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,200
um and then i had some leftover parts

677
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,200
and so in the bottom right hand corner

678
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,120
you can see a board that's in the same

679
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,360
feather kind of physical format

680
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,600
as both the fpga and the microcontroller

681
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,440
i used in the prototyping stages

682
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,200
and this just plugs in on top and allows

683
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,679
you to generate signals for some testing

684
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:40,960
other examples that might be more

685
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,720
security related that we've seen over

686
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,440
the weekend

687
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,720
if you have a look at the bus side from

688
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,559
what silvio spoke about this morning

689
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,400
um you'll see that's where you've taken

690
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,160
a off-the-shelf microcontroller

691
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,039
but broken or broken all the pins out to

692
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,400
locations where it makes it really easy

693
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,280
to plug in a

694
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,640
spy flash chip or round the cables over

695
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,000
to your device under test you're trying

696
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,080
to probe um and then if you also saw

697
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,520
iggy's talk yesterday he was just

698
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,120
building something as a one-off

699
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,600
to dump the flash of his device but if

700
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,960
there were a lot that needed to be made

701
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,080
for your team or if it was something

702
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,039
that you were doing

703
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,799
quite often you might be able to kind of

704
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,480
follow the same steps to come with a

705
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,520
tool that

706
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,799
kind of similar to this it's not going

707
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,640
to fall apart and you can use it for

708
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,120
days or years at a time

709
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,480
and so with that said that's coming to

710
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,720
the end um if you are interested in

711
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,240
learning more this talk's just trying to

712
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,919
be an introduction to make you aware of

713
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:28,640
the process

714
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,960
and things you might be interested in

715
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,919
looking at

716
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,520
if you jump onto that github link there

717
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,440
all the slides along with the design

718
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:35,919
files

719
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,160
are available obviously can't recommend

720
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,600
ordering either of the two boards that

721
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,559
i've just spoken about because they're

722
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:41,760
not going to work

723
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,600
but you can have a look at how i've done

724
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,960
the schematic how i filled out the bill

725
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,840
of materials

726
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,360
i have all the assembly documents and

727
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,520
everything there as well

728
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,039
there's also a whole heap of links to

729
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,039
much more in-depth uh kai-cad which is

730
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,480
my tool of choice it's an open source

731
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,760
ada tool

732
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,200
there's also a bunch of other options

733
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,880
out there but there's a bunch of links

734
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,880
to doing more in-depth design that will

735
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,360
give you

736
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,440
kind of a more detailed view and then

737
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,280
finally if you have any questions please

738
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,799
don't hesitate to say hello

739
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,000
i should hopefully be pretty easy to

740
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,760
spot with this i'll be hanging around

741
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,520
the t-shirt area of the salvo

742
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,120
otherwise you can find me online at

743
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,880
those places whether you just have a

744
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,240
question you're interested a project

745
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,120
that i've worked on

746
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,720
or what i'd love to hear is that if

747
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,000
you're about to order your own board and

748
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,360
you have any problems doing that or you

749
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,120
just like a second set of eyes

750
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,039
so maybe you don't have many uh as many

751
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,320
flying wires as i do

752
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,080
please don't hesitate to get in touch so

753
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,600
with that um thanks for listening and

754
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:35,840
i'll pass it back to kylie

755
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,039
thanks joshua's uh really interesting we

756
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,280
have a few questions on the slack

757
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,919
um which supplier either australian or

758
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,679
or overseas would you recommend for

759
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:46,960
small run boards

760
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,679
uh so i'm not going to name any specific

761
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,200
names but there are a bunch of lower

762
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:51,520
cost

763
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,360
chinese board and assembly houses that

764
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,559
i've used

765
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,240
depending on the quality and the

766
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,600
quantity that you need there are

767
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,000
various pros and cons unfortunately for

768
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,280
this kind of hobbyist level stuff

769
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,720
there's not really a cost-effective

770
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,159
solution in australia

771
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,240
but there are a number of very high-end

772
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,919
board and assembly houses here that do

773
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,640
amazing work

774
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,960
this one i'm not sure if you answered it

775
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,039
later in the talk but for hobbyist grade

776
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,440
smd board manufacturer and prototyping

777
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,159
tools

778
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,799
do you recommend anything in particular

779
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,159
or is the standard still a

780
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,320
cheap taster oven modified for solder

781
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,679
reflow yes so

782
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,440
i basically use all the cheap tools off

783
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,039
ebay um you can get a

784
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,640
hot air gun for about forty dollars i

785
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,080
can't remember the product code if you

786
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,919
come have a chat to me we can find it

787
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,840
um but yeah so either a toaster oven

788
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,200
that you've uh fit your own

789
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,559
reflow controller to give you the right

790
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,559
profile is a good way to go otherwise

791
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,240
i've got about a 300

792
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,000
um it's kind of designed as a reflow

793
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,600
oven you had to flash different firmware

794
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,120
and make a few changes to it but

795
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,840
there are plenty of uh yeah small

796
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,480
low-cost

797
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,480
uh affordable solutions for hobbyists

798
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,039
like myself

799
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,080
um can you comment on the cad tools and

800
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,400
all plugins for schematics capture

801
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,159
all the ones you'd recommend all right

802
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,000
so um i use kicad

803
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,320
which is an open source eda tool um a

804
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,120
few years ago

805
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,720
it might not have been quite a parody

806
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,799
but now i firmly believe it's the best

807
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,400
tool for hobbyists out there

808
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,159
there are other tools such as eagle and

809
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,000
easy eda they're designed as hobbyists

810
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,559
but i

811
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,480
personally prefer kaicad and there's

812
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,919
also a whole heap of

813
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,120
professional tools that are out of my

814
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,960
budget that are very nice

815
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,400
one thing i do like about kaicad

816
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,760
compared to a lot of the other tools is

817
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,080
that

818
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,400
add-ons such as interactive html bom can

819
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,919
be developed for kai-cad with

820
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:32,960
first-class support

821
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,400
and then they typically get ported to

822
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,640
other pieces of software but

823
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,480
yeah anything there's plenty of options

824
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,840
out there on any of the three ones

825
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,880
should do a good job for hobbyists

826
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,640
um do you have any preferred languages

827
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,559
and libraries libraries

828
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,159
for writing the firmware for boards um

829
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,799
and why yes so i try to stay away from

830
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,559
firmware as much as i can

831
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,559
when i do do it it's either in arduino

832
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:57,679
or c

833
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,400
typically use stm parts and they have

834
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,360
their cube

835
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,799
ide and hardware language i think maybe

836
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,320
if you jump into the badge channel

837
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,679
on slack and have a chat to the folks

838
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,039
who built this badge they might be able

839
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,880
to provide a little bit more insight

840
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,960
and like well for today i decided to use

841
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,159
python because i

842
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,080
had never used it before and i wanted to

843
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,760
focus most my time on getting the badge

844
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,720
up and running

845
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,480
instead of writing firmware um do you

846
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,159
think factory assembly will become

847
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,400
flexible enough for hobbyist projects

848
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,919
especially for people who don't have

849
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,760
access to the more expensive tools

850
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,480
yeah it has been getting easier and

851
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,840
better in recent years

852
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,640
so one of the board houses that i use a

853
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,240
bit basically has an in-house surface

854
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,200
mount assembly

855
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,919
line whereas where if you pick parts

856
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:42,559
that are

857
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,080
in their library they can assemble them

858
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,480
for you at very reasonable prices

859
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,320
otherwise the other option is there are

860
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,840
board houses that are now doing five and

861
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,520
ten unit minimums where it used to be in

862
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,400
the hundreds

863
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,000
where they'll just get someone to hand

864
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,440
place them similar to the process that

865
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,640
i've outlined so

866
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,080
there are definitely options out there

867
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,679
that make it easier without buying all

868
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:00,960
the tools and worrying about small

869
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,640
components

870
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,640
and i have a question have you tried

871
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,279
assembling the add-on parts yet for them

872
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,039
i i haven't uh we've been pretty busy

873
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,960
doing red john's stuff but i'm very keen

874
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,480
uh and actually i haven't had time to

875
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,919
play with the badge but i'm very very

876
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,440
keen when we get home

877
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,120
to give it a go and there's some small

878
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,640
parts in there yeah

879
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,559
very very small any tips on getting

880
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,240
those onto the badge uh i'd normally

881
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,760
cheat and say use a microscope

882
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,000
um but yeah being young and having good

883
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,440
eyesight which i don't have

884
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,840
can also help okay i did but yeah hot

885
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,360
air gun lots of flux

886
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,279
and that's probably your best bet at

887
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,799
getting it going

888
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,200
awesome okay great thanks again josh and

889
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:44,559
we have another round of applause
