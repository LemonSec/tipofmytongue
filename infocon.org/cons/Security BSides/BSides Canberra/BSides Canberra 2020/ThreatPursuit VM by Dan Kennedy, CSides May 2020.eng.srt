1
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:45,879
just waiting for everyone to show up so

2
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:48,160
we had this whole practice Silvio is

3
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,910
going to do the intro but anything much

4
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,800
so I'm just sitting there in silence but

5
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:58,959
we have actually been running Seaside's

6
00:00:53,800 --> 00:01:00,910
or mocking meter since 2013 about eight

7
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,040
years of meetups face to face we've

8
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:06,070
never streamed before but of course we

9
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:09,780
are in a interesting time so we have to

10
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:14,020
adapt or die saying we want to keep on

11
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:16,719
the technical talks see science is all

12
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:19,499
about the technical talks we've had two

13
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:22,869
talks a month for the past eight years

14
00:01:19,499 --> 00:01:25,719
and we focus on the technical side of

15
00:01:22,869 --> 00:01:27,280
things and we appreciate people so many

16
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:33,068
talks to us and getting an opportunity

17
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:36,009
to speak whether they're new so we have

18
00:01:33,069 --> 00:01:39,130
some great talks lined up tonight we

19
00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:40,539
have Dan Kennedy and Silvio and we're

20
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:42,670
going to finish up with a bit of a

21
00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:46,029
closing ceremony for the B science

22
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:48,249
Canberra 2020 that never happened but I

23
00:01:46,029 --> 00:01:52,359
think first off we'll kick off with with

24
00:01:48,249 --> 00:01:54,130
dan dan kennedy and then isn't one for

25
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:57,939
introduction so and I said I'll entry

26
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:59,829
you here was nice but we will do would

27
00:01:57,939 --> 00:02:02,708
you do a small entry so Danny is

28
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:04,538
currently a senior threat analyst at

29
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:06,219
magic threat pursue team where he

30
00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:08,050
research his hunts and creates

31
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:11,590
adversarial tradecraft

32
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:15,040
emulation he also spoke at the first

33
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:17,530
besides camera back in 2016 which was

34
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:22,390
great and so I've been a long supporter

35
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:24,120
of besides camera and Seaside's yeah dan

36
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:30,399
would you like to start your screen

37
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:35,909
absolutely thank you guys and so great

38
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,909
to be back with the besides crew yes

39
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:43,540
screen I have to say during seaside I

40
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:47,370
was saying I normally sit down the back

41
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:47,370
of the room and let Sylvia just run it

42
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:54,870
say having the camera that's it cool

43
00:02:51,909 --> 00:02:57,519
excellent so I'm hoping that that's that

44
00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:01,180
screen looks good for everyone on the

45
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:05,560
street yeah that's great here awesome so

46
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:07,959
yeah just this talk today is purely just

47
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,669
to introduce a tool that I've been

48
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:13,450
working on for the past couple months

49
00:03:09,669 --> 00:03:15,519
now this this talk is yeah mainly an

50
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:19,108
introduction how do you know what it is

51
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:21,870
how to use it how to install it and

52
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:25,389
leave some of the more depth your

53
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:30,099
aspects of threat intelligence and

54
00:03:25,389 --> 00:03:33,639
analysis for for a later piece so with

55
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:35,349
that in mind otherwise I you know

56
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:37,449
obviously turned out like this guy on a

57
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:39,129
on a live stream which I try want to

58
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:42,970
avoid especially if I'm not getting pay

59
00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:46,690
for it but a bit about me so I'm a

60
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:49,329
senior analyst at Mannion within the

61
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:51,760
threat pursuit team so I mainly look at

62
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:54,599
commodity malware perform hunting

63
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:57,638
activities but my main focus has been

64
00:03:54,599 --> 00:04:00,280
adversarial emulation in my spare time

65
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:03,090
bitter jujitsu fitness and being a dad

66
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,859
which occupies almost all my spare time

67
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:07,629
yeah and I love what I do and and I

68
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:11,069
think I'd you know love to continue

69
00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:15,548
doing this sort of thing into the future

70
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:19,269
so with that with that in mind the the

71
00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:22,360
basis for the VM is to run on a Windows

72
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:25,930
environment there are plans to make that

73
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,219
into a Linux based version so we're

74
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,479
aiming to get that towards the end of

75
00:04:27,219 --> 00:04:30,400
end of this year

76
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:33,460
but it's primarily focused towards cyber

77
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,529
threat intelligence so design you know

78
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:38,830
for your blue teamers for your analysts

79
00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:43,058
and even students to have sort of a neat

80
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:47,409
neat tooling ready to use and easy to

81
00:04:43,059 --> 00:04:51,129
sort of install and move around so the

82
00:04:47,409 --> 00:04:54,879
video itself for me was was I felt was

83
00:04:51,129 --> 00:04:57,930
filling a gap that I saw wasn't really

84
00:04:54,879 --> 00:05:02,139
being met and so I felt that you know

85
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:03,430
we're starting to move into a an area

86
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:06,370
where we you know we're obviously

87
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:09,069
dominated by data and we need to be able

88
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:11,830
to discern that data to find evil in

89
00:05:09,069 --> 00:05:13,599
sort of better and clever ways so for me

90
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:15,878
it's you know these points on the slide

91
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:19,089
kind of the key themes or the drivers

92
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:22,779
for me to create this video so I can

93
00:05:19,089 --> 00:05:25,509
enable others to both you know hunt

94
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:29,129
share their information in in better

95
00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:34,930
ways and to help you know guide inform

96
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:36,399
you know decision makers the sort of

97
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:38,259
problem areas that we're looking at

98
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:40,749
forth for the reasoning for this VM

99
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:42,699
which is what I've sort of observed

100
00:05:40,749 --> 00:05:44,560
through feedback from different

101
00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:46,930
organizations different users different

102
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,089
analysts and they all have sort of the

103
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:51,699
key themes around you know the scope and

104
00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:55,060
the resources and you know the cost to

105
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:57,279
associate with some certain feeds and

106
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:59,740
that's all fair game but essentially

107
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:02,289
this tool provides you with you know

108
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:04,629
some open sources so that you can click

109
00:06:02,289 --> 00:06:07,659
pull back from a large range of

110
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:09,999
different providers but also give you

111
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:13,719
the sort of tool sets to be able to to

112
00:06:09,999 --> 00:06:15,639
do that so and the other reason

113
00:06:13,719 --> 00:06:18,370
obviously is the you know evil is

114
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:19,870
increasing so you know in terms of the

115
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:22,120
rate especially there's the last couple

116
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:24,249
of weeks we've covered 19 base themes

117
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,770
that is that has just been extraordinary

118
00:06:24,249 --> 00:06:29,949
and obviously emote it up it up until

119
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:32,020
that point and obviously the variants E

120
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:33,249
as well so they're coming in hard and

121
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:35,680
fast they're changing quite quickly

122
00:06:33,249 --> 00:06:38,110
there's new new samples new things each

123
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,650
and every day I feel that it's important

124
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:44,050
to keep track and tabs tabs of those

125
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:48,010
the sort of lifecycle of some of those

126
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:49,330
of malware and actors and obviously to

127
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:52,090
use and leverage that information

128
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:54,190
further to you know support and guide

129
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:56,380
how you know you can potentially

130
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:58,120
anticipate and respond to you know

131
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:01,360
future scenarios that you've observed in

132
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,919
other areas so taking for example you

133
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,300
may have seen some indicators from a

134
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:06,760
particular country targeting this

135
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,139
industry vertical so being able to sort

136
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,539
of consume that Intel quite quickly

137
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:13,060
rapidly and then develop sort of

138
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:15,539
signatures and apply those you know you

139
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:17,740
know in a quick in a quick manner I

140
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:19,360
through the attribution line in there I

141
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,860
know it's sort of always a contested

142
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,660
point but it's becoming more and more

143
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:24,310
important not just from a law

144
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:28,500
enforcement perspective but also from

145
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:31,870
sort of a regulatory perspective as well

146
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:34,000
demarcation so the VM itself is

147
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:36,760
primarily focused towards threat

148
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,820
intelligence so it should not be used

149
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:41,110
for Incident Response it's a different

150
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:44,409
methodologies it's a different mindset

151
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:47,410
completely reverse engineering there is

152
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:49,450
some re tools built into into the

153
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:52,240
toolset so mainly for static analysis

154
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:54,669
but obviously flare VM exists for that

155
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:58,240
very purpose so you know keep those guys

156
00:07:54,669 --> 00:07:59,770
up for for email we needs and obviously

157
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,110
the offensive security space you've got

158
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:07,080
commando VM so this just sits in that

159
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:11,889
same same family and is the sort of the

160
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:14,260
the the lonely child to a degree but I

161
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:16,690
love it so yeah we'll keep on with with

162
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:19,949
the threat pursuit VM the hardware

163
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:22,570
prereqs now this is a pretty beefy box

164
00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:24,190
it can be installed not just in a

165
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:28,240
virtualized sense but on a physical box

166
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:30,969
as well but you know inside a VM there

167
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:34,330
are quite a few tools that go into

168
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:38,370
shortly but you will need a pretty high

169
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:40,630
specs box to run that especially the

170
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:43,150
graphics card and the virtualization

171
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:46,350
counters enabled so that you can take

172
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:48,520
advantage of some of the docker based

173
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:51,820
containers and and they're in their

174
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:54,010
requirements the minimum spec will just

175
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,690
get you by so you'd be looking maybe at

176
00:08:54,010 --> 00:09:01,170
running one or two application

177
00:08:55,690 --> 00:09:04,149
inside this inside with some avian so

178
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:06,839
with with the collection side so when I

179
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:09,130
think of obviously what we do as analyst

180
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:12,100
whether we're you know addressing a

181
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:15,880
particular need or a problem we're

182
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:18,459
validating a narrative it's important

183
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:21,700
for us to sort of work with in a in a

184
00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:23,619
lifecycle and so with regards to

185
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:26,350
collection you can either take the

186
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:29,620
targeted perspective where you're

187
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:33,790
looking at you know a specific problem

188
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:36,820
or or an indicator versus you know bulk

189
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:39,279
you know scraping and pulling back so

190
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:42,010
you just have to be mindful of what your

191
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,660
approach is what your needs are but

192
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:45,899
essentially this tool should be able to

193
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:51,790
cover one or more of these these areas

194
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:54,640
quite well so just this is just a note

195
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:55,990
around like you can have a tool but if

196
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,699
you don't have the right mind so if you

197
00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:00,880
don't have the right sort of practice

198
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:03,399
then all methodology then the tools kind

199
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,290
of meaningless and I feel that a good

200
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:07,329
analyst will will have will ask the

201
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:09,699
tough questions on things so whether

202
00:10:07,329 --> 00:10:13,229
it's a finished intelligence report and

203
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:17,770
you're looking at I guess

204
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:20,350
certain inferences made from that

205
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:22,569
reporting so you know that for example

206
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:24,579
the victimology or the targeting you may

207
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:26,279
want to ask some tougher questions or is

208
00:10:24,579 --> 00:10:29,109
that do we really agree with that

209
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:32,260
component is the technical analysis

210
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:34,839
correct what are the gaps and what today

211
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:36,579
what did that report miss it's just

212
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:38,529
important to kind of you know ask those

213
00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:40,209
questions but also and on the right-hand

214
00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:41,920
side you've got an example of the

215
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:44,529
diamond model an image from threat

216
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,709
connect and it's just a way for you to

217
00:10:44,529 --> 00:10:50,680
have that analytical mindset and pivot

218
00:10:47,709 --> 00:10:52,390
from different aspects for for something

219
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,060
that you've seen so if you're working on

220
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:57,459
or you're supporting an investigation

221
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:58,660
and you want to provide a level of Intel

222
00:10:57,459 --> 00:11:01,479
or intelligence lead

223
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:05,699
you may look may choose to use something

224
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:09,060
like a diamond model to infer or differ

225
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:13,359
certain parts of information

226
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:19,359
so if the stash this is the the part I

227
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:21,279
guess everyone loves so yep quite a

228
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,680
quite a few things here on the left-hand

229
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,970
side collection entry arch obviously

230
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,269
some things you'd be quite familiar with

231
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:31,120
others you may not necessary but miss

232
00:11:28,269 --> 00:11:33,370
and open CTI excuse me would be the sort

233
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,350
of key key components that I use for

234
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:38,470
example to to bowl to collect

235
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:40,690
information and then drill into but

236
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:42,519
obviously this is just a subset of what

237
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:47,230
actually exists in the tool there's

238
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:49,690
there's many more providers that so so

239
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:52,149
so Poland is in there as well they've

240
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:54,699
created a really neat tool and have

241
00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:57,699
indexed quite a large range of of

242
00:11:54,699 --> 00:11:59,500
malware tools called M query and I'll

243
00:11:57,699 --> 00:12:01,540
show you show you guys that a little bit

244
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:04,870
later but a good way to hunt for for

245
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:07,449
other samples the analytics and data is

246
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:12,130
probably where the you know look at the

247
00:12:07,449 --> 00:12:13,839
core focus has been and this these tool

248
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:20,100
sets are primarily geared towards

249
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:23,860
applying Suzi analytical models into

250
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:25,510
across data to sort of discern that for

251
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:27,639
for something that you might be looking

252
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:29,529
at so there are some components here

253
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:31,360
that a sort of machine machine learning

254
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:34,540
focused I don't allow you to build and

255
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,819
develop and train models to apply across

256
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:39,819
your data set but also to sort of

257
00:12:36,819 --> 00:12:42,699
leverage from two to check or verify

258
00:12:39,819 --> 00:12:44,949
your hypothesis for hunting so for

259
00:12:42,699 --> 00:12:47,829
example the threat hunter playbook has

260
00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:50,589
some pretty good examples there of of

261
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:52,810
events in indicators that you could use

262
00:12:50,589 --> 00:12:56,740
to then hunt for across your own data

263
00:12:52,810 --> 00:13:00,279
sets so then you've also got Jupiter and

264
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:03,069
Zeppelin which kind of notebooks used as

265
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:06,399
as interpreters for for data so that you

266
00:13:03,069 --> 00:13:08,709
can model and classify information quite

267
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,440
quickly but you also have Splunk and elk

268
00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:14,349
in there so quite quite a bit to play

269
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:17,260
and leverage from the adversarial

270
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:20,319
emulation so the two that stood out for

271
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:22,730
me most were my de caldera and the

272
00:13:20,319 --> 00:13:25,250
atomic red team by red canary

273
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:28,399
and this is primarily focused towards

274
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:30,139
running a mission in the offensive sense

275
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:33,980
and then pulling the event information

276
00:13:30,139 --> 00:13:36,079
back from from your emulations into your

277
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:39,110
you're logging platform so you can drill

278
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:41,660
into so that that's the kind of key or

279
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:43,880
why that that exists inside the platform

280
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:45,560
as well is to leverage the domain

281
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:49,760
expertise in the offensive security

282
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:51,138
space and bring that closer to the blue

283
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,870
team

284
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:55,490
some users that are in there so the ones

285
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:58,670
that are not mentioned here would be

286
00:13:55,490 --> 00:14:01,699
things like floss X or search like

287
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:05,540
string search if a whole bunch of UNIX

288
00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:08,269
tools and flare flare VM binaries that

289
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:10,939
are included in there as well as well as

290
00:14:08,269 --> 00:14:13,910
some virtualization I was excuse me

291
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:17,060
visualization tool so constellations CD

292
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:18,589
escape and neo4j yes and these are just

293
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:20,300
like the ones that I wanted to show on

294
00:14:18,589 --> 00:14:23,320
on one slide there's there's quite a bit

295
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,319
more behind the scenes

296
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:31,660
the types of insource so this is

297
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:34,240
obviously the only tenant install from

298
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:37,029
source and the customized install from

299
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:40,210
source so the the ones that we we

300
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:42,160
recommend now you do and use but however

301
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:46,000
for the purposes of today's presentation

302
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:48,069
I've included a VM file that's just been

303
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:59,560
freshly built and that you can use to as

304
00:14:48,070 --> 00:15:02,860
a preview version the unattended install

305
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:05,709
so to run this tool obviously you would

306
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:08,500
need to have your vm already prepared

307
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:11,170
you can if you don't you can grab a VM

308
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:13,480
file from the windows developer website

309
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:18,550
and you can think it's around 60 days

310
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:21,250
trial evaluation period and then run run

311
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:22,870
a PowerShell script to remotely execute

312
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:24,130
and download all the packages I'll go

313
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:27,279
through the install process with you

314
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:29,370
closely the customized install which is

315
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:32,620
what I recommend this is where you would

316
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:34,779
essentially modify the profile block

317
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:37,990
JSON file and remove the packages that

318
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:40,000
you don't need or we use and that way

319
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:42,010
you can have sort of a smaller install

320
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,459
base because it is quite a lengthy

321
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:51,150
process a lot of pictures get installed

322
00:15:45,459 --> 00:15:51,150
as a result demo install

323
00:15:54,170 --> 00:16:14,050
I think the display might change yeah

324
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,930
you

325
00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:26,609
to

326
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,020
you

327
00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:40,589
always happens on

328
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,589
nice too

329
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:50,099
come on okay so I'm just going to change

330
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:50,100
the resolution so everyone can see

331
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,869
you

332
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:55,189
you

333
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:02,319
all right the demo install so I'll just

334
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:04,389
run through that this is obviously a

335
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:08,800
pre-built VM that I've just created for

336
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:15,370
the purposes of today but I'll go

337
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:18,119
through the unattended install how a

338
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:18,119
hell that's right

339
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:41,530
install cool so we got our neat ASCII

340
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:44,199
art some requirements here so you do

341
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:46,570
need to have obviously an updated

342
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,700
patched recently patched windows version

343
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:51,250
it's just a check that we put into in

344
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,809
the Installer you can choose to take a

345
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,290
snapshot or not you won't need to take a

346
00:17:52,809 --> 00:17:57,520
snapshot

347
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:59,200
I don't think and before installing you

348
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,100
will pump in your credentials that you

349
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:06,160
need and this is to handle the the

350
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:07,809
install the reboot operations but

351
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,440
essentially we'll just throw in anything

352
00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:14,550
here just for the purposes so we use box

353
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:20,440
tada which allows us to bootstrap the

354
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:24,100
installation so all it is is a controls

355
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:25,809
the reboot operations of the install and

356
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,550
you know checks which packages are in

357
00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:29,710
saw which ones are not are they an

358
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:33,220
updated you know is that package still

359
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:35,470
available is it not we just leverage

360
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:38,020
bootstrap the packages and the cells are

361
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:38,770
downloaded from a distribution point

362
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:42,580
cords

363
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:46,389
meigan the packages themselves written

364
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:48,879
in XML which essentially a reference

365
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:50,679
point to the originating distributors

366
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,750
the vendors of and the original authors

367
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:55,090
so from github or from a vendors website

368
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:57,190
and it attaches their the licensing

369
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:59,139
arrangements and the description the

370
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:01,420
authors and things of that nature so we

371
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:03,309
preserve all that information and we

372
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:07,059
just simply download the binary from the

373
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:10,600
branding site what we do do though is we

374
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:13,450
ensure that the the downloaded binary

375
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:15,250
from the site is the hash same hash as

376
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:17,500
as the distribution provided to that

377
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:20,170
version and so we have checks in place

378
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:23,140
to make sure that the binary hasn't been

379
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:26,320
modified or altered in any way based on

380
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:29,760
the the hash checksum that that it

381
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:32,950
returns so rest assured those packages

382
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:36,640
have not been tainted in any malicious

383
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:39,110
way by anyone so yeah that's the that's

384
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:41,150
the theory list so I

385
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:43,040
go ahead and kill this because that is

386
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:45,650
that is the install that will just run

387
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:47,270
for about three hours download all the

388
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:54,429
packages do a couple of reboots and

389
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:57,139
you'll end up with this this desktop so

390
00:19:54,429 --> 00:19:58,910
with the desktop we'll just do a bit of

391
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:01,160
a drive around I'll show you a couple of

392
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:03,470
things where to find things and then

393
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:06,559
kind of leave you guys on your way to to

394
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:09,650
hunt stuff so I guess first things first

395
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:11,480
is you've got some shortcuts so these

396
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:13,580
will just refer you to some online sound

397
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,919
boxes that you can use you can use to

398
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:18,740
both check your samples but also pull

399
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:25,520
back samples and as well as a tech

400
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:29,390
navigator to go into that to do to show

401
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:33,100
you sort of if you like the tactics and

402
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:35,179
techniques sort of matrices of of

403
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:38,959
information here that you might want to

404
00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:41,390
leverage as part of your reporting but

405
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,179
let's not get into that so we're going

406
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:47,419
to Google Chrome we have some shortcuts

407
00:20:44,179 --> 00:20:49,549
here I've added in now bookmarks and so

408
00:20:47,419 --> 00:20:52,309
from here you can find additional IC

409
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:55,549
sources that you can that you can pull

410
00:20:52,309 --> 00:20:58,129
back from and contribute to you have

411
00:20:55,549 --> 00:21:00,530
some other Intel feed providers these

412
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:02,660
are mostly free in with limited use is

413
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:07,100
my understanding but you can sign up and

414
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:09,740
register and and actively check and find

415
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:11,540
things you have some you haven't always

416
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:13,730
seen stack here which is more or less

417
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:15,260
than on untechnical but there are some

418
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:18,380
references to datasets that you can

419
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:20,419
leverage from such as census and you

420
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:22,270
have bitcoin forensics so if you want to

421
00:21:20,419 --> 00:21:25,280
do some checkup some wallets you want to

422
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:28,309
obviously keep tabs on transactions and

423
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:30,980
you can you can do so here and just some

424
00:21:28,309 --> 00:21:33,980
networking tools that are driven from

425
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:36,500
websites if if that if that is your that

426
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:38,750
is your thing so that's the that's the

427
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:42,950
shortcuts no need to go further into

428
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:44,870
that you have a tools folder in the

429
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:47,059
tools folder which is just a shortcut

430
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:48,709
it'll have some groupings of the

431
00:21:47,059 --> 00:21:50,990
different tool sets that you can go and

432
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:52,700
drill through there's quite a bit there

433
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:53,990
as you can see and this is you know

434
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:59,440
obviously ground zero for this

435
00:21:53,990 --> 00:22:02,050
particular VM the plan is to obviously

436
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:06,170
continually update and improve that

437
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:08,210
getting feedback from the community so

438
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:12,110
yep they're all there they mainly just

439
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:15,770
point to a directory in CTools and so

440
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:21,320
within here we have basically the bulk

441
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:25,790
of of of our data and our tool sets so

442
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:27,590
yeah as I mentioned the docker it's

443
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:29,840
quite docker dependent and for certain

444
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:34,340
things so I'm just gonna go ahead and

445
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:35,840
just make sure that this is still up and

446
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:37,610
running yep so I've got the malware

447
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,790
information sharing platform running

448
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:42,229
inside this VM as well as other tools so

449
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:44,270
we're just going to go and have a look

450
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:46,820
around there see what we can see what we

451
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:49,210
can find just kind of a sort of a short

452
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,210
workflow

453
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:24,519
oh my god I swear that's what I put in

454
00:23:18,809 --> 00:23:26,830
fat fingers maybe yep so now we're

455
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:30,779
information sharing platform what I want

456
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:33,428
to do is go into the feeds so obviously

457
00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:35,769
there are quite a lot of communities

458
00:23:33,429 --> 00:23:38,409
it's still growing as I suppose but

459
00:23:35,769 --> 00:23:40,269
there's quite a lot of community that

460
00:23:38,409 --> 00:23:44,169
exists currently that actively

461
00:23:40,269 --> 00:23:46,029
contribute via the MIS platform so I

462
00:23:44,169 --> 00:23:49,090
won't go obviously into the depth of

463
00:23:46,029 --> 00:23:52,210
this but um I highly recommend every

464
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:53,738
start using it the reason is that it

465
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:55,539
provides a good way to both collect

466
00:23:53,739 --> 00:23:58,359
information which is what I primarily

467
00:23:55,539 --> 00:24:02,200
use it for now but also to sort of model

468
00:23:58,359 --> 00:24:04,539
and tag and verify things and contribute

469
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,850
back so it provides a nice sort of neat

470
00:24:04,539 --> 00:24:08,799
package way to do that and we'll just go

471
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:15,369
and remotely view the events that found

472
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:16,749
this provider is willing to share and we

473
00:24:15,369 --> 00:24:19,209
see some cool stuff here but this is

474
00:24:16,749 --> 00:24:21,539
obviously pretty old so just filter by

475
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:21,539
the day

476
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:31,210
so again this is pretty old but in any

477
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:35,800
case for the purposes we'll have a look

478
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:38,050
at REM cups so these are these are the

479
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:41,830
tags that have been applied by analysts

480
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:43,840
and from this organization so we maybe

481
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:46,720
want to go and just check whether that's

482
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:50,129
complete whether that's correct whether

483
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:52,540
we agree with the the attribution or not

484
00:24:50,130 --> 00:25:01,840
attribution in the sense of the the

485
00:24:52,540 --> 00:25:04,149
malware malware family okay so the cool

486
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,520
thing is we've got like a pretty well

487
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:08,890
structured data set here we've got some

488
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:10,650
artifacts dropped as a result of the

489
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:14,470
execution of the malware this is

490
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:16,890
inferred from this provider or perhaps

491
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:19,330
written in their in their blog post

492
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:21,190
they've got some see two domains my P

493
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:23,500
addresses here and they've also listed

494
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:27,600
the the phase of the attack lifecycle

495
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:31,930
that that was at that particular

496
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:35,949
artifact was observed in and we've got

497
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:39,040
some payloads so he's calling it payload

498
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:42,730
delivery payload delivery and payload

499
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:45,460
deliveries so we're going just do a

500
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:48,150
quick check of that hash so we'll have a

501
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,150
look at the md5

502
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:51,730
you

503
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:57,260
it's going to a penny run

504
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:08,800
we've got like a quick link to a sandbox

505
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:15,520
that we can go and verify the sample if

506
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:18,030
you like or I will submit I agree to

507
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,030
your cookies

508
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:22,110
pop that hash in

509
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:32,450
if we've got any known samples not in a

510
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:35,660
penny run if all else fails she's going

511
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:38,810
to Google throw that in I've got a link

512
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:40,580
here for Joe sandbox another sandbox

513
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:42,860
online actually these guys are quite

514
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:45,159
good now they they do create rules on

515
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:45,159
the fly

516
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:54,610
and I suppose once this report comes up

517
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:56,139
we can go through and look in-depth the

518
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:59,350
different characteristics of the file

519
00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:03,010
such as the execution behavior the

520
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:06,189
signatures more or less but we also want

521
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:09,580
to you know potentially take some of

522
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:13,679
additional mitre attack tagging there or

523
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:15,850
the make them figure out what makes

524
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:18,580
abbreviation stands for but it's another

525
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:20,830
mitre attack or might have framework and

526
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:24,100
way classification which is probably

527
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:25,928
more appropriate for malware and then

528
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,939
we've got some other other information

529
00:27:25,929 --> 00:27:31,480
here such as the CTO callbacks and

530
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:33,429
whatnot but that's that's okay met

531
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,080
perhaps we could not find a sample so

532
00:27:33,429 --> 00:27:36,610
from Joe's sandbox we could download the

533
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:40,449
sample and triage that a little bit

534
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:43,209
further but let's say for example we

535
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:45,460
only have a a yarol to work from and we

536
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:48,730
want to find how many other samples a

537
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:52,720
hit from that yarrow so I've stolen a

538
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:55,840
are or hereby from Florian Roth thanks

539
00:27:52,720 --> 00:28:00,130
Florian and what it's going to do is

540
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:02,949
look for what he searched to be mini

541
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:08,230
cats or Safety cats executed or decoded

542
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:10,419
from a figure and obviously the actor

543
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:13,809
has been using cert you tool to encrypt

544
00:28:10,419 --> 00:28:15,850
and decrypt a module of whatever it was

545
00:28:13,809 --> 00:28:19,779
they dropped on that floor Ian's been

546
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:22,260
looking at so I'm going to go into M

547
00:28:19,779 --> 00:28:22,260
query

548
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:28,879
so I've cheated a little bit and I've

549
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:31,220
already pumped in Florian's query and

550
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,740
that's come back with some matches here

551
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:37,310
so there is an API that you can they can

552
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:39,560
go and heat up but yeah em query was

553
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:43,370
created from cert Poland and it contains

554
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:46,250
an index of 1.6 million samples so

555
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:48,290
highly highly recommend it to use it and

556
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:51,110
yeah got a couple of samples here that

557
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:53,780
we can go and take the binary I just

558
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:55,159
download download that obviously try not

559
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:57,560
to execute it but it's probably just

560
00:28:55,160 --> 00:29:01,370
gonna have some P headers in Windows

561
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:03,710
functions of mini cats in there so I'm

562
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:06,199
not not too worried I don't really feel

563
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:08,810
like going through it today but yeah

564
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:11,660
it's you know a good way to to kind of

565
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:14,600
hunt for information so that you can

566
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:18,440
sort of validate and verify whether you

567
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:19,550
agree it's truthful or not there's some

568
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,990
other things that are in here obviously

569
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:22,639
you could do that with on the Cape

570
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:26,450
sandbox as well I think I actually

571
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:29,450
submitted this file already yeah we've

572
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:30,950
got some Yara rule hits here that we can

573
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:34,480
also leverage and pull the reporting

574
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:37,910
back for and tag that up in in misc

575
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:41,090
obviously cabaña is also running so I've

576
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:42,440
just taken an apt 29 dataset from the

577
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:48,320
thread hunters playbook and pumped that

578
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:51,260
into into cabaña so yep everything seems

579
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,490
to be running pretty well on this VM and

580
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:54,920
I'm just going to do like a quick

581
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:57,430
visualization across the whole data set

582
00:29:54,920 --> 00:30:00,050
I'm just looking for my key event IDs

583
00:29:57,430 --> 00:30:03,620
process like vs. are a parent process

584
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:05,659
IDs and different threads obviously this

585
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:07,669
is like you need to drill into this

586
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:10,670
information a little bit more but just

587
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:12,290
provides a good way to obviously callate

588
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:14,560
large amounts of data and start

589
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:19,129
scrutinizing it a little bit further

590
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:22,060
Splunk also exists in this tool I just

591
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:22,060
I'll just bring that up

592
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:34,300
- to take a little bit

593
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:36,429
you

594
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:42,759
[Music]

595
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:59,360
I find if you print it press into there

596
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,540
like three times and then decides to

597
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,540
work

598
00:31:05,779 --> 00:31:08,049
time

599
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:14,850
cool

600
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:22,800
course I'm sure

601
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:24,679
like everyone has almost people have had

602
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:27,480
a look at Splunk and/or elk

603
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:29,190
elasticsearch if you haven't liked

604
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:32,070
definitely definitely go for it you can

605
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:34,500
get access to those inside this tool as

606
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:35,730
well as from those providers there's a

607
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,290
whole bunch of training material on how

608
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:39,270
to use that from them as well

609
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:41,309
I highly recommend the advanced hunting

610
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:43,950
apts with Splunk if you're new to

611
00:31:41,309 --> 00:31:46,410
hunting and that sort of thing

612
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:48,150
but yeah so essentially you can you know

613
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:50,190
run your boss of the stock in here as

614
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:51,840
well other data sets as long as they're

615
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:53,130
indexed and you're using it

616
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:56,580
appropriately with the terms and

617
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:58,410
conditions of the of the vendor and then

618
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:00,780
you know obviously start querying away

619
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:04,040
for your data I won't go into that

620
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:04,040
because I'm running a bit short on time

621
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:15,220
actually how am i doing on time Kylie

622
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:15,220
Silvia have no idea

623
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:30,370
are you four people go alright nice well

624
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:32,600
what I'll do is I'll go through caldera

625
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:34,929
actually I might go through Jupiter

626
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,929
notebook

627
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:45,299
so Jupiter notebook is essentially just

628
00:32:40,889 --> 00:32:47,459
like a Python interpreter for creating

629
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:50,179
queries so for example I would you

630
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:53,129
probably use this if I was looking at

631
00:32:50,179 --> 00:32:56,789
and I'd like some sort of IDs log or

632
00:32:53,129 --> 00:32:58,408
something quite quite small you know and

633
00:32:56,789 --> 00:33:00,840
I wanted to get some quick information

634
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:03,149
out of it without necessarily creating

635
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:07,168
those queries or indexing indexing that

636
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:11,399
information it might be limited to a

637
00:33:07,169 --> 00:33:15,320
sharing problem or that sort of thing so

638
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:18,959
I've actually created a I've prepared a

639
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:23,220
query based on the model data set which

640
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,809
is in ctools Mordor data sets which has

641
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:26,789
like as I mentioned sort of a whole

642
00:33:24,809 --> 00:33:29,970
range of files there that have already

643
00:33:26,789 --> 00:33:35,239
been taken from an adversarial emulation

644
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:37,320
and so with this obviously you'll need

645
00:33:35,239 --> 00:33:40,230
pandas and pity which is which has

646
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:43,350
already been included for you and that

647
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:45,840
will allow you to obviously look at data

648
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:47,609
you know in a structured way so in this

649
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:50,399
example all have been all I'm looking at

650
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:53,399
is event information and I want to see

651
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:57,090
the highest count so I can drill into

652
00:33:53,399 --> 00:34:00,330
particular process IDs or event IDs and

653
00:33:57,090 --> 00:34:02,759
then I've got a nice neat ordered view

654
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:04,918
of what those events the key events are

655
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:07,010
that have the highest count I can also

656
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:09,780
tailor this query to then look into

657
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:14,510
obviously the the the payloads that are

658
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:17,069
attached to that inside the event data

659
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:20,040
so yeah that's that's essentially for

660
00:34:17,069 --> 00:34:24,449
the tool there's quite a bit quite a bit

661
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:26,879
more to it but um yeah that's that's

662
00:34:24,449 --> 00:34:36,388
kind of kind of it for the introduction

663
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:43,049
you don't want to know how many times in

664
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:45,059
practice that cleft fantastic very much

665
00:34:43,049 --> 00:34:48,859
we actually do you have some questions

666
00:34:45,059 --> 00:34:51,690
on the social media

667
00:34:48,859 --> 00:34:54,359
so one question it was asked why someone

668
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:57,559
the slack was can they get popular links

669
00:34:54,359 --> 00:35:00,359
from the selecting if that's possible

670
00:34:57,559 --> 00:35:04,579
yeah absolutely we'll post it into a

671
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:08,098
size chat the download of the VM and the

672
00:35:04,579 --> 00:35:10,770
the installation script will be hosted

673
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:12,359
on a get github page at fire but that

674
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:14,549
hasn't been released yet I had need to

675
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:17,009
just check what the status is of that I

676
00:35:14,549 --> 00:35:18,599
think it's just a time zone problem but

677
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:20,520
you will have access to the VM to

678
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:22,319
download and run that as a preview so

679
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:27,900
we'll make sure that that gets posted in

680
00:35:22,319 --> 00:35:33,869
this way and one more question in terms

681
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:36,059
of the social integration social media a

682
00:35:33,869 --> 00:35:37,440
leakage to that or social integration

683
00:35:36,059 --> 00:35:39,359
was one of the questions we've got all

684
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,849
the slack as well yeah absolutely

685
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:44,490
there's a whole range of always in

686
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:47,540
focused links to websites that are there

687
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:52,799
and so do drill do drill through those

688
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:55,490
they will relate to sort of linked

689
00:35:52,799 --> 00:36:00,869
LinkedIn profiles and sort of first

690
00:35:55,490 --> 00:36:04,109
social persona related data or websites

691
00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:06,690
that quote those sources so I can

692
00:36:04,109 --> 00:36:08,970
definitely recommend people go through

693
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:11,520
and and based on whatever need they have

694
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:13,078
social media is such a broad area but

695
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:17,160
there is there is quite a few links

696
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:20,869
