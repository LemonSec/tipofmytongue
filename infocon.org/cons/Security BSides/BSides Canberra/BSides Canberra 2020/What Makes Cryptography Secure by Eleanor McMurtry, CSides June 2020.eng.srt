1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,920
all right is that Tim it looks great

2
00:00:08,269 --> 00:00:14,429
okay I don't know what's happened but

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,970
anyway um so I'm a Masters of Science

4
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:19,289
candidate at the University of Melbourne

5
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:21,029
studying applied crypto it's a master of

6
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:22,769
computer science it's all a little bit

7
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:24,750
fuzzy but I'm having a good time and

8
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:28,320
that's the main thing if you want to

9
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:31,320
contact me this is my little CV so you

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,120
can also reach me on Twitter here so ask

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,710
cryptographers tend to be a little bit

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,860
of a theatrical Bunch

13
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:40,980
so I've decided that my talk will be

14
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:43,920
separated into three acts and the first

15
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:46,260
one is a tale of two families two

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,800
households both alike in dignity in fair

17
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:52,170
Canberra where we lay our scene we have

18
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,849
Ellis and we have Bob they want to talk

19
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,610
to each other but their families hate

20
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,350
each other so it needs to be a secret am

21
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:01,320
I gonna look at how you can keep a

22
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:03,239
secret in the digital age so they want

23
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,129
to say hello to each other but it needs

24
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:07,830
to be a secret so we're gonna hide their

25
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:11,310
message make it look like this hopefully

26
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:13,320
no one else can read that so we're gonna

27
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:16,290
get started what is a crypto system well

28
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,179
first you have to generate some keys you

29
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,100
may have an asymmetric cryptosystem

30
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,930
where one key encrypts and the other

31
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,689
decrypt will return to that idea later

32
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:27,210
or you may just have one secret key for

33
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:28,889
a symmetric system now you also need to

34
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,169
be able to encrypt a message with the

35
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:34,530
relevant key and we call an encrypted

36
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,759
message a ciphertext finally you need to

37
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,340
be able to decrypt that message

38
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,549
otherwise it's not a very useful crypto

39
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,110
system so you can recover the ciphertext

40
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:45,210
you can recover the message from the

41
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:49,020
ciphertext but only if you have the

42
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:51,720
secret key well hopefully so we would

43
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:54,390
like it if a crypto system can't be

44
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:57,420
broken and we say that a crypto system

45
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:59,759
is information theoretic secure if no

46
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,950
one nor adversary can recover the

47
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,680
message unless they have the secret key

48
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,180
so this is what we would like and let's

49
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,420
take a look at one way you can do this

50
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:11,430
an example you have a secret key not a

51
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,350
nor don't use this as your password but

52
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:17,400
just for sake of example if you

53
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:19,739
the secret key ABCDE you can use bitwise

54
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,380
XOR you XOR these two strings together

55
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,460
and you get an apparently random this is

56
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,960
in hexadecimal

57
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:27,780
you're gonna map and an apparently

58
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:30,150
random sequence of bytes as output and

59
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,550
it's information theoretic secure this

60
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,620
scheme satisfies that really strong

61
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,840
notion of security that we'd like and

62
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,240
that's because if you don't know the

63
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,880
secret key you have no idea what message

64
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:44,310
it is I could if I thought the secret

65
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:46,560
key was this string instead of ABCDE I

66
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:49,440
would get out the string the message

67
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,870
frogs but it was not frogs it was hello

68
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,630
so it's information theoretic secure

69
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:56,640
because you have no way to know which

70
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:58,530
actual message was used you have you can

71
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,170
only do it if you've got the secret key

72
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:03,830
so that seems pretty nice why don't we

73
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:06,660
all use information theoretic schemes

74
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:08,160
unfortunately first of all no asymmetric

75
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,470
cryptosystem can be information

76
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,180
theoretic secure now this is a theorem

77
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,980
of cryptography I'm not going to go

78
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,770
through it is quite quite a long and

79
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:19,140
involved discussion about that but if

80
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:21,930
you want to if you want to have a public

81
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:23,429
key that you don't already agree so if

82
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:25,020
you want to have a public key that

83
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,550
everyone knows you don't have to already

84
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,860
agree on a secret key you don't have to

85
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:31,440
meet up somewhere and say hey this is my

86
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:33,270
secret key don't tell anyone so that's

87
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,890
that's not ideal you we like and

88
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:36,780
symmetric cryptography and again we'll

89
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:39,059
come back to that later but it gets

90
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,100
worse if you want your crypto system to

91
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,470
be information theoretic secure the

92
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:46,290
secret key has to be at least as long as

93
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:48,000
the longest message so you can't hurt to

94
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:50,190
have information theoretic security

95
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,010
unless your secret key is really really

96
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:54,450
long and I'm sure you can imagine why

97
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:57,450
that's problematic if you want to have

98
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:59,670
if you want to share say a two gigabyte

99
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:01,440
file that maybe some authorities would

100
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:04,109
not like you to share you need a two

101
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:06,780
gigabyte secret key it gets unwieldy and

102
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:08,970
it's it's not an ideal outcome

103
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:12,360
so unfortunately information theoretic

104
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:14,190
security is not really the goal must at

105
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,859
the time you can see these sad faces

106
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:20,850
they are not pleased about this this

107
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:24,690
moves us to Act two and in actually ask

108
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:26,620
are you feeling lucky so what we're

109
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:28,870
going to settle for we can't have

110
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:32,650
security we can never have this

111
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:35,050
situation where no one can recover the

112
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:36,638
message with that the secret key sorry

113
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:39,340
settle for something that's a little bit

114
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:43,240
weaker we call this computational

115
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:46,690
security and a system is computationally

116
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,669
secure if no efficient adversary one

117
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:50,830
that runs in a decent amount of time

118
00:04:48,669 --> 00:04:52,539
obviously you know if your adversary has

119
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,830
given a billion years so we don't really

120
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,050
care if they can break the system

121
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:58,840
because their sons gonna die before them

122
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:01,690
so we say it's computationally secure if

123
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:04,479
you can't do it efficiently unless

124
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:06,729
you're really lucky and this is this is

125
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,889
the get-out-of-jail-free that's gonna

126
00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:10,870
stop us from running into that problem

127
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:13,030
with information theoretic security

128
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:15,100
unless you're really really lucky

129
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:17,859
there's no way you can recover the

130
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,570
secret key and you may be wondering okay

131
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:22,180
well what is extremely lucky mean

132
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:23,860
luckily we've thought of that and this

133
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,240
is some massive stuff if you're not from

134
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,070
a massive background don't worry about

135
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,979
it the idea is we want the probability

136
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:32,229
to be negligible and that means smaller

137
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:35,080
than reciprocal any polynomial in other

138
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:37,599
words it goes to zero zero really really

139
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:40,240
quickly faster than any polynomial x

140
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:42,880
squared X cubed whatever you like so

141
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,060
we're gonna say if you're really lucky

142
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,919
sure I guess you can get the message but

143
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:51,180
you have to be extremely extraordinarily

144
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:54,490
lucky and we'll say that's good enough

145
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:57,250
so the next thing that we think about

146
00:05:54,490 --> 00:06:00,430
well okay we have this notion of

147
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:03,250
security we've agreed okay we can't have

148
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:05,260
no adversary recover the message we're

149
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:07,510
gonna settle for it being really

150
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:11,349
unlikely that they can grab the message

151
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:14,320
back out how do we prove that a system

152
00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:16,180
has this property and you know we can

153
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,610
make lots of strong arguments we can say

154
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,260
well look it's it has this thing and we

155
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:22,150
know that this is a hard problem to do

156
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:25,810
so they shouldn't be able to break it

157
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:28,210
right now a cryptography like myself or

158
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:30,849
photographer in training thanks for

159
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:33,969
themselves that's not good enough

160
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:37,000
we need a rock-solid proof we need a

161
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:38,940
strong convincing argument that our

162
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,689
system really does have this property

163
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,610
otherwise you know you can

164
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:44,499
think of all sorts of schemes that maybe

165
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,819
have the property but it's not good

166
00:06:44,499 --> 00:06:48,069
enough it's not good enough to protect

167
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:51,989
valuable secrets like your bank account

168
00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:54,399
or you know that's really embarrassing

169
00:06:51,989 --> 00:06:56,078
drunk party photos that you posted as a

170
00:06:54,399 --> 00:07:00,339
teenager we need something better than

171
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:02,349
that so we start to think about games

172
00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:05,259
the idea is the Challenger and the

173
00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:07,389
adversary are playing a game against

174
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:10,239
each other and the adversary wins this

175
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:12,249
game if they can break the system so

176
00:07:10,239 --> 00:07:15,159
we're going to play a game hopefully the

177
00:07:12,249 --> 00:07:17,979
adversary can't win let's see how we can

178
00:07:15,159 --> 00:07:20,379
we'll see how we go now one basic such

179
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:23,199
notion if alice is sending a message

180
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:26,079
that's either zero or one so one bit to

181
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,569
bomb someone watching them shouldn't be

182
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:30,759
able to work out which one Alice sent so

183
00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:32,110
you know Alice's sent one of the two you

184
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:34,809
shouldn't be able to work out which one

185
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:37,059
she sent that seems like a useful

186
00:07:34,809 --> 00:07:40,719
property to have let's look at how we

187
00:07:37,059 --> 00:07:42,479
can make that formal we call this the

188
00:07:40,719 --> 00:07:44,469
indistinguishability game or

189
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,329
indistinguishability under multiple

190
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:49,689
encryptions is an extension

191
00:07:46,329 --> 00:07:52,089
the idea is to ciphertexts remember an

192
00:07:49,689 --> 00:07:54,819
encrypted message to ciphertext should

193
00:07:52,089 --> 00:07:56,889
be really hard to tell apart or it

194
00:07:54,819 --> 00:08:00,399
should be hard to tell what corresponds

195
00:07:56,889 --> 00:08:03,639
to one so here's how we're going to do

196
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:05,679
this first of all our challenge and C is

197
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:07,149
gonna run the generation algorithm

198
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:09,578
they're going to generate a secret key

199
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:11,589
and the adversary is going to think of

200
00:08:09,579 --> 00:08:12,309
two messages they're going to say to the

201
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:14,439
Challenger

202
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:15,669
you're gonna encrypt one of these two I

203
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:17,439
don't know which but you're gonna

204
00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:19,179
encourage one of them and the Challenger

205
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:21,879
says yeah all right I'm gonna flip a

206
00:08:19,179 --> 00:08:24,008
coin if it comes up heads I'm gonna send

207
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:26,139
the first one encrypted if it comes up

208
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:29,199
tails I'll send the second one encrypted

209
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:29,709
and now the adversary has to guess which

210
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,318
one

211
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:34,629
the Challenger sent so clearly if they

212
00:08:32,318 --> 00:08:36,068
can if they can win this game reliably

213
00:08:34,629 --> 00:08:38,079
they have broken this

214
00:08:36,068 --> 00:08:40,539
indistinguishability property they can

215
00:08:38,078 --> 00:08:44,049
tell whether the challenge an encrypted

216
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:48,430
0 or 1 they can tell whether Ellis send

217
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:51,040
0 or 1 - Bob sir the way we're going to

218
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:52,689
think about this you know it's all well

219
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,150
and good to think about ok we want this

220
00:08:52,689 --> 00:08:56,790
game to be hard to win

221
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:58,949
but again we like to make it formal we

222
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:01,469
like to make it rigorous present a

223
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:02,100
convincing argument so what I'm gonna

224
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:04,529
say

225
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:06,540
if any polynomial time adversary and

226
00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:08,670
remember if it's not polynomial time it

227
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:11,160
takes forever so it doesn't matter if

228
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:13,620
any polynomial time inversor II has a

229
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,810
probability of less than 1/2 plus a

230
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,610
negligible amount now you might be

231
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:19,800
thinking didn't we wanted it to be

232
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:21,660
negligible well I mean think about it

233
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,490
right the adversary could just toss a

234
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:25,230
coin and half the time they're going to

235
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:27,810
happen to toss the same result as the

236
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:29,279
Challenger so as we say instead all

237
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:31,469
right they're always going to do at

238
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:33,630
least I've always got at least a 50/50

239
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:37,890
chance of guessing so we're gonna say

240
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:40,920
it's barely better than 50/50 and if any

241
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:43,199
adversary no matter was has no it has

242
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,300
only a tiny bit better than a 50/50 shot

243
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,150
at winning we say it's indistinguishable

244
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:50,160
secure and this is a pretty desirable

245
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,569
property to have it's not it's not the

246
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,850
be-all end-all and we'll see an

247
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:55,830
extension of it later but it's a good

248
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:59,130
starting point and you can already see

249
00:09:55,830 --> 00:10:01,260
how cryptographers think about security

250
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:03,870
right it's all about these games these

251
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:06,360
chances with these probabilities we

252
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:10,380
model an interaction and we think about

253
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:13,290
how likely is it that we can break it so

254
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:15,750
let's do an example we're gonna pick a

255
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:17,490
simple crypto system this may be one

256
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:19,200
that some of the audience may be

257
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:21,660
familiar with we're gonna pick a number

258
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,720
between 0 and 25 and that's gonna be a

259
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:26,910
secret key to encrypt a message we'll

260
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,830
rotate the letters right words by that

261
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:30,689
much and if we go off the end we'll just

262
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:33,630
go back around so if you know if our

263
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:37,050
secret key is 2y and suffered a's and

264
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:39,750
ends up at b and so on otherwise here's

265
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:41,910
an example we take hello we encrypt it

266
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:44,760
and we get this little random looking

267
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:46,560
string you may already be thinking well

268
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:49,980
it's not really random looking right if

269
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:53,640
this double L got maps to this double n

270
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:55,320
here we'll come back to that but for the

271
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,270
time being let's think of an even

272
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,779
simpler reason that this crypto system

273
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:01,670
is broken

274
00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:03,870
what's the probability that you can

275
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:05,790
decrypt a message what's the probability

276
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:07,680
you can get the message without knowing

277
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,510
the secret key well

278
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,810
ideally you have to guess randomly

279
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:16,350
between 0 and 25 but the problem with

280
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:18,719
that is a 1 in 25 shot is not that small

281
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:22,080
so this system is already broken but

282
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:25,290
well user to illustrate how to reason

283
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:27,570
about such systems so if we play the

284
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:31,020
game our Challenger is generating a

285
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:32,940
secret key in this case to the adversary

286
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:35,100
is going to send two messages to the

287
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:38,279
Challenger in this case the adversary

288
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:40,860
chooses a B and a C now the challengers

289
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:43,529
gotta toss a coin they got heads so C

290
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:46,410
Challenger is gonna send the encryption

291
00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:48,660
of a B which in this case is C D to a

292
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:52,890
alright we've got an encrypted message a

293
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:56,219
B which looks like C D now a goes huh C

294
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:58,290
D the letters are one apart if they get

295
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,920
encrypted AC the letters would be two

296
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:01,380
apart

297
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:03,209
say say a the adversary nor is the

298
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:05,189
Challenger must have chosen the first

299
00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:05,640
message so the adversary can just say

300
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:09,450
all right

301
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:11,189
first message and they always win so

302
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:13,970
this system which we call the Caesar

303
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:16,800
cipher because it was at least Apocrypha

304
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:18,690
apocryphally I'm sure some ancient Roman

305
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,670
historian is out there cursing my name

306
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:22,410
we call it the Caesar cipher because

307
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:25,260
Julius Caesar used it in ancient Rome

308
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:30,270
and it's not indistinguishable secure it

309
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:32,730
fails this desirable property and it's

310
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:35,100
useful to think about why and the reason

311
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:37,800
we broke this is the relationship

312
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:39,839
between the messages a B and a C the

313
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,910
distance between the two letters that

314
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,620
relationship was not broken

315
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:46,380
okay it was preserved when we encrypted

316
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:48,240
it the relationship stuck around and the

317
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:51,600
adversary could use that to break the

318
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:54,209
system now we call this a oh there's a

319
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,920
typo here that's that's embarrassing we

320
00:12:54,209 --> 00:12:58,319
call this a choice and plaintext attack

321
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,270
hence the header right and the idea is

322
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,990
the adversary choice what plaintext to

323
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:07,140
use and because they knew it they could

324
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:10,110
break the system now a real world system

325
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:13,740
like a s for example in the Galois

326
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:15,900
counter mode mode or like RSA when it's

327
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,970
used in practice where the important

328
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:20,010
part is when it's used in practice real

329
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:21,150
world systems are not vulnerable to

330
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:24,680
choice and plaintiff

331
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:27,959
to tax and it's not too hard to see why

332
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:30,180
if you're looking at HTTP connection a

333
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:32,760
secure connection encrypted with a nice

334
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:34,020
symmetric key the first message a lot of

335
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:38,280
the time is going to start something

336
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:39,990
like gets slash HTTP slash 1.1 so you

337
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:42,890
already know a little bit of a message

338
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:45,630
that's being sent if your system is not

339
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:47,819
if your system is vulnerable to a chosen

340
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:50,220
plaintext attack that's not a very

341
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:52,080
practically useful algorithm because a

342
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,760
lot of the time either you know the

343
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:57,000
whole plaintext or you know at least a

344
00:13:53,760 --> 00:14:02,100
little bit of it so we ask a little bit

345
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:06,390
more of our systems yeah if you use them

346
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:07,740
properly okay so unfortunately as I'm

347
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:09,270
sure if you've ever experienced

348
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:12,300
experimented in the space you might know

349
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:15,449
it's very easy to mess up some of the

350
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:19,109
assumptions made so for example AES asks

351
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:21,360
you in the CBC mode AES asks you give me

352
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:23,400
a random set of values to initialize

353
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,500
with if you forget to give it a random

354
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:28,380
set of values it will be hopelessly

355
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:30,210
broken so they don't they're not

356
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:32,100
vulnerable to these attacks but you need

357
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:35,070
to make sure that you follow the

358
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,300
assumptions made by the systems alright

359
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:40,110
we'll come back to that at the end of

360
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:44,849
the talk so x3 as promised we're

361
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:46,530
returning to public keys so if you're

362
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:49,710
not familiar with the idea of a public

363
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:53,040
key the first widespread use of it was

364
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:55,950
in the 70s when Rivest Shamir rivet

365
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:58,260
Rivest Shamir and Adleman I always miss

366
00:14:55,950 --> 00:15:01,020
their name so invented the RSA algorithm

367
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:03,150
and this is the classic algorithm use

368
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:05,160
for public key cryptography it's still

369
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:06,959
used alone at the time today

370
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:09,959
there are differing opinions and whether

371
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:12,000
that's a good thing but it is a vitally

372
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:14,550
important historical algorithm now the

373
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,520
idea is Alice and Bob can talk to each

374
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:19,349
other without having agreed on a secret

375
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:21,390
key and that works

376
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:24,120
they have boated they have public keys

377
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:26,610
so Alice has a key a and she tells

378
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:29,640
everyone the key everyone knows this

379
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:32,790
public key a and similarly Bob has his

380
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:34,439
public key B which everyone knows but

381
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:37,139
only Alice knows the

382
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:39,810
funding secret key or private key that

383
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:42,480
can decrypt those messages so anyone can

384
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:44,819
send a message tell us anyone can send a

385
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,279
message to Bob but only Alice can

386
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:49,889
decrypt her messages and only Bob can

387
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:52,319
decrypt his messages so for example

388
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:55,079
Alice may send the message how are you

389
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:57,628
encrypted with Bob's key Bob can decrypt

390
00:15:55,079 --> 00:16:00,359
that read it and send the response good

391
00:15:57,629 --> 00:16:02,220
thanks you encrypted with Alice's key

392
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,800
now this is a different cryptographic

393
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:06,839
model it has its its advantages and

394
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,660
disadvantages over symmetric

395
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:11,730
cryptography notably that this is

396
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:14,069
usually a lot more computationally

397
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:16,529
intensive but they both have their uses

398
00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:19,410
now I'm gonna focus on public key

399
00:16:16,529 --> 00:16:21,899
cryptography because I think it's more

400
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:24,420
interesting I'm biased here I think it's

401
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:26,490
more interesting symmetric encryption is

402
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:30,209
super interesting too but there's a lot

403
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:32,759
less theoretical depth behind it so

404
00:16:30,209 --> 00:16:35,609
here's a better game remember last time

405
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:39,360
that the adversary won because it knew

406
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:40,759
something about the plain text and I'm

407
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,769
gonna argue this is a better game

408
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:45,870
because we're gonna encode that into the

409
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:48,630
system we're gonna make the assumption

410
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:49,259
the adversary can always encrypt a

411
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:51,300
message

412
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:53,370
they are always able to take whatever

413
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:56,609
message they want and discover what its

414
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:58,709
encryption is and if we're if our system

415
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:01,230
is secure with this stronger assumption

416
00:16:58,709 --> 00:17:03,089
well it's a stronger system so it's

417
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:05,039
exactly the same you might notice is the

418
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:07,740
indistinguishability game with one

419
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:09,449
little addition the Challenger runs the

420
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:12,209
generation algorithm they get a public

421
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:14,100
key and it's secret key the Challenger

422
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:15,990
gives the adversary the public key and

423
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:17,969
also it gives it access to the

424
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:20,400
encryption algorithm so we're not even

425
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:22,409
assuming how it works as a secret we're

426
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,030
telling the adversary hey here's the

427
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:24,390
algorithm if you want to encrypt a

428
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:27,000
message

429
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:29,520
knock yourself out now the adversary

430
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,440
with this information is going to send

431
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,090
two messages whatever it likes to the

432
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,409
Challenger challenge is going to

433
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:36,629
encourage one of them according to a

434
00:17:34,409 --> 00:17:39,080
coin flip and the adversary is going to

435
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:41,820
try to guess which one got encrypted and

436
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:45,600
again we say exactly the same thing if

437
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:46,700
they have if they have only a tiny bit

438
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,219
better than a 50

439
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:51,350
a shot at winning it's in CPA

440
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:52,700
indistinguishable chosen plaintext

441
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:56,300
attack huh

442
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:58,610
secure all right so it's a stronger

443
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:01,389
guarantee if we if we can prove our

444
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:03,740
system is secure by this these terms

445
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:06,170
then we've got a stronger system and

446
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:09,020
this is something I want you to think

447
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:11,060
about if you're not a cryptographer we

448
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:13,160
have different guarantees different

449
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:17,149
types of security some of them are

450
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:19,070
stronger than others so you know there

451
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:21,380
is no one definition of security it

452
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:24,919
depends a lot on your model just like

453
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:28,190
anything else in cyber security all

454
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:31,760
right so we're gonna end by seeing how

455
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:35,300
to prove a system satisfies this chosen

456
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,580
plaintext attack security but first

457
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:39,379
we're gonna have a little bit of maths

458
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:41,449
if maths isn't your forte I apologize

459
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:45,920
you don't need it to follow the essence

460
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:47,780
but if you're curious and read on so

461
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:50,150
modular arithmetic it works like Locke

462
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:52,490
you've got a clock it points at five

463
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:54,920
o'clock you add eight hours you end up

464
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:58,850
at one o'clock and the way that works is

465
00:18:54,920 --> 00:19:01,460
we do our addition and then take the

466
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:04,280
remainder modulo 12 all right

467
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:05,660
so this mod thingy here if you use to

468
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:08,510
programming a lot of programming

469
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:11,690
languages use the percent here the

470
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:13,910
modular operation says divide by 12 and

471
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:16,220
take the remainder so divide 13 by 12 if

472
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:18,380
you get one I saw you get zero with one

473
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:20,480
remainder that remainder is 1 so our

474
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:23,510
result is one o'clock we call this

475
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:27,200
addition modulo 12 it's just fancy name

476
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:30,050
and it turns out that raising things to

477
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,300
powers is one way if you do it right so

478
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:34,790
if you make the right choices raising

479
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:37,639
powers is one way you know gee you know

480
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:39,830
q and you know that Y is equal to G to

481
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:43,120
the power of it oh that should be P

482
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:46,610
Y is equal to G to the power of X mod P

483
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:50,239
that should be hard to guess X so you

484
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:52,699
know all of the ingredients you know you

485
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,070
know this this base number G you know

486
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:57,620
the final result Y you know what we're

487
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:59,450
taking the modulo of but you don't know

488
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:02,029
X it's hard to

489
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:05,210
we call this the discrete log problem

490
00:20:02,029 --> 00:20:08,210
and it's the basis of a lot of modern

491
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:09,500
systems it's not too hard to grasp so

492
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:14,179
it's a nice one that I thought I would

493
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:15,649
choose so with the right numbers is a

494
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:18,139
little explanation of what I mean by

495
00:20:15,649 --> 00:20:21,699
that down here there is a lot of

496
00:20:18,139 --> 00:20:21,699
complicated reasons why that is the case

497
00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:28,070
so hard to guess again that's that's a

498
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:30,049
pretty loose term and we want to define

499
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:31,668
what that means formally we want to have

500
00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:32,570
a convincing argument for what that's

501
00:20:31,669 --> 00:20:34,549
supposed to mean

502
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:36,889
so we call this the decisional

503
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:39,230
diffie-hellman game and the reason for

504
00:20:36,889 --> 00:20:42,168
that is because as a system DV Hellman

505
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:44,299
or th which is used to agree on keys and

506
00:20:42,169 --> 00:20:45,950
it relies on this assumption so recall

507
00:20:44,299 --> 00:20:49,158
it the decisional diffie-hellman problem

508
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:52,820
and the idea is Challenger chooses three

509
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:54,470
powers a B and C tells the adversary G

510
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:58,129
to the power of a and G to the power of

511
00:20:54,470 --> 00:21:01,730
B and then either G to the power of a B

512
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:03,529
or G the power of C is sent to a the

513
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:06,649
adversary a-- and then the adversary has

514
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:09,320
to guess which one was sent so the idea

515
00:21:06,649 --> 00:21:11,719
is if you if you could guess X if you

516
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:15,049
could undo this exponentiation then it's

517
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:17,659
easy right just undo the exponent if

518
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:20,840
it's a be sweet if it's not then well

519
00:21:17,659 --> 00:21:23,299
you know which is which so given that

520
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:26,000
exponentiation is hard it should be hard

521
00:21:23,299 --> 00:21:28,070
to do this so if it's hard to do this we

522
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,830
say all right this is a strong basis for

523
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:33,200
our security and some of you might be

524
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:36,769
thinking well why do we have to assume

525
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:39,529
that this is this is hard how do we

526
00:21:36,769 --> 00:21:41,019
prove that the answer is I don't know

527
00:21:39,529 --> 00:21:43,610
and neither does anyone else

528
00:21:41,019 --> 00:21:45,230
it's quite difficult to figure out

529
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,678
whether problems are hard in computer

530
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:47,690
science

531
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:51,830
quite a fundamental problem that we keep

532
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:53,570
running into so a lot of the time we

533
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:55,668
just assume something like this is hard

534
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:58,070
and if someone manages to break it well

535
00:21:55,669 --> 00:21:59,600
you know there's quite a big incentive

536
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:00,889
to break it so summer manages to break

537
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,350
it then we'll move on to something else

538
00:22:00,889 --> 00:22:05,809
but for now this seems pretty sacrosanct

539
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:10,189
if you make the right number choices it

540
00:22:05,809 --> 00:22:12,290
is very hard to undo exponentiation now

541
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:14,240
we can turn this into a cryptosystem

542
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:16,159
go a one-way function something that's

543
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,320
hard to undo if you don't know the

544
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:20,450
secret so gonna pick a random number X

545
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,310
that's gonna be our secret key another

546
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:24,500
random number well take G or the power

547
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:26,780
of X we end up with Y which is the

548
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,880
public key and remember it's really hard

549
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:31,639
to undo this right

550
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,620
if you don't know X it's really hard to

551
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,360
guess what it might be so we can tell

552
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:37,669
everyone what weighs and it'll just look

553
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,290
like a random number to them if we're

554
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:41,840
gonna encrypt a message and add some

555
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:43,960
details pick a random number I'll put

556
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,970
this thingy which is a pair of numbers

557
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:49,430
we're gonna decrypt it well because we

558
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:51,110
know X we can take the first thing raise

559
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:52,640
it to the power of X and then we can

560
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:56,000
just divide through and we end up with a

561
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:58,100
message so crucially we had to know X if

562
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,470
we didn't know X we couldn't raise this

563
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:03,169
the right power to make it cancel out

564
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:06,170
the Y all right so this is the el-gamal

565
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:07,730
cryptosystem it's one that I'm quite

566
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:11,090
familiar with and quite fond of I'm

567
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:14,060
using it a lot in my research so here's

568
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:17,330
the grand finale we're going to show if

569
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:19,429
you break out Gumbel's security then you

570
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:21,379
can break decisional diffie-hellman and

571
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:23,000
that might sound a little bit strange

572
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:24,280
isn't isn't decisional diffie-hellman

573
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,100
meant to be hard

574
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:30,080
exactly the point is if you could break

575
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:32,000
El Gamal then you can break decisional

576
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,470
diffie-hellman but you can't break

577
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,930
decisional diffie-hellman so you can't

578
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:39,440
break out Gamal so proof by

579
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:42,110
contradiction so we're going to try to

580
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,940
break decisional diffie-hellman knowing

581
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:46,280
that we can already magically break El

582
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:49,070
Gamal we have been given G to the power

583
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:51,440
of Ag the power of B and we're given one

584
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:53,540
of these two things is a change with a B

585
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:57,470
or G to the C but we don't know which

586
00:23:53,540 --> 00:24:00,710
one our job is to work out which one was

587
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:02,750
sent to us so we're gonna we're gonna

588
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:04,640
grab Alice hello you're part of this now

589
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:07,730
we're gonna play the indistinguishable

590
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,860
cpa game with ellis but instead of

591
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:13,220
letting her encrypt things were secretly

592
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:16,909
gonna give her this fiddled function

593
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:19,940
right I should have put what are M times

594
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:21,650
y is the power of B here right

595
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:24,080
should have given her that but I'm gonna

596
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:25,370
give her X which is either G to the

597
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,710
power of a B or

598
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:32,059
see and she's gonna be none the wiser

599
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:35,720
and notice this in this case if I

600
00:24:32,059 --> 00:24:38,840
secretly was a then well G ^ a B is the

601
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:41,840
same thing as public key ^ B which is

602
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:44,720
what it should be so if we were really

603
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:47,600
were given G ^ a B this really is

604
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:50,000
encryption but if we're given G ^ C

605
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,669
that's some random number so this isn't

606
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,080
encryption Alice doesn't marry but it's

607
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:57,850
just complete garbage

608
00:24:54,080 --> 00:25:00,710
so if Alice wins the game if Alice can

609
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:02,750
decrypt this message recover decrypt the

610
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:04,490
ciphertext recover the message we're

611
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:07,580
gonna guess that we got cheated the

612
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:10,160
power of C I got that backwards we're

613
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:12,439
gonna just guess that she got we got G

614
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:16,990
the power of AV otherwise Anna guessed

615
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:19,730
gene for power maybe I don't see so

616
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:21,530
remember we're gonna be given Alice this

617
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:24,440
fake encryption function and she's gonna

618
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:26,330
try to break it if x equals power

619
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:28,970
achieved of the power of see Alice

620
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:31,010
doesn't see a real encryption so she has

621
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:33,110
no hope of winning best she can do is

622
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:36,050
guess randomly so we're also just gonna

623
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:36,709
guess randomly but if X is GU the power

624
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:39,350
of a B

625
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:41,870
Alice sees a real encryption of her

626
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:43,969
message that means she wins more often

627
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:47,300
than not write a little bit more than a

628
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:49,460
half and we said that Alice could break

629
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:52,760
algum well we assumed that we could

630
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:54,950
break out Gamal but decisional

631
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:57,080
diffie-hellman is hard so there's no way

632
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:58,790
that Alice can win more than a tiny

633
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:03,260
percentage of the time of other half

634
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:05,300
right the fundamental idea is if Alice

635
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:07,190
could break the system then we could

636
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:10,220
break decisional diffie-hellman but we

637
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:13,520
can't so she can't and that means that

638
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:17,000
the el-gamal system is into CPA secure

639
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:19,340
if we assume this deep this difficult

640
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,350
assumption which is it's pretty high so

641
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:24,980
quite a lot of empirical data to back it

642
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:26,840
up by this point so the conclusions that

643
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:28,190
I want you to take away especially if

644
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:31,909
you're not a cryptographer if you're not

645
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:34,429
a math C type cryptography in most of

646
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:36,800
the time in practice is probabilistic so

647
00:26:34,429 --> 00:26:38,500
we're not saying you can't break it but

648
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,480
we're saying you can't break it in

649
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:43,290
reasonable amount of time unless you're

650
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:45,520
really really lucky now another thing is

651
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:47,710
we're really sensitive to the

652
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,520
assumptions that we make I already said

653
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:51,100
that

654
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:53,889
a s in CBC mode you have to give it a

655
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:55,659
random bunch of data to start with if

656
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:58,930
it's not random then you're busted

657
00:26:55,660 --> 00:27:01,390
similarly if you can solve DDH if you

658
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:03,580
choose the numbers wrong such that you

659
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:05,680
can guess the difference between the two

660
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:08,080
things our gamma was completely broken

661
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:12,700
right we only proved it was secure if

662
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:14,290
you assume this property and also you

663
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:16,180
need to reread the specification

664
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:18,879
carefully it's gonna tell you exactly

665
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:21,070
what is and isn't allowed you're gonna

666
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,300
be like you're gonna be told okay well

667
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:23,919
you have to pick a particular prime

668
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:26,169
number with this certain property and

669
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:28,750
make sure that if you're GU don't pick a

670
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:30,820
dumb number and so on and so forth right

671
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:32,920
so make sure you read the spec really

672
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:35,379
carefully and don't try to implement it

673
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:37,300
yourself this is why we say there are so

674
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:39,820
many hiddenness of not hidden but there

675
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:41,889
are so many difficult assumptions and

676
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:44,409
fiddly details don't try to do it

677
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:46,150
yourself if you can avoid it and perhaps

678
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:48,760
the most important thing crypto is

679
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:50,470
really interesting the details of how

680
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:52,210
all these things work and how we

681
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:54,820
convince ourselves that they actually

682
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:55,360
work is super fascinating and it's worth

683
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,889
a read

684
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:00,040
even if this isn't your main area

685
00:27:56,890 --> 00:28:04,000
because we rely on it screw much TLS

686
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:05,649
HTTP DNS security so many things rely on

687
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,690
cryptography and if you're interested

688
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:11,020
here are some cool references that I can

689
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:12,400
highly recommend and that is all I hope

690
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:15,840
you learned something I'm going to turn

691
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,840
off the slides in a sec

692
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:37,410
well thank you very much

693
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:40,389
ellen:oh for that out just like through

694
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:42,940
we do have a couple of questions we have

695
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:45,780
one from the slack and just a reminder

696
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:48,190
for everyone we do have a slack channel

697
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:50,230
Patsey science on the baselines campus

698
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:52,210
like there are the webpage for c slides

699
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:53,770
these ones chemical that i you and

700
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:55,390
you'll be able to get the details along

701
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:57,910
into that slide but the question on the

702
00:28:55,390 --> 00:29:00,340
slack was what are your thoughts on

703
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:02,620
first quantum cryptography and what are

704
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:04,780
your thoughts and experiences is it

705
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:08,409
gonna change the bold are we gonna do we

706
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:10,660
are we safe are we safe in these yeah

707
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:13,510
we're here it's our that's obviously a

708
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:15,610
really hot topic at the moment both

709
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:17,410
inside krypter and outside crypto

710
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:19,780
everyone's everyone's interested a

711
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:22,630
quantum computers gonna steal my credit

712
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:26,980
card the answer is maybe they're

713
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:29,140
probably not yes so the the reason if

714
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:30,820
you're not familiar quantum computers

715
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:32,860
use a different approach to your

716
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:34,809
computing or we think it's different at

717
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:37,209
least no one knows for sure yet there's

718
00:29:34,809 --> 00:29:38,740
a different approach and that means that

719
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:41,650
there is actually an efficient algorithm

720
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:43,780
that can break RSA and there is an

721
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:46,900
efficient algorithm a variant of it can

722
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:49,600
also break out Gamal for example so the

723
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:52,590
question is asking you know Kate can we

724
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:57,010
use this to a role our secret student

725
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:59,949
yes well not yet and the reason is you

726
00:29:57,010 --> 00:30:02,440
need a really big really stable quantum

727
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:06,250
computer to affect effectively run these

728
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:09,760
algorithms last I read they were able to

729
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:12,610
factor I think eight to ten bit Keys was

730
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:16,090
the best anyone's done and modern RSA

731
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:18,189
uses 2048 bit keys they've got a while

732
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:20,290
to go yet and classical computers

733
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:23,799
actually much better at breaking RSA the

734
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:25,240
quantum computers at the moments bus if

735
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:26,830
we have a sudden breakthrough in

736
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:29,380
large-scale quantum computers become a

737
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:31,210
reality then we need to shift we need to

738
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:33,730
shift our thinking come up with other

739
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:35,169
ideas and the good news is a lot of

740
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:38,290
really clever people people much smarter

741
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:39,520
than myself run Steinfeld on what ash is

742
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:42,159
one of them

743
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,360
they've done a lot of work on systems

744
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:45,130
that are safe even

745
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,629
with a quantum computer if you

746
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:53,110
interested the keyword is lettuce

747
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:54,520
cryptography lettuce Li la TT IC e foods

748
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:56,560
like a follow-on to that question just

749
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:58,540
sort of this is why maybe it's quite a

750
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:01,570
broad question I suppose I think EC

751
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:04,450
cryptographic research now as sort of

752
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:06,550
you know not much research is happening

753
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:07,990
or is it like a period of lots of

754
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:09,760
research and I mean he talked about

755
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:11,500
asymmetric crypto in the 70s being

756
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,540
introduced as you know we Buccaneer

757
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:15,850
block ciphers upstream slightly very

758
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:17,740
symmetric crypto is it all over well

759
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:23,469
we've got a new world of crypto that's

760
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:26,350
waiting to be invented and a vitally

761
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:30,340
important question um so the way I see

762
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:32,760
it is symmetric crypto is mostly a

763
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:36,280
solved problem from my perspective

764
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:39,670
symmetric AES works fine no one's found

765
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:41,320
really good at attack against it not

766
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:43,810
very interesting similarly

767
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:46,629
diffie-hellman works really well unless

768
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:48,700
you have a corner computer RSA that

769
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:50,620
works fine we have better algorithms

770
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:52,330
using elliptic curves nowadays but you

771
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:55,510
know all of that stuff the fundamentals

772
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:57,429
fine sold problem um where it gets

773
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:59,710
really interesting is applying these

774
00:31:57,430 --> 00:32:01,360
ideas so in the last decade or so

775
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:04,180
there's been a huge amount of research

776
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:07,689
on what I call zero knowledge proof and

777
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:09,280
the idea is I know some secret value I'm

778
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:11,050
gonna prove to you that I know the

779
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,790
secret like it I'm gonna prove that I

780
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:14,290
know the secret key but I'm not gonna

781
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:16,990
I'm not going to tell you anything about

782
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:18,550
the secret key so that's one really

783
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:21,550
active field of research at the moment

784
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:25,240
how do I prove more and more complex

785
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:27,520
things it's relevant to I I fear to say

786
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:30,760
the word but it's relevant to blockchain

787
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:33,250
research as well because well how do you

788
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:34,960
verify a Bitcoin blockchain you start

789
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:36,430
from the beginning check the first hash

790
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,590
check the second hash check the third

791
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:41,770
hash it takes forever and the blockchain

792
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:45,580
is huge I think it was like multiple

793
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:47,740
terabytes when I last heard so a lot of

794
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:49,360
research is focusing how can we prove

795
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:51,670
facts how can we prove things a

796
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:54,250
legitimate in more efficient and more

797
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:56,250
flexible ways so that's one thing the

798
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:58,440
other thing post quantum crypto

799
00:32:56,250 --> 00:33:00,510
as a huge flurry of people working on

800
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:03,809
what are some what are some future

801
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:05,940
future proof one of mechanisms sorry

802
00:33:03,809 --> 00:33:07,230
future proof crypto mechanisms that

803
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:09,750
might replace the ones we've got

804
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:11,669
so I'd say it's a very active field but

805
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:16,950
we've moved away from a lot of the more

806
00:33:11,669 --> 00:33:21,260
foundational stuff there was an extra

807
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:24,539
question on the slack from maybe here

808
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:28,730
asking if Eleanor has any favorite PQ

809
00:33:24,539 --> 00:33:28,730
systems that are cool and all should win

810
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:39,360
so I hopefully have I am woefully under

811
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:43,610
ed in the area but a lot of systems are

812
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:46,350
really exciting the idea behind it is

813
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:50,879
you have a linear algebra problem so

814
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:53,789
you've got a matrix and you've got a

815
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,590
matrix equation and the idea is you've

816
00:33:53,789 --> 00:33:56,190
got to find a solution to the matrix

817
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:58,289
equation

818
00:33:56,190 --> 00:34:01,140
but not just any solution it has to be a

819
00:33:58,289 --> 00:34:03,750
solution and remember it's my solving

820
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:05,159
for a vector so a list of numbers has to

821
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:07,500
be a solution with a really small

822
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:09,750
magnitude so if you add all the numbers

823
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:12,859
up it has to be has to stay quite small

824
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:15,210
and that's interesting to me because

825
00:34:12,859 --> 00:34:17,279
without Gamal it's like well if you

826
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:19,918
guess the secret key the game's up with

827
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,080
a with a letter system it's not you

828
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:24,449
can't just guess one possible answer you

829
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:26,069
have to guess an efficient answer and I

830
00:34:24,449 --> 00:34:28,439
think that's really exciting that there

831
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:29,970
are lots of possible secret keys in from

832
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:32,280
one perspective I think that's really

833
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:35,129
interesting and shows a lot of promise

834
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:39,629
but um I wanna be stupid on the area so

835
00:34:35,129 --> 00:34:41,779
don't quote me that was great that was

836
00:34:39,629 --> 00:34:41,779
great

837
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:48,810
and I think there are any white legs on

838
00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:51,450
a slow-mo black but I think a lot of

839
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:53,668
people clapping and cheering and talking

840
00:34:51,449 --> 00:34:56,759
about your talks they probably had good

841
00:34:53,668 --> 00:35:00,440
there if you can and could keep clapping

842
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,440
so thanks for yeah
