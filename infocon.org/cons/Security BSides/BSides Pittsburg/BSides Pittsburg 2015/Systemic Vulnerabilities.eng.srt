1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,410
everybody so this may actually be one of

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,000
the nerdiest days of geekiest days in my

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,039
entire life I'm here presenting at

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:09,630
besides Pittsburgh my daughter is

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,580
finishing up the girls of steel robotics

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,009
camp over CMU and tonight is the Martian

7
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:15,809
new year celebration in Mars PA with

8
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:17,699
people from NASA coming out to talk so

9
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:20,220
it's like it's a whole day of weird

10
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,090
stuff all right so this is not your

11
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,779
typical technical talk in fact it's not

12
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:28,859
technical at all it's almost all

13
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:33,510
pictures and like John oh I apparently

14
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,110
have a really cute taste for very long

15
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,969
words in title so systemic

16
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:40,920
vulnerabilities and allegorical tale of

17
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,270
steampunk vulnerability to error

18
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,030
physical threats and that's not a

19
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,969
mouthful at all jano said there would be

20
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:50,010
a quiz this is the quiz now if you

21
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,480
haven't memorized this yet there's this

22
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,399
is your last chance so I actually wanna

23
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,600
talk about a story that goes all the way

24
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:07,560
back to the late 19th century and follow

25
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,479
that through to today so I need to cover

26
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:12,119
about 137 years in the next 25 minutes

27
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:15,330
so it's going to be quick um but we

28
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,790
started in Paris in around 1878 with

29
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,750
this guy Jules Verne and Jules Verne as

30
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,340
you may know was one of the earliest

31
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,470
science fiction authors and in the 80s

32
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,619
he was thinking about heavier than air

33
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:37,890
vs lighter than air aircrafts I he wrote

34
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,630
a book called rubber like rubber the

35
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:44,220
Conqueror that included the whole story

36
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,149
was a was about included that this

37
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:51,540
flying airship thing that was part of

38
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,829
the debate between whether or not

39
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:54,240
heavier-than-air craft or

40
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,670
lighter-than-air craft would would

41
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,790
eventually essentially win the day and

42
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:00,990
keep him on this this is about 10 years

43
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,490
after he wrote around the world in 80

44
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,590
days so he'd already done the balloon

45
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,320
thing and now he wanted to do flying

46
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,380
helicopter ship

47
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:12,160
which is really cool I think the

48
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,690
Avengers stole the whole aircraft

49
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:18,480
carrier hover carrier thing from this so

50
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,060
this is the 18 1880s and Jules Verne

51
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,890
rights writes a book talking about

52
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,450
heavier-than-air craft and keep in mind

53
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:27,820
like at this point this is pure science

54
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,410
fiction no one has ever gotten anything

55
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,660
heavier than air off the ground there's

56
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:35,890
no powered flight yet so let's jump

57
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:39,880
ahead a couple of years to and come back

58
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,920
across the ocean from from Paris to

59
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,810
Chicago this is around eighteen ninety I

60
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:49,170
and Chicago had some traffic problems

61
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:54,040
there was some a lot of most most cities

62
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,970
had just kind of gotten to the point

63
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,650
where the population was growing in

64
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,760
cities people are moving in from the

65
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,920
farms the Industrial Revolution has been

66
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,960
going on for a while and you've got a

67
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,420
lot of a lot of traffic that requires

68
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,520
people to start planning for things so

69
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,140
you have architect like daniel burnham

70
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:12,640
who is known for designing buildings but

71
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,750
he really started getting into city

72
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,660
planning it and around this time he had

73
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,330
a couple early successes and he

74
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:22,300
gradually are you eventually 1893 was

75
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,230
named the the i think the lead architect

76
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,240
or something along those lines for the

77
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,940
Chicago World's Fair I'm coincidentally

78
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,830
the Eiffel Tower was built for the the

79
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,150
Paris World's Fair that happened a few

80
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,010
years earlier so we hopped someone

81
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,810
rolled straight up to the next dan

82
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,150
Burnham is the architect here and he

83
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,310
rises to significant Fame I mean there's

84
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:45,000
he's got a lot of other jobs after that

85
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,470
um meanwhile this guy Andrew Carnegie

86
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:52,180
decides that he's he's got about enough

87
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,880
money and he wants to start on a

88
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,100
building universities or museums or

89
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:01,870
things and so he wants that he wants to

90
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:04,360
sell off the cranky Steel Corporation

91
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,340
and the Keystone bridge corporation and

92
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,890
he finds a willing buyer in JP Morgan

93
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,420
who conveniently turns these things into

94
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,360
the

95
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,120
into United States Steel and the

96
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,298
American Bridge Company had qward down

97
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:21,140
the river a ways in fact the american

98
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,340
bridge company is so important to the

99
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,570
town that it's in that they rename the

100
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:28,790
town in 1905 to ambridge PA so the

101
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,950
american bridge company gets a contract

102
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,230
to build a building designed by Daniel

103
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:39,410
Burnham in 1901 this this is the the

104
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,000
flat iron belt or but would come to be

105
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,430
known as a flatiron building in New York

106
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:46,730
it's not the first steel steel with

107
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,530
concrete skin structure but it's one of

108
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:51,890
the earlier ones 22 stories high and has

109
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,480
this really unique shape in that it has

110
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,340
to fit onto a little triangular lot you

111
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,049
may have seen this this building before

112
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:02,060
eventually it's finished in 1902 and it

113
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,640
opens up and if you notice the

114
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,840
transportation down at the bottom

115
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,750
there's there's some streetcars and

116
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,050
there's our trolleys and horse carts and

117
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,870
people on foot now here's where I'm

118
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,540
going to drop 40,000 day vulnerability

119
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,880
on you so I'm going to assert that this

120
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,890
this building is vulnerable to 300

121
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:24,890
15,000 pounds of aluminum with 16,000

122
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,330
gallons of kerosene in it flying it

123
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:30,140
moving at 500 miles an hour that's a

124
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:33,620
serious vulnerability because if you do

125
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,680
the CBS s score for it on you need to be

126
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,290
you need to be adjacent to it and it's

127
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,820
very high complexity because this is

128
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,250
1902 and there's no powered flight we're

129
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,780
talking about you know Jules Verne wrote

130
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:47,600
about powered heavier-than-air craft so

131
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,700
at this point like there's no such thing

132
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,950
as 300 15,000 pounds of aluminum flying

133
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,150
through the air at 500 miles an hour

134
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:55,430
that just you know no one no one's done

135
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:59,870
that so the access complexity is fairly

136
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,700
high on but you don't need to be

137
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,010
authenticated and you know there's

138
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:06,080
confidentiality impact that's partial

139
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,430
because presumably if the building blows

140
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,690
up all the papers kind of blow out

141
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:11,000
around the town but you're pretty sure

142
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,229
you're going to have complete integrity

143
00:06:12,229 --> 00:06:13,880
and complete availability impact because

144
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,950
you know you drop something that big on

145
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,300
it it's going to it's going to damage

146
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,900
the building at the least

147
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,110
but we're at cert and we don't just do

148
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:25,389
the the base CBS s core we do the

149
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:27,430
temporal score too so we actually want

150
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:30,850
to keep track of you know it's unproven

151
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:33,759
that an exploit exists there's really no

152
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,190
remediation to it and we haven't

153
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,320
confirmed the report because frankly

154
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,620
this is just me making it up based on

155
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,600
what I based on whatever read in some

156
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,130
Jules Verne book we expect that the

157
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,389
building is going to have going to

158
00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:50,650
maintain integrity and maintain

159
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:54,010
availability we also recognize that the

160
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,449
collateral damage potential you know if

161
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:56,440
that were to happen there's going to be

162
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,699
a mess in the town not just at that

163
00:06:57,699 --> 00:06:59,020
building so there's a lot of collateral

164
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,780
damage potential so the end score is a

165
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:05,289
base for 6.5 and an overall CBS s core

166
00:07:05,289 --> 00:07:09,250
7.6 when I presented this to some folks

167
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,260
from vendors guy from Microsoft raises

168
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,360
his hand and says doesn't this tell you

169
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,370
what's what's broken about CBS s because

170
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,810
you've got it you've got an imaginary

171
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:19,660
science fiction threat that gets 6.5

172
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,759
score which is probably high enough for

173
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,630
most people to react to yeah I agree

174
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:28,780
it's a little weird but I also pointed

175
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,520
out that I'm you know I'm totally

176
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,710
misapplying what CBS s is meant for for

177
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:36,490
this time so anyway that's 1902 based on

178
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:39,490
what we know and then 1903 these guys

179
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,289
managed to get their heavier-than-air

180
00:07:41,289 --> 00:07:42,729
craft off the ground down in North

181
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:49,270
Carolina well so reality catches up with

182
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:52,690
science fiction over time and Vern goes

183
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:54,729
back to to his pen and he started he

184
00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:56,380
starts writing a sequel to Rover the

185
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,570
Conqueror in which the Albatross that

186
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:01,690
heavy flying helicopter boat thing comes

187
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:05,349
back but this time there's also this

188
00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:07,330
device called the terror which is a

189
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,130
flying boat car that goes at the

190
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:11,440
blinding speed of 150 miles an hour and

191
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,150
at this point as far as I know the only

192
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:15,130
people who have gone 150 miles an hour

193
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,510
we're falling off a cliff on the way to

194
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:19,599
their death because that you couldn't

195
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,000
get going that fast at that point not to

196
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,940
be outdone the other great sci-fi author

197
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:30,729
of the time hg wells happens to come

198
00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:32,450
over to New York to do a

199
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:35,000
to do a or he actually does a tour of

200
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,299
the country of the u.s. he was British

201
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:39,470
you consider it does it toward the US

202
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,450
and writes an article for The Atlantic

203
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,270
Monthly and in that article he mentions

204
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:47,690
you know how inspiring the the the

205
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:51,590
Flatiron Building is in in his art as

206
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:52,970
far as his appreciation of American

207
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:57,380
architecture he goes back to goes back

208
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:00,260
home and based on what he what has

209
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,790
happened in the last couple years you

210
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,230
know with the Wright brothers and all

211
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,700
this stuff he goes back and writes a

212
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:08,210
book called the war in the air which in

213
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:12,170
1908 had some pretty sci-fi concepts in

214
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:14,330
it since been claimed that like this

215
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,250
priests aged most of the air war of

216
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:19,550
world war one but the illustrations have

217
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,830
these really cool like dirigibles just

218
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:25,580
all over the place so meanwhile flat

219
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:28,340
iron building is still standing and this

220
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,740
time around the the transportation has

221
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,700
changed a little bit there's some

222
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,290
there's some motor cards there as well

223
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:35,060
as a few horse-drawn carts and some

224
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,920
trolleys and stuff but this doesn't

225
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,350
really reflect the reality of the day so

226
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,000
they took this picture back to the

227
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,830
photoshop and added that little biplane

228
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,270
in the top it's exactly the same picture

229
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,430
on both of them they just added the

230
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:50,060
plane but realistically who's afraid of

231
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:53,060
planes you know they crash and they

232
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:57,370
can't even knock over a fence posts well

233
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:02,000
time goes on twenty years later b-25s

234
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,050
take their first flight a pretty pretty

235
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:08,270
big playing much much more significant

236
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,460
than than the biplanes and the the

237
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:14,150
Wright Flyer also 1939 c-45 has its

238
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:18,890
first flight and in 1943 lockheed in a

239
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:23,150
143 days went from paper drawings to

240
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,500
actually having an airframe for the

241
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,120
first jet this is the Lulubell

242
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:33,300
in 1945 a b-25 crashed into the empire

243
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,870
state building the empire state building

244
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,339
is just on just a few blocks away from

245
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:39,779
the Flatiron Building you can see it

246
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:45,149
from there and in 1946 that's c-45 that

247
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:46,649
we saw a few minutes ago and crashed

248
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:51,389
into the tower on Wall Street well we

249
00:10:51,389 --> 00:10:53,699
better go back and refresh our CBS s4 so

250
00:10:53,699 --> 00:10:55,709
we've now got proof of concept that yeah

251
00:10:55,709 --> 00:10:57,209
it is possible for planes to fly in the

252
00:10:57,209 --> 00:11:01,259
building's the there's really no fix for

253
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:03,269
it so it's unavailable but in the report

254
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:06,560
conference confidence is uncorroborated

255
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,759
yeah we've seen it happen but no one's

256
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:12,300
doing this intentionally meanwhile Billy

257
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,949
Joel completely disclaims responsibility

258
00:11:13,949 --> 00:11:17,939
for the fire and we're off to the dawn

259
00:11:17,939 --> 00:11:23,699
of the Space Age 1962 kind of a tense

260
00:11:23,699 --> 00:11:25,560
time around these parts because the

261
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,939
Soviets were putting missiles into Cuba

262
00:11:26,939 --> 00:11:31,819
you might have heard of that meanwhile

263
00:11:31,819 --> 00:11:34,709
there there's we're working on on

264
00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:37,079
Minuteman two rockets and they're having

265
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:38,370
some problems getting them off the

266
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:39,629
ground they're having some problems with

267
00:11:39,629 --> 00:11:45,209
failures during launch and Boeing comes

268
00:11:45,209 --> 00:11:47,430
up with this method of analysis for it

269
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:49,980
for engineering called fault tree

270
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,050
analysis in which they they have this

271
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:53,819
method that's basically bad thing

272
00:11:53,819 --> 00:11:55,589
happens at the top and then some logic

273
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:58,199
diagram that says here's the possible

274
00:11:58,199 --> 00:11:59,910
reasons that thing could happen and you

275
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,800
can have and and or gates and all this

276
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,410
logic that that explains you know how to

277
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:06,329
analyze this and they start using this

278
00:12:06,329 --> 00:12:08,639
to to analyze rocket accidents and that

279
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,920
that helps them build better better news

280
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:17,579
or better Rockets rather 1967 the Apollo

281
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:23,100
11 a pasar Apollo 1 crew burned to death

282
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,709
in the capsule and in the resulting

283
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:27,750
analysis of that accident fall trees

284
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,699
were used again and this eventually

285
00:12:29,699 --> 00:12:31,529
turns into a publication from Boeing

286
00:12:31,529 --> 00:12:33,540
where they actually describe how to use

287
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,120
fall trees as

288
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,110
as an engineering tool for analyzing

289
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:41,490
analyzing think analyzing accidents

290
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,380
before they happen not afterwards so

291
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,310
they want they want this to be a

292
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:45,990
proactive engineering thing and a way to

293
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:48,480
help you think through problems you can

294
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,170
have with safety that's popular enough

295
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:53,460
that it actually eventually winds up

296
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:57,300
being a Navy FAA publication the

297
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,950
snapshot here is actually from the 2000

298
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,690
version of this pocket publication but

299
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:04,020
the cover is the 1970 version so

300
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,400
aviation starting to catch on to this

301
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,150
whole fault tree thing 1979 a couple

302
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:13,470
miles east of here Three Mile Island has

303
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:16,589
has a bit of an accident and very

304
00:13:16,589 --> 00:13:18,330
quickly the Nuclear Regulatory

305
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,460
Commission comes out with a fall tree

306
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,650
handbook that says hey this works for

307
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,960
aviation we ought to use this for for

308
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,560
analyzing nuclear plants as well

309
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,820
meanwhile back at Boeing they get the

310
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:33,720
767 off the ground in 1982 it happens to

311
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,050
be 300,000 pounds or so takeoff weight

312
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:39,870
and carries about 16,000 gallons of jet

313
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:44,720
fuel a couple years later Union Carbide

314
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,770
has a horrible accident in Bhopal India

315
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:51,060
can still considered one of the worst

316
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,940
the worst industrial accident ever and

317
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,700
going back and analyzing that there were

318
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,620
some folks involved from from OSHA and

319
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,830
other places in the US that that also

320
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,270
were starting to use fall trees to kind

321
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:05,070
of understand how did this happen what

322
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:10,920
what went wrong there NASA 1986 launches

323
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,990
the Challenger Challenger doesn't make

324
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:16,410
it to space the new york times publishes

325
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:20,040
a pretty scathing criticism of of nasa

326
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,570
and says near look they didn't even

327
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,279
bother to do this well established thing

328
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,800
called fault tree analysis to to figure

329
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,340
it out beforehand

330
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:33,240
1988 the piper alpha caught fire in the

331
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:38,370
North Sea this cutout let's see it was

332
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,250
it was a sizable chunk of of the the

333
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,780
North Sea oil production at the time and

334
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:45,870
as a result of that within a few years

335
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:48,270
OSHA actually publishes a process safety

336
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,830
management in which they recommend that

337
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:52,530
you really should be doing you know

338
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:55,260
checklists and failure mode and effects

339
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,570
analysis and fault tree analysis as part

340
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:00,120
of urine out your overall safety prog

341
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,500
program so we've caught up to the last

342
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,980
20 years this is New York City by the

343
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,690
way the plank the building that the the

344
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:11,430
sea 45 flew into is down at the bottom

345
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:16,820
left right next to the act 3 there and

346
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:20,850
1999 Bruce Schneier publishes a article

347
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:23,490
in dr. Dobbs saying that you know hey

348
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,680
Engineering has these fault tree things

349
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,540
and wouldn't it be neat if we could use

350
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,520
those as attack trees and so they

351
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,680
basically takes that that same model of

352
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,050
bad thing happens reason a reason reason

353
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:36,210
logic diagram thing and you can start

354
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,770
talking about it's just to make

355
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:43,200
systematic attacks conveniently a couple

356
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,120
years later some folks at cert actually

357
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,800
flush some of that out and they

358
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,350
published an article talking about how

359
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:52,320
to how attack modeling can happen and

360
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,570
how you can use that sort of logic in in

361
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:59,670
describing security attacks of course

362
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:02,460
same year we actually do finally see the

363
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,800
demonstration weaponized exploit of

364
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,360
three hundred fifteen thousand pounds of

365
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,860
aluminum filled with kerosene flying

366
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,210
into a building and completely

367
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,490
destroying it the temporary fix for that

368
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:14,640
is that you go from this at eight thirty

369
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,530
in the morning to this at noon you

370
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:21,540
ground all the flights you put put all

371
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,319
the Jets on the ground

372
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:27,890
so we've got a temporary fix we've

373
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:31,670
confirmed the report and we've got we

374
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,690
also know that there's a functional

375
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:35,000
exploit our overall our base score still

376
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,850
6.5 but our overall score is now up at

377
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:43,940
7.9 very quickly we come up with a more

378
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:47,180
permanent fix which is don't let planes

379
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,220
fly near buildings shoot them down if

380
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:54,950
necessary so now we've got we got an

381
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,450
official fix so we went from now the

382
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,460
temperate the temporal score drops back

383
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:02,600
from 7.99 27.8 so very serious

384
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,790
vulnerability but you know we've got

385
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,650
when we don't sort of know how to deal

386
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:13,040
with it also in 2002 NASA finally

387
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,449
publishes the fall tree handbook with

388
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:16,939
aerospace applications and I don't

389
00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:17,990
expect anyone to actually read the eye

390
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:19,640
chart here but the main point is not

391
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,189
only they have diagrams they have math

392
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:22,910
remember that I'm going to come back to

393
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:26,859
it in a second two thousand three

394
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:30,020
colombia sadly fails to make the return

395
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:33,740
flight from space and this time around

396
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,590
the New York Times says NASA is going to

397
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,720
do fault tree analysis to to help figure

398
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,550
that out and whether or not the heat

399
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,770
heat shedding tiles would be one of that

400
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:47,120
one branch of that tree so by 2009 NASA

401
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,740
is really on board with this fault tree

402
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,120
analysis thing they say it's one of the

403
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,490
most important logic and probabilistic

404
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:55,250
techniques capable of uncovering design

405
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,170
and operational weaknesses that escape

406
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:59,240
even some of the best deterministic

407
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:03,280
safety and engineering experts meanwhile

408
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,080
on Microsoft community blog in 2012 and

409
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,520
this was actually written by somebody

410
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,810
who didn't work for Microsoft but he's

411
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:12,470
like a publishing a guest article on the

412
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:16,550
blog part of which is actually to talk

413
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:18,410
about why Emmet is a good thing and I

414
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:20,180
agree them it's a great thing but his

415
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,980
point here was that attack trees are

416
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,810
difficult to follow visually and too

417
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:27,590
labor-intensive now this made me pause

418
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:30,050
for a second because NASA's thinking

419
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:33,450
about fault trees as math

420
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,970
they're thinking about attack trees as

421
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:38,820
Visio diagrams now one of those is

422
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,799
amenable to analysis and you can like

423
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,870
you can figure things out with it the

424
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:45,570
other one you can draw pictures hey

425
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:47,549
something's not quite lining up here

426
00:18:47,549 --> 00:18:49,169
like we there's a lot of it there's a

427
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,490
lot of attack there's a lot of fall tree

428
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:52,470
stuff that is going on that the attack

429
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,480
hasn't really transferred over to the

430
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,830
attack tree threat modeling side of

431
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:59,610
things all right so let's bring this

432
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:02,580
back to actual like security stuff so I

433
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:06,240
work it's at cert we do vulnerability

434
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,010
discovery one of the you know I work on

435
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,450
fuzzing software that finds

436
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:13,740
vulnerabilities and things and the one

437
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:17,460
the one idea that I can get across for

438
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,809
how you find vulnerabilities and systems

439
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:21,990
is you have what you expect to happen

440
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,940
and what really happens so there's what

441
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,559
what you think the software does and

442
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:28,769
what the software actually does and you

443
00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:31,470
find vols in the places where reality it

444
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,929
doesn't match up with your expectations

445
00:19:32,929 --> 00:19:36,870
so any vulnerability you've ever

446
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,789
encountered probably fits this diagram

447
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:40,620
and if it doesn't I'm curious to hear a

448
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,750
life I haven't found any yet that don't

449
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,470
really fall into that into this scenario

450
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:49,200
so given that let's talk about this idea

451
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,779
of build security in great idea if you

452
00:19:51,779 --> 00:19:56,940
can do it do it when exactly should the

453
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,260
people who built the Flatiron Building

454
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,789
have built those defenses in against

455
00:19:59,789 --> 00:20:02,340
planes because remember when they

456
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:06,269
started it was sci-fi no one expected

457
00:20:06,269 --> 00:20:08,669
that that was going the plane that

458
00:20:08,669 --> 00:20:13,350
planes were going to be a thing in in

459
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:15,389
world war 1 planes weren't that big of a

460
00:20:15,389 --> 00:20:17,190
deal in World War two we demonstrated

461
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,510
that you could that building is would

462
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:21,659
survive plane crashes on twice in New

463
00:20:21,659 --> 00:20:24,269
York City right in plain view of the

464
00:20:24,269 --> 00:20:27,389
building or trying to protect you know

465
00:20:27,389 --> 00:20:29,880
at some point seems like somebody should

466
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,990
have done something but I don't I don't

467
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,039
think there's any point where you could

468
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:33,570
have built the security in to that

469
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:36,690
system so realistically how harshly

470
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:38,399
should you judge the people who declined

471
00:20:38,399 --> 00:20:40,470
to defend against threats that even

472
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,240
science fiction hadn't really talked

473
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,899
about when the system was deployed

474
00:20:45,899 --> 00:20:49,419
so to take away on this is that

475
00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:51,190
vulnerabilities can arise because the

476
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:54,519
world changes around the system even if

477
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:56,379
the system itself is just sitting there

478
00:20:56,379 --> 00:20:57,700
minding its own business and remains

479
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:01,119
unchanged now that's that's an

480
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:02,830
interesting point and it kind of a neat

481
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,779
observation but where does it become a

482
00:21:04,779 --> 00:21:08,230
problem well dan gear talking at the NSA

483
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:12,970
about a year ago was was talking about

484
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:15,159
embedded systems with without remote

485
00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:17,259
management and long-lived so you

486
00:21:17,259 --> 00:21:18,669
couldn't patch them but they're going to

487
00:21:18,669 --> 00:21:23,200
be out there forever so long-lived and

488
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,399
not reachable long-lived and not

489
00:21:24,399 --> 00:21:27,369
patchable like that's that's kind of the

490
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,720
same problem is putting a building in

491
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,240
place and technology advances and

492
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,769
advances and advances and eventually you

493
00:21:32,769 --> 00:21:34,480
wind up with vulnerabilities that are

494
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,740
present because not because of the

495
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,029
building change but because the world

496
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:40,499
changed around it i OT and and

497
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,879
long-lived systems are kind of have the

498
00:21:42,879 --> 00:21:48,129
same problem so with that in mind that

499
00:21:48,129 --> 00:21:49,330
you know how long how long do you expect

500
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:52,720
your next refrigerator to last and how

501
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,919
about your next car how about your light

502
00:21:56,919 --> 00:22:00,399
bulbs so you can buy Philips hue light

503
00:22:00,399 --> 00:22:02,619
bulbs on Amazon their hundred bucks or

504
00:22:02,619 --> 00:22:04,330
something for three they come with this

505
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:05,559
little hockey puck that you plug into

506
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:10,389
your network the bulbs have a 15,000 our

507
00:22:10,389 --> 00:22:14,070
lifetime use the warranty is two years

508
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,820
how long do you think you gonna be able

509
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:20,889
to get patches for that so so the

510
00:22:20,889 --> 00:22:22,419
lifespan you know the bulb is like 10

511
00:22:22,419 --> 00:22:24,610
years so how long you be like it patches

512
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:27,129
this is a threat model that I did for

513
00:22:27,129 --> 00:22:29,139
though for that bulb system about a year

514
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:31,330
ago on some work we were doing and we

515
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:32,679
wound up and found that it had a

516
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:34,480
vulnerability which has since been

517
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,519
repaired since been patched in the

518
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:39,820
Philips software interesting thing was

519
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:42,580
it was a vulnerability in the DNS

520
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,649
resolver that made its acceptably cache

521
00:22:44,649 --> 00:22:46,509
poisoning if you guys remember the 2008

522
00:22:46,509 --> 00:22:48,909
Kaminski bug there's actually some

523
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,070
things that go back as you know over a

524
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:53,619
decade and it turns out that the DNS

525
00:22:53,619 --> 00:22:56,559
code that was in that was from an IP

526
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:57,840
stack written by a

527
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,880
I back in like the early 2000s he open

528
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,980
sourced it and then it never got touched

529
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,110
again so we actually wound up and found

530
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:06,090
this vault by looking at the hue stuff

531
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:07,620
but it turns out it was actually in the

532
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,419
IP stack which is in other operating

533
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:11,990
systems like kontiki which is this IOT

534
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,460
operating system we reported it we took

535
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,100
care of it everything but I don't think

536
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,409
Phillips is really planning on a 10 year

537
00:23:19,409 --> 00:23:21,000
lifespan of patching vowels in their

538
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,390
software in their light bulbs so what

539
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:25,890
are we going to do about this well if

540
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:27,360
you're building these counting systems

541
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,590
you're building IOT things you're

542
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,809
building control systems you know

543
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:33,450
anything that has a physical life span

544
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:36,779
that's measured in decades or long long

545
00:23:36,779 --> 00:23:40,049
time frame you know please design for

546
00:23:40,049 --> 00:23:41,730
adaptability to environments that become

547
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:45,179
more hostile over time second point here

548
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:48,210
is that threat modeling and attacked

549
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:51,419
reanalysis have a lot to learn from the

550
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:53,279
folks that do safety analysis safety

551
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,750
people understand fault trees they

552
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,460
understand failure modes effect analysis

553
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,659
it all sorts of things that you can talk

554
00:23:57,659 --> 00:24:00,690
to them about and part of what we've

555
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,970
failed to do so far is get the point

556
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:06,240
across that when you when you bolt a

557
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,370
network stack on to a thing that's been

558
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:10,169
engineered for safety you may not be

559
00:24:10,169 --> 00:24:12,600
safe anymore like I don't think you can

560
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,640
be safe without being secure without the

561
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,289
security if you've got those two things

562
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:20,390
put together so that conversation fine

563
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:22,730
that conversation needs to happen and

564
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:25,470
it's about it's about us you know the

565
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:28,409
security folks starting to talk to maybe

566
00:24:28,409 --> 00:24:29,730
starting with the safety people starting

567
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:30,809
with the engineering people but talking

568
00:24:30,809 --> 00:24:32,789
in a way that they can understand this

569
00:24:32,789 --> 00:24:36,090
is why this is important and if you know

570
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:38,250
some defense mechanism if you feel

571
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,779
upgradability is really important like

572
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:40,980
you should be able to upgrade things

573
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,440
after they're deployed layered defenses

574
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,899
planned obsolescence stuff that's out

575
00:24:45,899 --> 00:24:48,240
there for too long the world may change

576
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,190
enough that it's no it's not possible to

577
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:53,039
secure it anymore also read more science

578
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:57,630
fiction so we've got a few a few

579
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,789
projects at cert that are kind of

580
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:02,100
hitting in this space I already

581
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,360
mentioned the vulnerability discovery

582
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,980
and our systemic vulnerability programs

583
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,240
where we're really trying to reach out

584
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,659
more less less to the the traditional

585
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:11,290
software

586
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:14,710
more to the people who are recent

587
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:16,210
they're relatively new to the internet

588
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:17,320
connected stuff but they've been

589
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,640
engineering stuff for a while so we're

590
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,490
trying to have that conversation you

591
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:24,030
know on automotive or industrial control

592
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:26,470
IOT medical devices all all of those

593
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:28,360
fronts there's also some work going on

594
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,640
at the sei on model-driven architecture

595
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,190
which can actually emit fault tree

596
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:38,680
analysis from architectural models so

597
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,670
how do they get the idea for this

598
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,620
presentation this is the view from my

599
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,870
office at CMU back when I was at the

600
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:47,260
other building and if you ever noticed

601
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,580
if you're outside in Pittsburgh for very

602
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,550
long these kc-135s were always flying

603
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,460
around town and from the perspective I

604
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,690
had they were always it always looked

605
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:56,980
like they were flying behind a cathedral

606
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:57,880
of learning I would just sit there one

607
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,920
day and like wait those planes are newer

608
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,660
than the but than the building but the

609
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:02,410
building doesn't have any defenses

610
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:04,390
against them and that would be bad so

611
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:06,090
that kind of just got me digging into

612
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:09,970
looking for buildings that predated the

613
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:11,920
Wright brothers flight and the Flatiron

614
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,770
Building happened to be one conveniently

615
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:17,020
it had had the the Pittsburgh

616
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:19,030
connections to go along with it but

617
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:21,990
that's that's the origin of this story

618
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,710
hopefully gave you some things to think

619
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:25,900
about and I'm happy for any questions if

620
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,080
you got

621
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:49,140
what

622
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:53,980
so there are the folks that are doing

623
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,780
fault tree analysis already already are

624
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,580
doing like probabilistic assessments and

625
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,380
like they can do calculations and things

626
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:02,530
on those trees the the issue the big

627
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:03,730
difference between fault trees and

628
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:05,919
attack trees isn't they're both exactly

629
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:07,870
the same logical construct the

630
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:10,600
difference is that with an attack tree

631
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,309
you're you've got an intelligent

632
00:27:12,309 --> 00:27:13,720
adversary you're not just trying to

633
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,600
defeat physics chemistry and probability

634
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,540
of accidental failures so we can talk

635
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,740
about mean time to failure on a

636
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,330
mechanical components we can't talk

637
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:25,299
about me Kent is easily talk about how

638
00:27:25,299 --> 00:27:28,120
probable is an attack today right so

639
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,549
yeah it's possible to propagate it

640
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:32,140
through but some of the difficulty there

641
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:34,530
is just understanding those differences

642
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:37,600
I'm not I'm not suggesting that you know

643
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,700
we're stupid for not having noticed this

644
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,169
whole thing over here I'm just really

645
00:27:41,169 --> 00:27:42,429
just kind of trying to point out that

646
00:27:42,429 --> 00:27:44,169
you know there's this body of knowledge

647
00:27:44,169 --> 00:27:46,030
that already exists that if we could

648
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,740
figure out how to map our problem on to

649
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,120
that not only we have a good

650
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,350
conversation with those people we also

651
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:52,299
may be able to improve security analysis

652
00:27:52,299 --> 00:27:53,980
as well as the analysis of these other

653
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,250
things

654
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:03,270
even-even we can confirm the threat or

655
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:06,370
fictional small is not really heavily

656
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:08,950
infected so is that apparently a problem

657
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:11,760
CBS SS

658
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:16,790
that there isn't enough like everything

659
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,620
has to be absolute one of these three

660
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:26,570
things so the I think I think

661
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:29,180
pigeonholing does definitely happens

662
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:33,110
with CBS s in terms of the yeah

663
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,400
everything has to fall into a certain

664
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,370
category there's currently work through

665
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:41,240
first to come up with CBS s v3 first

666
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,440
conference is happening this week as

667
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,760
well so i'm not sure where that's where

668
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,960
that's going to land at the end of this

669
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,740
week but so CBS s v3 is coming it does

670
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,870
have some improvements to the CVS sv2

671
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:52,960
I'm not as familiar with that just yet

672
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,880
and I think I think it does actually

673
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,780
improve some of this so that would be a

674
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,340
little little bit clearer although

675
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,960
there's all there's other criticisms of

676
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,210
CVS sp3 to that you can go read about

677
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:07,100
online there's there's some and they've

678
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,660
broken out a couple category so that

679
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:11,660
it's not you know CBS sp2 is really

680
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:14,090
thinking about the worst thing that can

681
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:16,790
happen is that you own the box CBS s v3

682
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:19,190
starts to think about as well well not

683
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,240
only drew on the box but you might be

684
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,950
able to steal the data and stealing the

685
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:25,130
data gets low scores on CBS s v2 and

686
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:29,920
it'll get higher scores in v3 so

687
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,670
sir

688
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:43,610
are they are the current security

689
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:45,110
methods outdated for the internet of

690
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:52,940
things i think it's i think it's i'm not

691
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:55,820
sure that we scale well enough in our in

692
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:58,610
our processing and we run across even

693
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:01,400
with android apps we found 24,000

694
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,610
vulnerable android apps last year and

695
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:06,110
that just about broke everything in the

696
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,190
coordinated vulnerability disclosure

697
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:10,850
process and so there's a the more things

698
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:11,990
there are the more problems they're

699
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:12,980
going to be and I don't know that we

700
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,900
necessarily have the ability to fix all

701
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,750
those but more importantly anyone who's

702
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:21,170
involved in in IOT things like it's not

703
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:22,820
so much that our processes are outdated

704
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,470
for security it's that the code you're

705
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:26,390
putting into them may be outdated so

706
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:27,920
you've got binary blobs that already

707
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,740
have IP stacks built into them I found

708
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:33,020
that vxworks just had it was just an ICS

709
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:36,860
to cert alert yesterday vxworks has tcp

710
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:37,700
initial sequence number of

711
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,120
vulnerabilities which we published on in

712
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:45,890
2001-2002 there there are lots of lots

713
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:50,690
of old old old code like pre 1999 you

714
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:51,860
know it forked from they forked

715
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,570
something from g Lib C and then they've

716
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:54,620
gone off and done whatever they've done

717
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,930
but if you go back and look at G loops

718
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:58,310
evolves you can find a whole stack of

719
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,660
them in the last 15 years and none of

720
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,160
them have been patched in these you know

721
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,370
small embedded operating systems so I

722
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:06,560
would definitely go back and ask

723
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,000
questions about where the IP stack came

724
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,410
from where the DNS resolver came from

725
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:11,030
and all of those network vols that we

726
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,500
had over the last 15 years they're all

727
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,820
still there and they're probably going

728
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,380
to come back and show up in this all

729
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:21,400
these IOT devices so thanks oh thanks
