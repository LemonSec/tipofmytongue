1
00:00:02,449 --> 00:00:05,190
let's get started to talk top chefs her

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,109
people have an effective approach to

3
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:14,219
defensive though good morning everyone

4
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:16,859
welcome to besides I know we already did

5
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:18,029
the Welcome with them that I've to do

6
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:21,990
that again so this talk is one of those

7
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,510
talks that is designed to cover a topic

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,390
that is something that can be very

9
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,750
boring if done poorly and pretty much my

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,219
goal with this talk was to come up with

11
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:34,079
something that covered defensive depth

12
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,690
in a way that didn't suck so hopefully

13
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,610
if no one's sleep at the end of this

14
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,040
talk my job well if you're all sleep you

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,620
can have lunch later we'll go with that

16
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,140
but I Tonkov check i'm the senior

17
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,670
security engineer at work in labs who

18
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,399
are based out of cleveland we do spunk

19
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,380
network management all i have fun stuff

20
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,980
and I get the opportunity to reach out

21
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,620
and give presentations also lead our

22
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,329
operations team

23
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:02,309
and it's great to be here so without

24
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:05,009
further ado talk a little bit about

25
00:01:05,009 --> 00:01:06,720
defense in depth this kind of parallels

26
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,930
the talk that happened previously where

27
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,159
we covered some of the pen test

28
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,680
attacking tactics like they said it's

29
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,310
not difficult to break in if you're a

30
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,399
red team your job is easy you just need

31
00:01:20,399 --> 00:01:22,649
to find the little crack at the castle

32
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:25,470
wall and really the whole analogy that

33
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,960
I'm going with this presentation the

34
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,140
security castle instead of talking about

35
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,259
you know steer technical things I want

36
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:35,940
to really use this extended analogy of

37
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,110
the castle throughout this entire

38
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:40,259
presentation so all the imagery that

39
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:41,729
we're going to use in this that was

40
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:43,649
created by our designer is going to

41
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:46,830
focus on that whole practice of trying

42
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,840
to make this a medieval theme so I think

43
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,890
that's going to be a little bit more

44
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,390
interesting and different from what you

45
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,560
would normally see at a security

46
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,170
conference presentation so yeah breaking

47
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,610
it is easy

48
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,650
attacker is the only going to find the

49
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:01,200
little crack to get it the tiny hole in

50
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,890
the castle wall there could be a domain

51
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,110
admin account that's of escalated

52
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,690
privileges like we covered previously

53
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,008
there could be a spear phishing attack

54
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:13,410
at a single user and from that point you

55
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:14,820
can pivot to somewhere else in the

56
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,790
network and basically do almost

57
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,350
everything once you find a single

58
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:22,170
vulnerability now on the blue team side

59
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,410
which is a lot of my specialty you are

60
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,030
having to struggle with trying to defend

61
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,490
all that and trying to deal with all the

62
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,320
different possible ways and attacking it

63
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,060
in and they only define the look thing

64
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,739
that you must which really kind of

65
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:38,489
stinks so we need to try to find a way

66
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:40,470
to leverage our defenses in such a way

67
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:43,709
that we protect the fortress that is our

68
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:46,470
company's infrastructure and defensive

69
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,280
dump is the way to do that

70
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,380
one of the things that I see all too

71
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,240
often is we have our existing controls

72
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,180
we have firewalls we have security

73
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,510
software we have web application for

74
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,940
filters we have you know all these

75
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,620
defenses that are layered on top of each

76
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,470
other and then we also want to say you

77
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,610
know there's this new shiny new

78
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,200
technology that comes out I really want

79
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,750
to spend money to buy that too all too

80
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,489
often though the existing controls that

81
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:14,500
we have are not optimized in such a way

82
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,970
that they are the most effective at

83
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,250
defending something we have more

84
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,290
configuration on our firewalls we have

85
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,540
any rules that allow all kinds of

86
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,810
traffic we're having vulnerable client

87
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:28,330
applications and vulnerable plugins and

88
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,970
all of these work together to kind of

89
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,100
defeat the defense's that we have and

90
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,660
then we're looking at spending more

91
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,080
money and putting more defenses in and

92
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,970
just really not being effective to use

93
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,239
what we have and I understand that you

94
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:44,650
know there's always the cool shiny new

95
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,170
security thing

96
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:48,480
everyone has pushes for all creating

97
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,220
that using that but we can do more with

98
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,440
what we have so really one of my goals

99
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,390
in this presentation is not to say hey

100
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,830
you guys need to go spend more money on

101
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:58,260
something because i understand i come

102
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,300
from a security vendor and part of our

103
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,060
job is to have people buy services and

104
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,709
things and all that but that's not what

105
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:06,270
i'm trying to go for use the controls

106
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:09,180
that you have and try to use them to be

107
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,760
more effective and defender

108
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:15,320
infrastructure in your castle perfect so

109
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,310
spending more on security of course

110
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,389
doesn't mean that you're going to get

111
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:21,570
more security and really by minimizing

112
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:24,630
your costs and kinda like echoing from

113
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,340
our pervious talk to keep going back on

114
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,979
that use the free methods use the tools

115
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:31,669
that are available to first make a case

116
00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:34,530
politically for ultimately spending more

117
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:35,880
money on something that you could use

118
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,970
down the road but start small and then

119
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:40,880
go from there

120
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,380
so this is where I want to introduce the

121
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,410
concept of Defense enough the layers of

122
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,660
Defense's I pop up each other to better

123
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:51,820
defend the organization's crown jewels

124
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,770
and really the concept of defensive

125
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,600
depth is the idea of layers of

126
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,370
protection and this is where we go to

127
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:00,100
the castle team you can think of your

128
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,620
organization as a castle and you have

129
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,590
different forms of assets in this castle

130
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:08,080
in the castle you have gold which is

131
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,270
obviously a very tangible asset you have

132
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,280
the people who are living in the castle

133
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,830
because the castle was the kind of like

134
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,730
the premier defense of its time you had

135
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,920
the peasants who lived in there the

136
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,140
servants you had the fair maiden you

137
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,340
didn't want anything bad to happen to

138
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:27,910
her so we protect all these parts of the

139
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,520
castle and we use layers of protection

140
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,650
we have the boat that's the background

141
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:35,560
there's the big walls there's guards all

142
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,290
these defenses work together to make the

143
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:40,840
castle the premier defense of its time

144
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,230
and we should think of our defense in

145
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,490
our organization the same one

146
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:48,620
so one of the principles that our

147
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,300
security people like to talk about until

148
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,620
we're blue in the face of the idea at

149
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,620
least access we're all forms of access

150
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,349
are completely in tightly control do you

151
00:05:57,349 --> 00:05:59,870
talk it doesn't happen but it's

152
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,630
something we should strive for users and

153
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,310
administrators they should only have the

154
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,380
access they need to do their jobs if

155
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,090
your administrators are doing

156
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,530
administration work that's when they

157
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,030
would escalate their privileges to a

158
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,099
role where they have administrative

159
00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:15,560
permissions otherwise they would be

160
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,750
running as normal users kind of reducing

161
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,289
the risk of that now we usually think of

162
00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:23,180
this as an admin or as a user

163
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,490
perspective limit what your users can do

164
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:28,819
but yeah the way that we want to do this

165
00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:31,069
on organizations to have our admins be

166
00:06:31,069 --> 00:06:32,780
wondered as well and only use

167
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,400
administrative provisions when they need

168
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,139
them that's also important

169
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:38,449
of what this does is it reduces the

170
00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:40,580
scope of an account when you're doing

171
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,259
your spear phishing attacks and sending

172
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:45,110
out your emails to try to tap users most

173
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,729
of the time it's not necessarily going

174
00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:48,259
to be an admin like we said previously

175
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:50,479
it's going to be someone who is just

176
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,270
going to be your average user if your

177
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,580
average users are domain admin god help

178
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,520
you pretty much because everything is

179
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,900
just going to be able to go downhill

180
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,389
from there however if your average users

181
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:04,310
don't have permissions to install

182
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:07,490
software or do other changes to your

183
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:09,229
infrastructure you're going to be more

184
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:11,710
likely to have those users not

185
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:13,789
compromise the systems the same way as

186
00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:17,110
an admin compromised

187
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,310
then we into the idea firewalls this is

188
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:25,030
the outside defense of your castle and I

189
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:27,370
know there's been talks recently about

190
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:29,260
firewalls being less relevant and less

191
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,500
useful and that's that's not true

192
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,910
castles they had your big walls you had

193
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,919
your moats you had those defenses they

194
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,320
were there for a reason um and pretty

195
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,290
much what the castle was designed to do

196
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,720
was funnel all the traffic into a single

197
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,669
point of entry that was well protected

198
00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:48,070
but it was known and observed as a

199
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,860
vulnerability you had the drawbridge you

200
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:54,310
had the guards there you had the polls

201
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,830
real good pour boiling oil and shoot

202
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,690
arrows down at the bad people that's

203
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:01,480
that's what your firewalls doing castles

204
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,400
they didn't have multiple entries they

205
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,140
weren't shopping malls where you can

206
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,060
come and go as you please everything was

207
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,100
well controlled your organization should

208
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,840
be handled the same way for network

209
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,120
traffic anyone that's coming in and he

210
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,440
traffics that's coming in should get

211
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,780
expected inspected it should be decided

212
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,270
hey as the service allowed to talk to

213
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,449
the server

214
00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:23,400
using the firewall is really the best

215
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,919
way to do that at the outside and the

216
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,939
initial defense put by itself it's not

217
00:08:28,939 --> 00:08:31,800
necessarily going to be the best way to

218
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,049
secure a system because firewalls can

219
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:37,130
get bypassed easily

220
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:40,159
a lot of times what we think about is

221
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,450
firewalls being more than just all too

222
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:46,250
often you think you see incoming traffic

223
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,100
for your firewall it's more than just

224
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,830
incoming incoming traffic you also have

225
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,270
outbound filtering that you need to

226
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:55,790
consider for my rules so let's just say

227
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,470
someone passes the inspection of the

228
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,870
castle eight they walk through they get

229
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,160
checked by the guards you know the

230
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,980
medieval Copeland of the TSA Pat's them

231
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,010
down they get the go-ahead they're in

232
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:09,050
the castle should they be allowed to do

233
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,820
everything they want let's say they saw

234
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,320
some gold and wanted to put that in

235
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,810
their pocket let's say they really liked

236
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:16,580
the fair maiden and wanted to run off

237
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:19,250
and write the medieval bones of a tailer

238
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:22,400
football you know pretty much that's up

239
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,690
not something you want to have happen

240
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,490
you want to have that inspected when you

241
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,890
clean the firewall as well which would

242
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:32,270
be at the castle gate so what I see and

243
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:34,340
this is less and less common but a lot

244
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,260
of organizations still allow everything

245
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,570
to go out of their network the firewall

246
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:40,820
will check what comes in but if you're

247
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,680
allowed to make a communication outcome

248
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,030
that's just going to be a lot about

249
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,610
affordable

250
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,709
that makes the job of someone trying to

251
00:09:47,709 --> 00:09:50,980
exfiltrate data easy it makes exploits

252
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,750
really work well because they don't have

253
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,910
to worry about expecting about

254
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,890
conductivity and you just hit whatever

255
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:59,890
they want so don't assume that

256
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,269
everything leaving your neck while

257
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:03,790
network is legitimate just like you

258
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,470
don't assume everything coming into your

259
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,860
network is legitimate

260
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,990
and really just by restricting access

261
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:12,410
you can stop a lot of some of the basic

262
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:15,350
and not specialized network from being

263
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,750
effective because there is a lot of

264
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,430
malware that will still try to connect

265
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:22,010
outbound on I boards Plus comment you're

266
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,600
going to see a lot more in HTTP and

267
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,120
HTTPS anymore because that's pretty much

268
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,950
going to be more likely to be allowed

269
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:30,260
but there is a lot of the legacy stuff

270
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,030
that will still try to communicate up on

271
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,810
them hi ports

272
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,389
also you have the idea of intrusion

273
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:40,279
detection and Prevention in the castle

274
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:42,290
analogy these are your guards and your

275
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:45,920
alarms essentially your guards and your

276
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,360
soldiers they would see something that

277
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,579
was going on they'd sound the alarm and

278
00:10:49,579 --> 00:10:52,639
these would be indicators of there being

279
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:55,009
a threat or potential problems well

280
00:10:55,009 --> 00:10:57,019
before that just actually was something

281
00:10:57,019 --> 00:10:59,750
that happened things to bear in mind

282
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,089
though with IDs and ids not everything

283
00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:04,310
is in prep you could have people who

284
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:07,399
were walking by your castle in medieval

285
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:09,110
teenagers they pick up a rock they throw

286
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,639
it at the wall to guess oh that's not a

287
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:13,639
problem that's a pork scam same thing

288
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,379
that you say you know do you want to get

289
00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:17,269
alerted about everything that happens

290
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:19,399
against your firewall you're outside IP

291
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:22,519
range that is potentially somehow back

292
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:26,899
to something no you never sleep so a lot

293
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:28,310
of times what I see is you'll get a

294
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:30,439
report of all the IDS activity on our

295
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,300
network and it's like this long and it's

296
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,879
like for scans bad stuff you know all of

297
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:36,649
that stuff is not necessarily things you

298
00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:38,509
need to worry about you need to worry

299
00:11:38,509 --> 00:11:40,250
about things that you're vulnerable to

300
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,740
so in the case of the castle analogy

301
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,420
let's just say the guards noticed an

302
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:49,030
attack coming in from CBE 1426 cannon

303
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:52,540
the candidate was a vulnerability or it

304
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,610
was something that would the castle was

305
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,530
vulnerable to that's what made castles

306
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:59,680
obsolete so if an attacker was coming at

307
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,350
a castle with a cannon there would be

308
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,700
problems and that would be something

309
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,870
that the guards would need to take

310
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,970
action to that's exactly how we should

311
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:10,150
handle IDs and IPS we should be alerting

312
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,590
and responding to things that our

313
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,930
infrastructure is vulnerable to and not

314
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,940
necessarily caring about the guy who's

315
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,160
throwing a rock at the wall who is not

316
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,760
really at birth

317
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,350
also there's the idea of network

318
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:28,830
segmentation once inside the castle you

319
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,510
should just have free reign of

320
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:33,180
everything in the castle there are

321
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,740
different roles and different

322
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,930
responsibilities in there obviously the

323
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,480
nights are going to be having more

324
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,140
access in the castle and others but even

325
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,000
in the case let's just say the fair

326
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,589
maiden again you don't want the Knights

327
00:12:46,589 --> 00:12:49,410
to be able to spend too much time there

328
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:50,730
is it might be able to walk by and say

329
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:53,310
something like hello the peasants they

330
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,290
don't got a chance even so they would be

331
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:59,010
segmented off same way not that we're

332
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:01,770
calling users cousins but similar idea

333
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:04,050
they would not be able to access

334
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:06,330
everything in the network they shouldn't

335
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:08,970
be able to log into servers that they

336
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:11,400
don't need to access and the Knights

337
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,500
could be your system administrators they

338
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,000
still don't need to be able to access

339
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,610
everything your DBA might need to be

340
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:19,320
able access databases but they should be

341
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,930
able to manage your corporate website

342
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:23,490
those sorts of course operation of roles

343
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:25,770
tool in the event of a user getting

344
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:27,360
compromised they won't be able to do

345
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,130
every single thing on a network at a

346
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:31,370
time

347
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,590
the way that this usually works is with

348
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:38,850
DMZ s where you have servers separated

349
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,470
on different networks according to roll

350
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:42,600
and then you can use the firewall or

351
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,760
some other device to separate that

352
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,190
traffic so in the case of this example

353
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:49,440
you have a web server that needs to talk

354
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,820
to a database more often than not your

355
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,230
web server and database are going to be

356
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,850
running on separate systems if they're

357
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,440
not on the same system this isn't going

358
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,350
to be as practical but what you can do

359
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,790
in this case is you can allow the

360
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,890
incoming traffic to the web server and

361
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:07,380
then the web server can be allowed to

362
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,390
talk to the database server and the

363
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,980
firewall rules can be written in such a

364
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,200
way that the web server is only allowed

365
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,300
to communicate to the database server on

366
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,850
those ports not everything else than the

367
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,500
network can talk to the database server

368
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,770
and the internet cannot talk directly to

369
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:25,530
database server so what this requires

370
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,660
someone to do is to come in through the

371
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,750
firewall and exploit the web server

372
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,070
which isn't that difficult

373
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,930
and then use that access to pivot into

374
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:37,120
the database so you at least put an

375
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,580
extra step in there and then not

376
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,500
everyone in the organization has access

377
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,990
to the database server so you're

378
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:46,000
separating these goals and making it the

379
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,550
adapters life harder so you don't have

380
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,620
automatic access to this and they might

381
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,840
overlook this access depending on how

382
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,180
they're trying to exfiltrate data or

383
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,580
access the network the nice thing about

384
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,410
network segmentation is it's basically

385
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:02,500
free most of the time your firewalls are

386
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,970
already going to support this you're

387
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,350
going to have switching in place to

388
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,990
accomplish this you're just going to

389
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,700
have to sometimes renumber depending on

390
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,590
how it's both out in your network which

391
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,360
can be harder than it looks and sounds

392
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,640
in some cases but it is something that

393
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,890
can be added into an infrastructure with

394
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:21,580
minimal cost and effort it is a change

395
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:24,570
though that has to be made

396
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,600
also it's important to look at fixing

397
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,490
vulnerabilities in your castles that are

398
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:32,420
discovered so stone walls break down

399
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,950
just like the roads in Pittsburgh and

400
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:38,250
Cleveland they ask the weather and the

401
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,320
elements feed down on these things they

402
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,570
need to be patched same thing happens

403
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:46,410
for software your software it gets worn

404
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:48,210
out but there are vulnerabilities that

405
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:50,310
are discovered in it and patching is

406
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:53,610
important and we look at application

407
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:55,440
updates and security updates is kind of

408
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,750
like the necessary evil when you see a

409
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,480
bug before pax that's released for a

410
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,100
software that it's some developer did

411
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,250
something very very horrible and that

412
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,900
very very horrible thing that a

413
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,060
developer did is resulting in the

414
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,710
software being broken in such a way that

415
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,570
it allows some bad guy to do whatever

416
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:15,270
they want with the software so you have

417
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,620
the software application that gets

418
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,360
band-aids slap down and left and right

419
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,830
and I'm really glad I don't have to

420
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:21,390
write software because it just sounds

421
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,980
like a very miserable thing to do how

422
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,470
many threats offer

423
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:30,210
I'm sorry I pity all of you but the fact

424
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:31,710
that you're having all these patches

425
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:33,150
that happen in software these

426
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,650
vulnerabilities that are discovered

427
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,570
you're going to have to do updates all

428
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,640
the time not just your application not

429
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,620
just your operating system updates like

430
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,660
the patch tuesday ones but you also have

431
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,420
your adobe updates your if you have to

432
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,370
run java those job updates that are in

433
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:49,980
there those are a lot of the primary

434
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,830
targets for attacks when you have a

435
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,480
spear phishing attack trying to get

436
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,550
someone to click on a link in a web page

437
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,320
a lot of times they're going to be

438
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,970
directed to what's called an exploit hit

439
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:01,830
page and that just basically as a

440
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:04,109
cookbook of every possible exploit

441
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:05,970
thrown out of power user who happens to

442
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:08,520
go there more often than not they're

443
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,930
going to be exploiting browser

444
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:12,180
vulnerabilities plug-in vulnerabilities

445
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:15,030
if you have any sort of vulnerable

446
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:17,640
plug-in or browser or application these

447
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,290
exploit kits are designed to find those

448
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:20,940
and find a way to get into the network

449
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,560
and then allow the machine to make an

450
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,480
app on connection so that the attacker

451
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,630
has a command and control channel

452
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,700
by fixing some of these vulnerabilities

453
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,530
at least that no one's you're reducing

454
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:32,270
the scope and effectiveness of those

455
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:34,760
automated tide pools targeted attack is

456
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,800
going to be a lot more effective but

457
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,840
most of the attacks that you'd see are

458
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,180
going to be the basic spread a wide net

459
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,560
across the internet and see what you can

460
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,730
catch the other thing just to go back to

461
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,230
fixing vulnerabilities you do need to

462
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:52,040
run supported software this is less of

463
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,690
the case now but I'm sure we're still

464
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,460
seeing XP in two thousand machines

465
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:58,220
laying around they don't get security

466
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:01,720
updates so we run into the same problems

467
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,610
now also web proxies this is a little

468
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:07,370
bit less common but it is a really great

469
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,140
way for reducing some of the

470
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,840
vulnerabilities that you see without

471
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,340
bound traffic so what the proxy does is

472
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,440
it basically goes in between the

473
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,360
computer connecting the internet and the

474
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,670
internet itself and you're forcing all

475
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,920
the software on the computer to go

476
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,840
through the proxy as opposed to having a

477
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,730
direct connection to the internet

478
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:31,880
this can have really significant impact

479
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,429
on the success of that one because a lot

480
00:18:34,429 --> 00:18:36,260
of nowhere is not designed in such a way

481
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,179
that it's proxy aware it assumes that

482
00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:39,080
it's going to have a direct connection

483
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,760
to the internet and be able to get out

484
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:44,059
and talk to everything unfortunately a

485
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:45,950
lot of applications aren't proxy aware

486
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,750
so it is an administrative overhead to

487
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,360
do this but by adding the layer of

488
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,520
having a web proxy in place you really

489
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,140
are making a lot of malware less

490
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,540
effective and it does significantly

491
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:59,390
improve your security combining the

492
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:02,570
proxy without filtering a lot of your

493
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,880
type of commanding control malware is

494
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,890
going to not work as effectively or at

495
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:07,820
least you're going to have a way to

496
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:10,820
detect them so that you can take action

497
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,380
as quickly as possible when it's

498
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,890
detected

499
00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:17,980
also there's the idea of the application

500
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,509
layer firewall which is sometimes

501
00:19:19,509 --> 00:19:22,450
referred to as a reverse proxy what we

502
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,399
understand in this case is that web

503
00:19:24,399 --> 00:19:26,049
application is things that are running

504
00:19:26,049 --> 00:19:27,480
on web servers they have vulnerabilities

505
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,950
you run into buffer overflow attacks

506
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:32,879
there's cross-site scripting there is a

507
00:19:32,879 --> 00:19:36,009
sequel injection that happens all these

508
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:37,509
different types of attacks and

509
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:40,509
vulnerabilities exist in applications

510
00:19:40,509 --> 00:19:43,119
and sometimes you can't necessarily fix

511
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:45,369
them you know you told me in perfect

512
00:19:45,369 --> 00:19:47,470
world your web applications wouldn't

513
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:48,789
have vulnerabilities and when they're

514
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:51,009
discovered the developers would be able

515
00:19:51,009 --> 00:19:54,009
to solve all the problems but looking at

516
00:19:54,009 --> 00:19:55,299
the poor people who have to write

517
00:19:55,299 --> 00:19:56,799
software that's different than how it

518
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,409
actually works you're getting you run

519
00:19:59,409 --> 00:20:01,179
into cases where the guy who wrote the

520
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:03,399
code isn't there anymore or the

521
00:20:03,399 --> 00:20:06,399
application isn't supported anymore or

522
00:20:06,399 --> 00:20:08,440
we need to get this application

523
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,899
yesterday and you security people are

524
00:20:10,899 --> 00:20:13,239
slowing us down and why do we always

525
00:20:13,239 --> 00:20:14,919
have to do these pet tests that make us

526
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:15,970
look bad

527
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:18,280
I do that from different customers all

528
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,380
the time when they're trying to have to

529
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,990
go through the pen desk so from an

530
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,330
application-layer firewall it's kind of

531
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:27,940
a bandaid in a way but it's a way of

532
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,830
putting an additional layer of defense

533
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:32,680
in front of a web server so if the web

534
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,480
application firewall see sequel

535
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,920
injunction coming in it's going to

536
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,480
filter that before it gets to the

537
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,180
vulnerable web app so building these

538
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:43,210
layers on ideally you have good firewall

539
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:45,010
rules at the beginning you have your web

540
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,720
application firewall the filter out some

541
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,700
attacks and then you have a caps web

542
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,650
server that is intolerable to these

543
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:53,080
sorts of things so by layering these in

544
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,300
vernacular failure at one level you have

545
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,880
the ability to better secure people

546
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,660
entire environment

547
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,610
and then there's also the idea of

548
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:06,820
positive access control and the

549
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,410
separation of roles and we touched on

550
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:09,970
this a little bit before but I want to

551
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,460
go in a little bit more about their for

552
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:15,040
example in the castle of the king he

553
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,200
just doesn't cook he doesn't defend the

554
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,910
castle we're not really sure what he

555
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:22,000
does but he's the king but in terms of

556
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,429
the king he shouldn't be able to do

557
00:21:24,429 --> 00:21:27,429
things that require that level access so

558
00:21:27,429 --> 00:21:29,830
he he doesn't need to have access to all

559
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,080
the defenses of the castle he just needs

560
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,580
to be able to tell the people who are

561
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,590
responsible for that to defend the

562
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:38,679
castle instead just like your developer

563
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:41,230
and your application administrators they

564
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,780
shouldn't be able to make firewalls

565
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,580
because bad things will happen you're

566
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,380
going to end up with a lot of any rolls

567
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,809
up you're going to end up with a lot of

568
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:52,390
just open productivity because the

569
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,429
networking side they want things to just

570
00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:56,110
work they don't want to deal with those

571
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,929
pesky security people making the way

572
00:21:57,929 --> 00:22:00,549
your administrators who are dealing with

573
00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:02,350
software a lot of times they don't even

574
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:04,600
know what ports are going to be used for

575
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,919
a service to work through a firewall

576
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,540
which I don't blame them because a lot

577
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,679
of times that people write the software

578
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:10,059
don't know what ports are needed either

579
00:22:10,059 --> 00:22:12,520
so it's kind of a two-way sword on that

580
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:15,940
but really to have that cooperation

581
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,500
between the two sides where your

582
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,600
security team is working with the

583
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,330
networking team an application team and

584
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:22,880
data

585
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,760
administrators so that there is no one

586
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,470
single person who's responsible for

587
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:29,570
making all the exchanges it definitely

588
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:31,100
allows this access to be better

589
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,990
controlled in a larger environment and

590
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:35,540
then really security and IT they should

591
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,660
work together and not against each other

592
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:41,210
so another utopian thought in my head

593
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:45,410
but all too often what I see is security

594
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:47,420
is kind of like the note you can't do

595
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,070
that that's going to make you know

596
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:51,530
things less secure and then security is

597
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:52,880
always going to be like ha now the

598
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,770
business wants me to do this so now we

599
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:56,240
have to break down I was all our

600
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,770
security you guys can relate to that

601
00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:01,640
right the battle that you face instead

602
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,890
of making security the team of no we

603
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,870
can't do that I think we should try to

604
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:08,540
make security the team of the how can we

605
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,550
make that work while still maintaining

606
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:13,550
the security environment understanding

607
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:15,110
that users are going to have to do

608
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,490
things there's going to be unique

609
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:18,940
request that you have to deal with and

610
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:22,100
using that as opportunities to give and

611
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,470
take while allowing the business to

612
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,779
still do their form is

613
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:28,450
which is not security in most cases but

614
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:31,179
to have that buy-in so that everyone

615
00:23:31,179 --> 00:23:33,129
starts thinking from a security

616
00:23:33,129 --> 00:23:35,289
perspective in order to make the

617
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:36,849
security of the organization as a whole

618
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:39,389
better

619
00:23:39,779 --> 00:23:42,619
and then also restricting user access

620
00:23:42,619 --> 00:23:45,629
users general should never run with

621
00:23:45,629 --> 00:23:47,429
administrative access unless they need

622
00:23:47,429 --> 00:23:49,799
it just like administrators shouldn't

623
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:52,080
run with administrative access even when

624
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,269
they need it with the exception of when

625
00:23:54,269 --> 00:23:55,769
they're actually doing an administrative

626
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:59,129
function I've talked to customers who

627
00:23:59,129 --> 00:24:00,840
have moved from the model of having

628
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,729
administrative access everywhere to

629
00:24:02,729 --> 00:24:04,739
customers who have restricted that and

630
00:24:04,739 --> 00:24:07,320
they've really seen a huge drop in the

631
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,210
number of spyware infections and

632
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:10,799
unwanted applications and all that that

633
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,929
have happened there was an initial

634
00:24:12,929 --> 00:24:15,779
period of growing paying for that where

635
00:24:15,779 --> 00:24:17,789
users who were just used to installing

636
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,049
everything had to go through their

637
00:24:19,049 --> 00:24:22,619
service desk for changes and it was you

638
00:24:22,619 --> 00:24:24,749
know an adjustment but after they got

639
00:24:24,749 --> 00:24:26,549
through the initial month or two of

640
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:29,759
dealing with that their effort in the

641
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,409
amount of time that they spent on an IT

642
00:24:31,409 --> 00:24:33,690
perspective of cleaning up our

643
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:35,489
infections and dealing with user

644
00:24:35,489 --> 00:24:37,259
workstation problems it dropped

645
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:39,049
significantly

646
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:40,759
and really that was just by modifying

647
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:42,710
the permissions of what the users were

648
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:45,220
able to do and locking down the access

649
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:48,409
how many of you in your organization try

650
00:24:48,409 --> 00:24:52,970
to restrict user access to that so still

651
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:54,440
a pretty small number how many of you

652
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:58,279
would allow access everywhere oh that's

653
00:24:58,279 --> 00:24:59,700
good

654
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,700
I'd like to see that so

655
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,620
that's the move I want to see as we're

656
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,710
reducing that access for users it

657
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:10,050
doesn't make user less targeted and less

658
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,760
subject to more of these types of

659
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,420
attacks and I see similar results for

660
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,760
you know Citrix users and servers that

661
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,710
are terminal servers the same benefit

662
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:23,280
and really a lot of the IDS alert that

663
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,080
you see in these environments once you

664
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,670
have restricted user access there more

665
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:28,980
informational like an exploit kit was

666
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,690
attempted to run against the client and

667
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:34,080
it failed and that's what you like to

668
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,510
see as a security administrator

669
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:39,520
and yeah client protection is still

670
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,830
something that's very important

671
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,360
antivirus I know it gets a bad rap and

672
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,730
it's not if you have antivirus you're

673
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:47,520
not all your problems are not going away

674
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,310
but you also don't want to not have some

675
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:54,910
kind of flying protection in place also

676
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:56,500
you for your more sensitive applications

677
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,150
you can do some host intrusion

678
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:01,240
protection and defense on basically

679
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,330
trying to see when a host is compromised

680
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:06,670
see one users log into machines and if

681
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:09,190
you see what you failed logins followed

682
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:11,350
by a success that can be an indicator of

683
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:14,020
compromise also there's full disk

684
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,690
encryption as an option for any type of

685
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:18,550
machine that has sensitive information

686
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,380
that might be carried in and out of the

687
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,150
building definitely a good thing to have

688
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:25,030
in place not perfect of course and then

689
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:28,070
Java just sucks

690
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:31,490
but by if you don't have to have job on

691
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,890
machines don't put it on there but

692
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:36,740
unfortunately there are many companies

693
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,450
where your most critical business

694
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:40,610
application was written in Java by some

695
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:41,960
guy who doesn't work there anymore and

696
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,090
no one knows how to change the code so

697
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:46,190
it's there's those problems that you run

698
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:48,350
into to you don't have to have jog on

699
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,850
every machine don't put it on every

700
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:52,820
machine if you have some users that eat

701
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,340
it only put it on those machines

702
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:58,460
restrict that scope as much as possible

703
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,710
so finally I want to wrap things up by

704
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:03,200
bringing everything together a lot of

705
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,850
these recommendations are just that

706
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:07,220
their recommendations depending on what

707
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,900
the organization is doing you might have

708
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,250
some of these in place you might have

709
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:12,470
many of these in place but there might

710
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:14,330
be always areas of improvement in ways

711
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:16,600
that you can layer these defenses better

712
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,130
really what I kinda find is that your

713
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:21,920
smaller type of changes are the ones

714
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,320
that get the most success in

715
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,000
implementation and there the more likely

716
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,710
to get approved in an organization if

717
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:29,840
you wanted to just say hey guys I'm

718
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,190
going to come to work on Monday and turn

719
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:33,590
off all outbound access except for

720
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:36,230
things that I think are important across

721
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:38,120
my entire great position you're probably

722
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,620
going to have your co-workers think

723
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:42,470
you're insane and rightfully so I have

724
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,300
done it before at an organization that

725
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,610
had a bad now or infection and just

726
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:48,080
basically like guys communion shut up

727
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,350
about access they're like okay like what

728
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:53,030
but that actually did a good job at

729
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,680
stopping that type of malware that they

730
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,300
had because it was not going out of

731
00:27:56,300 --> 00:28:00,110
regular HTTP any sports what to try to

732
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:02,300
do that on a big organization it's not

733
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,410
going to be something you're going to be

734
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:06,020
able to do right away but you might be

735
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,390
able to do something like analyzing your

736
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:10,250
log data to see what services are being

737
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:13,640
used and then locking down upon access

738
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,740
to services that are not on that list

739
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,960
and kind of chipping away at the block

740
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,999
and figuring out how your network works

741
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:22,949
that kind of is an approach if you're

742
00:28:22,949 --> 00:28:24,509
not really sure what's being used if you

743
00:28:24,509 --> 00:28:26,519
have documentation and you have a better

744
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:27,749
understanding of how you're not for

745
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:29,009
operates you might be able to do

746
00:28:29,009 --> 00:28:32,399
something differently but really piecing

747
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,799
together and trying to work with what

748
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,409
you can as a security person that gives

749
00:28:37,409 --> 00:28:39,719
you leverage long term as you're trying

750
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:41,639
to sell the position of security of your

751
00:28:41,639 --> 00:28:43,679
organization you have the ability to

752
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,779
demonstrate them to your management that

753
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:47,729
this is what we were able to deal with

754
00:28:47,729 --> 00:28:50,099
the firewall that we have using this

755
00:28:50,099 --> 00:28:52,019
open source IDs we detected these

756
00:28:52,019 --> 00:28:55,409
threats and then you can say okay now

757
00:28:55,409 --> 00:28:57,089
that we've done this work with what we

758
00:28:57,089 --> 00:28:59,399
have now I need more help from you guys

759
00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:00,959
to be able to support this budget

760
00:29:00,959 --> 00:29:03,359
project this new shiny firewall this

761
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:06,299
better client protection system and you

762
00:29:06,299 --> 00:29:08,729
can leverage those together to really

763
00:29:08,729 --> 00:29:11,309
overall benefit your security as an

764
00:29:11,309 --> 00:29:14,279
organization as a whole so with that I'd

765
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:15,809
like to open the floor for questions and

766
00:29:15,809 --> 00:29:18,559
thank you very much

767
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:33,100
Oh question okay

768
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:36,260
they are ones for sale in Europe and

769
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:38,690
they often cost less than a house in new

770
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:41,000
york city or in at least an apartment so

771
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,100
i think there's a list on the internet

772
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,960
I've seen definitely like castles that

773
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,380
cost less than New York City apartments

774
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,460
the problem you run into with that

775
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:52,540
though is Wi-Fi coverage

776
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,770
westinghouse wasn't

777
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:01,380
just put in your boat and scribe with

778
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,900
the ocean of work right thank you

779
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,110
everyone
