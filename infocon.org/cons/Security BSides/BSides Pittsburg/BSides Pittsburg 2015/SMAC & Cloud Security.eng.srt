1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
thanks everybody for letting me speak

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,319
today this is my first time here I'm

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,089
going to change things up a little bit

4
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:08,519
my talk will be a little more conceptual

5
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,759
and hopefully more entertaining so we'll

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:18,240
see how that goes a little bit about

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,390
myself I have infosec career experience

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,699
spanning 20 years I've worked for

9
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:25,680
fortune 50 companies I've worked for

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,119
companies that had 10 employees and I've

11
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:32,340
been in large IT organizations as an

12
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,710
internal team member I've also been an

13
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,300
external consultant and I have a multi

14
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,800
security discipline skills across the

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,079
areas of technical infrastructure design

16
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:45,210
implementation assessment governance

17
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,270
risk and compliance so my goals for this

18
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,700
session I want to share some information

19
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,340
that might be of interest to you

20
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,719
hopefully you'll learn something new and

21
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,430
maybe we'll have some fun along the way

22
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:03,799
as well so smack what is it is this it I

23
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:07,680
might feel like that but smack is

24
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,689
something else now show hands who who

25
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:12,119
here is heard of smack in relation to

26
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:15,470
cloud before anybody got one over here

27
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:19,500
one over there okay Gardner calls this

28
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,080
the nexus of forces what the hell does

29
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,479
that mean nexus of forces doesn't mean

30
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,670
anything to me but smack is social

31
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,500
mobile analytics and cloud that means

32
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,159
something so how big is smack well it's

33
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,880
pretty damn big it's four galaxies in a

34
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,340
universe big how important is it well

35
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:50,100
about a year ago the CEO of Microsoft

36
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,780
decided he needed to change their

37
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,649
go-to-market strategy the previous CEO

38
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:58,100
was calling their new look and feel

39
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,689
devices and services anybody remember

40
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:02,820
that and now he said no that's not good

41
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,799
enough it needs to be cloud first and

42
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,799
mobile first cloud and mobile two parts

43
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:10,500
of smack not sure how you get both of

44
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,520
those to be first but I get the idea

45
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,870
so let's break it down a little bit

46
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,819
these are my definitions of these four

47
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:23,200
areas social media it's represented by

48
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,060
any number of public internet sites that

49
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,489
facilitate personal interaction with a

50
00:02:27,489 --> 00:02:31,090
potentially unlimited audience so who

51
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:34,930
hears heard of litterin that's right I

52
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,100
haven't heard of it either because it

53
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,530
doesn't exist it could exist because

54
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:41,440
it's the mash-up of Facebook LinkedIn

55
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,290
and Twitter and just like this guy you

56
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:46,540
know you can do a whole bunch of things

57
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,000
at one time on flitter in all in one

58
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,019
place and really when you come down to

59
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:55,239
it the social part of smack is all about

60
00:02:55,239 --> 00:03:03,569
the Me's you know you got like me and I

61
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,049
have to read this here it's a little

62
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:11,019
small listen to me army watch me find me

63
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:13,660
so all the B's all the Me's are part of

64
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,690
the social part of smack every one of

65
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,950
yous of me every one of you has

66
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:20,500
different personas so it covers a lot of

67
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:25,450
bases mobile anytime anywhere any device

68
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,100
digital endpoint interactions on a

69
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:32,500
potentially unlimited scale so here's

70
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,970
something that keeps people up at night

71
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,810
we got the people walking up to the BYOD

72
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,730
vending machine and then they go to IET

73
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:42,730
and say hook me up and so there's a

74
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:46,209
tendency to try and lock it down but

75
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:51,010
that really doesn't work analytics also

76
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,720
referred to as big data alludes to the

77
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,600
mashup of data from a variety of sources

78
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,700
that enables extended data mining that

79
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,340
would produce comprehensive information

80
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,420
not otherwise possible think about Big

81
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,890
Data it's pretty scary you don't really

82
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,090
know what you're going to get when you

83
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:11,220
start mashing up data what once was a

84
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,870
data that does not is not attributed to

85
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,819
anybody or any person all of a sudden

86
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:19,690
becomes pH I or PII and again it's very

87
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:23,620
stick it can be very scary stuff not

88
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,110
only that if you take a tool like a doob

89
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:26,560
which is

90
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,260
or the poster child for analytics it

91
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:34,419
takes unique skills it's expensive and

92
00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:36,970
the expectations for the outcomes are

93
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,730
maybe a little too i but guess what

94
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:44,710
we're going there cloud this is a

95
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,419
reference for the classic internet-based

96
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,430
third party resources that are generally

97
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,780
engaging arm's length with a

98
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:54,100
self-service model and just as absurd as

99
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,560
this may seem cloud is the answer to

100
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,770
everything that is the perception in

101
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:01,750
many cases that it's the answer for

102
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,990
every problem that exists so regardless

103
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,630
of how ridiculous that is you better

104
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:11,610
embrace it because this could be you

105
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,639
okay so here's a quick overview of the

106
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:18,430
smack forces working together how they

107
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,500
relate to each other so down in the

108
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,900
bottom right we have the cloud which

109
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,300
provides capacity to the mobile users

110
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:30,789
and to the analytics backends the mobile

111
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:34,120
devices provide social activity to the

112
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,760
social network and in turn the social

113
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,530
network provides social marketing back

114
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:41,530
to the mobile user and analytics is the

115
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:44,140
backend back in engine for all of this

116
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,500
it provides feedback for the voice of

117
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,570
the customer and the mobile activity is

118
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,030
also another source of information into

119
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:56,500
the analytics engine as well so what is

120
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,970
smack matter well business is changing

121
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,669
to a more collaborative customer centric

122
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:05,979
environment align with progressive

123
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:08,229
business strategies so that means that

124
00:06:08,229 --> 00:06:10,810
smack forces will play a strategic role

125
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:13,479
in meeting that change and new and

126
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:16,240
emerging initiatives will likely be will

127
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,060
likely leverage SMAP to get there but

128
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,760
most importantly customers and consumers

129
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:27,729
will demand it to be there so I would

130
00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:32,070
change the information tech landscape

131
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:34,990
well new and unforced unforeseen

132
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,070
security trends will emerge

133
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,290
due to the contemporary variables at

134
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,780
develop because of the new facets of

135
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,430
those four things interacting with each

136
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:46,460
other because of that traditional

137
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,560
security controls will fail to keep pace

138
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,150
and impacts to budget to IT security

139
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,380
product selection and budgeting will be

140
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:59,750
significant in order to keep up so this

141
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,870
wheel moving around from northeast to

142
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:06,560
southwest is basically representing the

143
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,600
notion that as you move around the wheel

144
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,710
your governance control diminishes as

145
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,570
you go from analytics where you can

146
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:17,240
possibly have a lot of control through

147
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,220
things like classification of data and

148
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,190
data tagging and dlp and drm when you

149
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,780
move to cloud you move a little bit

150
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,300
further away from control you can

151
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,290
certify your vendors through procurement

152
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:32,840
processes as you move to social it

153
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,670
starts to get a little more dicey as

154
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:37,580
Telugu who does what when and how and as

155
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,070
you get out to mobile now you're talking

156
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,170
about any device somebody's at home with

157
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,360
their xbox and they need to do something

158
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,100
at work and you know all bets are off on

159
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:50,870
the platform so again in the square in

160
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,570
the middle we talked about for social

161
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:56,480
you can work on increasing your

162
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,150
assurance levels for mobile you there

163
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:02,120
are ways of addressing device and

164
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,710
application management and you can do

165
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:06,530
things like binding your mobile devices

166
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:09,760
to your social identities to try and

167
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,960
retain a little more visibility and

168
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:20,470
control so what to do and in most cases

169
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:23,720
as in life it becomes a question of

170
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,100
balance anybody recognize this image

171
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:33,620
here this happens to be it's an album

172
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,500
cover it happens to be the movie blues

173
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,740
from the early 70s I just happen to like

174
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,450
the philosophy of a question of balance

175
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:49,570
but it's definitely applicable here and

176
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,310
you know the thing about security is I

177
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:54,620
take a different approach I think to

178
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,930
most people I think of security first as

179
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:00,709
an enabler so you know really the

180
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:03,230
mission here is to enable business on a

181
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:06,230
secure and resilient foundation rather

182
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:09,589
than security being the moat or you know

183
00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:11,930
the protection I want to look at it as

184
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,880
something that you can use to launch

185
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:18,830
further beyond where you are today so

186
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:21,170
what are some examples of proactive

187
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:25,540
activities that can reduce smack risk so

188
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:29,660
in the social realm it comes down to

189
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,420
mostly identity i believe and so

190
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:36,740
identity assurance levels become a truss

191
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,930
point for utilizing this element and

192
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,820
some examples out there in the world

193
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,540
today are mystic which is a government

194
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,690
private sector avocent advocacy group

195
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:50,839
consortium that was formed in 2011 to

196
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:52,610
trust framework for Federation and an

197
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:55,640
ecosystem for IDs phyto is another

198
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,660
example fast identity online it's a 2013

199
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,610
industry consortium with a specification

200
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:04,520
for a full range of multi tech factor

201
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,310
authentication and I just read this week

202
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:12,140
that mystic joined the phyto alliance so

203
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,450
I thought that was a fairly significant

204
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:19,730
event in that particular realm in the

205
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:21,890
mobile realm as i mentioned device and

206
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:24,290
application management or effective

207
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,850
methods for increasing the value in

208
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,970
reducing the risk of mobile devices also

209
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:31,370
binding the mobile device to an assured

210
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:35,779
persona ID aka device pinning can take

211
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:37,100
trust to a higher level that's what i

212
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,630
was referring to in the previous slide

213
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:43,520
analytics again we talked about data

214
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,100
centric technologies and controls to

215
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,839
provide tools to minimize exposure and

216
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,339
uncertainty and damage examples are data

217
00:10:52,339 --> 00:10:55,640
classification leaked data DLP drm all

218
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:59,420
tied to a relevant access controls and

219
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,550
in the cloud space ox supplier

220
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,310
certification making sure

221
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,020
at the cloud vendors have a good program

222
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:08,920
in place and cloud government cloud

223
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,960
governance platform that's a name that I

224
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,300
coined myself remember that we'll be

225
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,590
talking about that in a minute or two

226
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:18,340
the cgp can provide the visibility and

227
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,320
data control over cloud service that the

228
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,150
vendor may not be able to provide

229
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:26,770
otherwise so let's do a quick shallow

230
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,570
dive into what cloud computing is

231
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,790
there's five essential characteristics

232
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:35,550
the first one is on demand service

233
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,140
second one is broad network access and

234
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,120
again anytime anywhere anyplace any

235
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:44,980
device resource pulling so resources are

236
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,410
not dedicated to any one particular task

237
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:51,310
they're used on demand as needed there's

238
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,400
rapid elects elasticity so 5 10 servers

239
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,380
and I have a big event I can ramp up to

240
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,380
100 servers very quickly by just pushing

241
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,360
a few configuration buttons and be on my

242
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,660
way and finally it's a measured service

243
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,270
so that i only pay what i use pay for

244
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:13,270
what i use so this is the nist model of

245
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:15,070
cloud computing and on the top layer

246
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,660
those are the five characteristics that

247
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,300
i just covered in the middle we have the

248
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:23,170
service delivery models so software as a

249
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:24,700
service platform as a service

250
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,520
infrastructure as a service and then at

251
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,050
the bottom we have deployment models

252
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:30,640
we've got public-private hybrid and

253
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,610
community so just for the sake of

254
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:36,010
argument what are the examples of

255
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:38,890
service delivery models Wells salesforce

256
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:41,530
com is the poster child for software as

257
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:45,040
a service amazon AWS is the platform as

258
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,589
a service that everybody knows about

259
00:12:46,589 --> 00:12:48,910
verizon terremark is the infrastructure

260
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:52,709
as a service and then if we look at the

261
00:12:52,709 --> 00:12:54,880
deployment models we got public that

262
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,360
would be AWS again as an example private

263
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,130
will be an enterprise cloud hyper would

264
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:03,339
be the combination of the AWS and the

265
00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:05,650
enterprise cloud and a community would

266
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:11,290
be customized public cloud subset okay

267
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,680
so this is a graph that to me is sort of

268
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,230
a spectrum as you go left to right here

269
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,600
and you know that the yellow represents

270
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,150
the subscribing 10 identity or the

271
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:25,030
enterprise and the blue is the vendor

272
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:28,120
the cloud service provider so on the

273
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,160
right hand side we see software as a

274
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,870
service and we see that the vendor has

275
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:35,440
complete control over everything and the

276
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,500
organization has very little control in

277
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,750
most cases so as you move across to the

278
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,940
left platform as a service you start to

279
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,360
share a little bit of responsibility and

280
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,830
visibility and control infrastructure

281
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:50,140
you give up a little you gag you gain a

282
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,940
little bit more when you get over to the

283
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,580
far right now you have you have complete

284
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,870
control because you're within the

285
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,390
enterprise environment the point here is

286
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:02,250
that the boundaries matter and where you

287
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,690
make the compromise to give up control

288
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:07,330
and visibility will matter in the end

289
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:11,350
and as my previous speaker as the

290
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,030
previous speaker mentioned in his talk

291
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:16,150
the cloud vendors usually will not take

292
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,910
responsibility for your data so when

293
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,730
you're over on the far right-hand side

294
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:23,320
it's up to you to take action that

295
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,400
they're not going to so just for

296
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,320
industry trends the drumbeat of cloud

297
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,850
computing just keeps getting stronger

298
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:33,220
and here's a graph that's a little bit

299
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,070
dated but it's still trending true IT

300
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:38,230
spending on cloud is going to triple

301
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:42,730
between 2011 and 2017 so it's really an

302
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:46,450
unstoppable force so cloud governance /

303
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,370
platform I talked about this a little

304
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:49,780
bit earlier I'm going to deep dive into

305
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,880
it a little further now a cloud

306
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:56,770
governments platform is a tool that you

307
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,690
can leverage from a third party vendor

308
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:02,290
that would sit in between your

309
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:07,090
application in the cloud and your users

310
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:09,220
it could either be on premise or in the

311
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:12,240
cloud itself and it gives you control

312
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,850
analysis and discovery over the usual

313
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:18,520
suspects suspects which are the items

314
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,010
over in the right hand cloud there with

315
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:24,790
box and office 365 and Salesforce and so

316
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:28,510
on so whether your users are at home in

317
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,950
your enterprise mo

318
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:33,430
whatever this platform is going to give

319
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,350
you visibility that you didn't have

320
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:38,560
otherwise mobile users even if they

321
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,690
don't come through your enterprise still

322
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,000
can have you can still have visibility

323
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,720
and control over their activities and

324
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,660
again Gardner has another term for this

325
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,550
they call it a cloud access security

326
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,190
book a little too wordy for me but there

327
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:57,640
you go so the part about the mobile user

328
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,160
that's pretty significant because

329
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,340
otherwise your mobile users running

330
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:05,560
box.com app on their on their smartphone

331
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,600
you lose complete visibility without a

332
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,510
cloud governments platform whether you

333
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,820
have tools in your enterprise it's it's

334
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:17,980
pretty much gone out the door so let's

335
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,530
talk about two use cases for cloud data

336
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:23,140
control and visibility strategic

337
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:26,050
initiatives cloud governance platform

338
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:28,090
for box calm and cloud governance

339
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:32,770
platform for salesforce com so in in an

340
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:35,020
enterprise setting for box typically

341
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:38,110
what happens is you may invoke sam'l

342
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:41,650
assertion a single sign-on to box from

343
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,900
your enterprise and you basically tell

344
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,550
your users okay there it is go ahead and

345
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:48,760
use box and for me the real value add in

346
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,680
boxes collaboration the fact that you

347
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,230
can just drop files in in the Box cloud

348
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:55,510
is okay but the fact that you can

349
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,040
collaborate those files with other

350
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,320
people especially third parties outside

351
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,060
of your organization is really where the

352
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,940
value is well without a cloud governance

353
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,410
platform you really don't know much

354
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:07,030
about what's going on out there in the

355
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:10,630
Box cloud but with a cloud governance

356
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:13,270
platform here's an example of 12 file

357
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:15,310
vents that you will have real-time

358
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,890
monitoring and logging of all these

359
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:20,500
activities that occur and what's really

360
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,650
most important here for me are these two

361
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:25,900
in the right hand column share and

362
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,810
invite collaborator so now you have more

363
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:31,150
visibility about what's actually going

364
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:35,260
on so you can tell your users okay we're

365
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,990
going to allow you to share regulated

366
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,640
data with third parties but owning with

367
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,160
the parties that we have quality-assured

368
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,570
through our own

369
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,309
kind of governance function to make sure

370
00:17:45,309 --> 00:17:47,470
that they're HIPAA compliant or PCI

371
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,690
compliant or whatever if you don't do

372
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:50,919
that we're going to know about it we're

373
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:52,720
going to get alerts we're going to take

374
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,809
action on those things so this

375
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:58,269
particular kind of platform can actually

376
00:17:58,269 --> 00:18:00,490
either be in line or it can be offline

377
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:02,470
meaning that it's it's off to the side

378
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:05,200
and through an API it's looking at the

379
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,750
box file activities without even being

380
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,899
in line with the user to give you back

381
00:18:10,899 --> 00:18:14,399
that control and visibility and feedback

382
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:17,169
so what additional features can i

383
00:18:17,169 --> 00:18:23,620
leverage with those 12 functions I can

384
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,960
do policy-based pre cloud storage

385
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,600
encryption if I like so that I don't

386
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,389
have to trust box calm to handle my data

387
00:18:31,389 --> 00:18:32,919
any particular way because I'm

388
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:38,289
encrypting it myself I can invoke DLP

389
00:18:38,289 --> 00:18:40,629
independent of the cloud service and I

390
00:18:40,629 --> 00:18:42,399
can optionally integrate it with my own

391
00:18:42,399 --> 00:18:47,070
existing enterprise DLP policy engines I

392
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:51,309
can retain enterprise based granule or

393
00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:53,830
access controls completely independent

394
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:56,070
of what the cloud vendor provides and

395
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:59,350
again a big win here is the mobile

396
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:02,019
device coverage for BYOD and extra

397
00:19:02,019 --> 00:19:04,720
enterprise source devices as well so

398
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,730
somebody fires up the browser on their

399
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,860
xbox then they go to box they have

400
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,019
credentials to get in you're still be it

401
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:12,759
you're still being able to monitor what

402
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:14,860
they're doing through that kind of a

403
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,210
session even though they're not on your

404
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:17,350
enterprises they're not even on a

405
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:21,789
sanctioned piece of equipment so what

406
00:19:21,789 --> 00:19:23,620
features can we leverage in order to

407
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,470
support sharing of pH I and PII

408
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:33,190
regulated data with third parties we can

409
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:35,799
have live audit log and event access

410
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:41,409
monitoring we can in real time out DLP

411
00:19:41,409 --> 00:19:43,029
anomaly detection and instant

412
00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:46,600
notification again we can have coverage

413
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,250
for native mobile in order to end or

414
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,279
desktop clients and we can also do

415
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:52,990
something interesting like a scheduled

416
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:55,210
scan for discovering interesting content

417
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:57,340
so even if you put up a policy

418
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,020
it says yours here's the rules of

419
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,250
engagement here's the things you're

420
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,370
allowed to do even if you're not looking

421
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,350
for specific things in those policies

422
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:09,670
you can define regex queries and other

423
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:14,080
kinds of unstructured data in inquiries

424
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,260
into the data in the entire store to

425
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,850
understand what other kinds of

426
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,590
activities are going on within that

427
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:25,090
environment so here's an example of a

428
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:28,960
log file from the DLP engine that

429
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,190
occurred in box and in the third column

430
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,290
from the right we see the anomaly value

431
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:36,940
so we have a couple credit cards some

432
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,820
social security numbers a HIPAA member

433
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,670
ID and we we will immediately see the

434
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,290
user that was involved in that

435
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:47,680
particular event some other attributes

436
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,710
time and date stamp that occurred this

437
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:53,920
is our actionable information if there's

438
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,840
there's a policy violation for example

439
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,570
okay moving on to Salesforce claw

440
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:03,610
governance platform here's the model for

441
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:06,880
Salesforce think that's key to this

442
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,540
particular architecture is the fact that

443
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:13,570
it is specifically in line so we're

444
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,610
doing a little DNS manipulation here

445
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:19,540
we're doing CRM ABC com on the

446
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,070
right-hand side on the left hand side

447
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:23,590
we're actually going to ABC dot cells

448
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:28,210
for comm the real URL but more to the

449
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:31,510
point of the the encryption that is

450
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:35,400
being invoked within the cloud vendor

451
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,400
the keys the session Keys the store for

452
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,070
those keys is handling is being handled

453
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:44,650
on the enterprise over there on the on

454
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,420
the right hand side the vault key server

455
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:49,870
is on-premise it could be any particular

456
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,700
kind of key server doesn't have to come

457
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,770
from the cloud governance platform

458
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:57,460
vendor through the km IP protocol key

459
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:00,670
management interoperability protocol the

460
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:02,560
premise key agent can query the key

461
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,080
server for session Keys push them out to

462
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,210
the cloud and even the cloud vendor is

463
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:10,330
not really going to have a knowledge of

464
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:13,269
those keys and how they're derived so

465
00:22:13,269 --> 00:22:15,250
now you still maintain control of that

466
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,429
data and all the data to get that gets

467
00:22:18,429 --> 00:22:21,399
stored in Salesforce is still under your

468
00:22:21,399 --> 00:22:26,620
domain and control so in this particular

469
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:30,730
case we have a transparent in line proxy

470
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:33,899
with an API interface to salesforce com

471
00:22:33,899 --> 00:22:36,789
providing field level encryption and dlp

472
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:38,799
scanning according to your enterprise

473
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:44,919
policies this slide here is actually a

474
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:46,990
little bit overlapping with the previous

475
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:50,649
discussion the graph on the on the upper

476
00:22:50,649 --> 00:22:54,360
half if you go across the horizontal

477
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,340
axis you're looking at preserving

478
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,340
functionality in your encryption

479
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:02,529
selection type if you go across the

480
00:23:02,529 --> 00:23:05,139
vertical axis you're talking about the

481
00:23:05,139 --> 00:23:07,299
encryption strength so we got seven

482
00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:09,220
different kinds of encryption techniques

483
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,860
here to be able to protect your data in

484
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,399
order to strike a balance between

485
00:23:14,399 --> 00:23:17,380
preserving functionality that data such

486
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,269
as searching and indexing those kinds of

487
00:23:19,269 --> 00:23:21,850
things and the encryption strength that

488
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:26,679
you would be able to affect and then the

489
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:28,600
bottom half are basically some academic

490
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,600
papers probably from the same realm as

491
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,149
the previous speaker and the heavy matha

492
00:23:34,149 --> 00:23:38,110
cos into those those theories that go

493
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:40,870
into those papers but the product of

494
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:43,330
that research are these seven different

495
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:48,399
encryption types so this particular

496
00:23:48,399 --> 00:23:50,350
slide here is a screen grab from a tool

497
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:53,980
that you might use to configure the

498
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,919
encryption types for your salesforce.com

499
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,870
application it's a little fuzzy but you

500
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:02,500
know the first column represents the

501
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,840
name of the field the second column is

502
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,210
the API name so every time that that

503
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:09,639
particular field is in a particular

504
00:24:09,639 --> 00:24:12,639
application or record you're identifying

505
00:24:12,639 --> 00:24:14,529
it by the API name rather than just the

506
00:24:14,529 --> 00:24:17,080
field name the third column represents

507
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,270
the occurrences of that API within the

508
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:22,059
application and then the fourth column

509
00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:24,100
represents the type of encryption

510
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,919
of those seven types that you want to

511
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:29,830
apply to that particular piece of data

512
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,960
in order to strike that balance again

513
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,240
between functionality and encryption

514
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:40,690
strengths so final word cloud computing

515
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:44,200
is just going to keep exploding it's

516
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,539
something that you really can't push off

517
00:24:46,539 --> 00:24:47,980
to the side it's going to be there it's

518
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,299
going to come at you from every which

519
00:24:49,299 --> 00:24:55,168
way and that's all I have any questions

520
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:08,060
i blinded them with science
