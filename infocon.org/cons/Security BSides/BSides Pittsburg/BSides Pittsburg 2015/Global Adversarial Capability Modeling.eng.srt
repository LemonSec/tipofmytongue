1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
spring glow and forever serial

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:13,049
capability model not easy tom I should

3
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:15,450
also probably avoid putting 15 syllable

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,789
words my title scary thing could have

5
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:20,390
probably unwise

6
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:25,060
this presentation I actually gave this

7
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,530
week's are going to go at the end of May

8
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,410
in Barcelona at the net fishing working

9
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:34,010
group conference so there is paper that

10
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:35,840
goes is this which I wanted to go to

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,030
abstract away harm but if you do like to

12
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,870
reap in verses that I am a big fan of

13
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,100
making what you're doing transparent and

14
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,010
clear available so with open for scope

15
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:48,920
the first presentation is great this is

16
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,000
not code right so this is a way to make

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,980
sure that we think about what's going to

18
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:59,379
happen do risky sentences works

19
00:00:59,379 --> 00:01:02,420
basically this is Intel stuff and so

20
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,680
there's not open source code for this

21
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,120
because it's pretty good software for

22
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,909
your brain so the English is the open

23
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:12,110
source code you'll probably have this

24
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:14,360
memorized video of the day so we had to

25
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,610
close up the legal stuff at the end so I

26
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,140
hope you're all sleepy let's see it

27
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,850
again detective yeah so that's actually

28
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:21,770
just a that's the prelim for the test

29
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:25,000
that how it's going to give you

30
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,930
so I'm coming at this from the defense

31
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:34,690
on up it's like I certain more and the

32
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,480
goal of Intel o is to let you do

33
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:41,020
something intelligent what you do

34
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,039
anything useful

35
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:47,220
this basically means that we need to

36
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,120
predict how the world is gonna be you're

37
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,200
going to do something about it you need

38
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,390
to know how the work was going to be is

39
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,200
that what you want to change

40
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,310
so fancy words we're going to predict

41
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,260
the future state of the world right now

42
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,800
that's sort of hard

43
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,720
I can anyone tell me what the biggest

44
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,009
attack on the internet is going to be in

45
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:14,530
six months usually enough can you tell

46
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:18,310
me if there's going to be a way to break

47
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:23,470
into windows a box in six months yes

48
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,650
yeah there's totally gonna be one I

49
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:29,440
don't know what it is right now but it's

50
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,320
going to be there can you tell me if

51
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,880
there's a way to break into the water

52
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,590
system that controls the topwater DX

53
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:38,880
into this building in six months

54
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:43,000
maybe we don't know as well right so

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,500
what I'm trying to answer with this work

56
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,920
is we sort of all know that windows much

57
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,460
people are going for you we don't have

58
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,170
as good of an intuition about some of

59
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,430
these other systems that are coming

60
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,520
online so what I'm trying to do here is

61
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,080
take the lessons that we all sort of

62
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,240
know from how windows broken and how

63
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,220
people move through the phases of the

64
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,209
break windows and applying that to

65
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:10,620
figuring out how they're going to break

66
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,680
all these other systems that are right

67
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,540
it's of that way i can predict lips and

68
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,220
be like in three years instead of in two

69
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,459
months because if i could predict with

70
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:22,050
something to be like for you i might be

71
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,910
able to actually plan for it but if i

72
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,020
don't know what something is going to do

73
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,459
two months out that is less than

74
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:28,350
everyone's acquisition cycle and

75
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,600
everyone's hi ring cycle you can't get

76
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,070
some of the rage are into money how are

77
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,550
you applying for four months out rightly

78
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,630
three years whatever able to do

79
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,959
something

80
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:43,980
plus I said take a dicks quickly and the

81
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,870
general new tech creates these weird

82
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,550
complicated interactions that are hard

83
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:51,420
to predict but adversaries are using

84
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,340
tech as a tool to depends so really

85
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,310
there ends are we can probably get a

86
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,470
better idea of what type of means is if

87
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,670
the tech is that we going to end open

88
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,709
source and they want to get into your

89
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:03,989
castle then they can get it they'll get

90
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:06,470
in your castle

91
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,810
the other thing that we sort of have to

92
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:14,220
watch out for so a little bit of a stray

93
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,100
byzantine history comes into the whole i

94
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,810
think the walls of Constantinople were

95
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,540
not reduced for 1400 years then even

96
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,960
though it happened in 1450 they invented

97
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,620
cannons

98
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,039
and Turkish ever commissioned to 28 slip

99
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:35,039
on the cannon built a road to wheel it

100
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:37,319
comes editable and shot at the walls for

101
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,919
26 days

102
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,340
an impassible didn't work so well

103
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,460
anymore

104
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,590
we ought to be able to pretty offensive

105
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:49,820
things because now those things happen

106
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,630
every six months

107
00:04:54,529 --> 00:04:57,699
so there's a bunch of things that model

108
00:04:57,699 --> 00:05:00,289
attacks right so we have the kill chain

109
00:05:00,289 --> 00:05:02,209
if you want to do attribution you can do

110
00:05:02,209 --> 00:05:03,439
it without me model would chasing the

111
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:04,759
scraps that killed you up and helps you

112
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:07,359
think about a couple of different tasks

113
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:09,589
we have this way good way to think of an

114
00:05:09,589 --> 00:05:12,199
adversary objectives for for campaigns

115
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:15,199
from even 98 right the common language

116
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,749
for computer security instances from my

117
00:05:17,749 --> 00:05:21,219
1088 long Savin a guy from Cynthia that

118
00:05:21,219 --> 00:05:23,629
but none of them really helped me

119
00:05:23,629 --> 00:05:25,669
predict the next attack they just let me

120
00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:29,539
figure out what happened yesterday so I

121
00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:31,279
would figure out how to talk about

122
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:35,149
tomorrow not yesterday the thing that

123
00:05:35,149 --> 00:05:37,609
I've found is difficult some of you may

124
00:05:37,609 --> 00:05:39,739
have noticed this you don't always know

125
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:42,669
your cottage on you

126
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:46,100
I felt this is very hard for me worth

127
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,900
analysts so really thinking about

128
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,960
tell me who did it it's the internet

129
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,360
someone on the internet tell me who did

130
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,340
it are you that may be the name of the

131
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,639
place I gotta go get a guy but nah they

132
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,860
were like six proxies that you just told

133
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,780
you get into the proxy Network they're

134
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,030
all compromised machines could be

135
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:09,169
anywhere now how're you did okay look

136
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:13,199
the internet not a physical network but

137
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,970
what are you talking about what our

138
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:21,810
computers I don't care who it is the

139
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,310
thing about the unit i did everyone is

140
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,940
tending to you

141
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,960
there is no sad to you who did a risk

142
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,590
assessment of the electric grid they are

143
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,690
all our transformers to get the power to

144
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:37,090
fulfill it turns out that we will take

145
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:40,480
them anymore and you take them out of

146
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,740
the sniper rifle because there's in the

147
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,410
middle of the woods they're very

148
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:45,550
concerned about this for a while until

149
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:46,810
they realize that no one goes in the

150
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:47,890
middle of the woods with a sniper rifle

151
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,690
and shoots the transform I soon catch

152
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:52,690
them as you eat physical access to the

153
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:57,280
thing to go to destroy that's not true

154
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,170
Alina everyone has physical access to

155
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,420
everything if that's what being on the

156
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:05,320
inter hands so the adversaries only need

157
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,540
the capability of the intense to get

158
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:12,070
stuff they don't need physical access so

159
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,690
they don't need physical access I only

160
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,340
need to model their capability and then

161
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,360
you need to figure out if they want to

162
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,850
get to you and that's how you figure out

163
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:21,180
having fun

164
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:28,790
so these are all fancy words to get me

165
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,680
except into an academic conference what

166
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,990
this means is that i have the vin turned

167
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,150
read everything there was about XP and i

168
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,800
also synthesized you know the facts that

169
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,970
I've been working on this for five years

170
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,250
like oh XPS been broken for a while

171
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:51,320
I love this where I'm like oh man this

172
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,420
sort of it's like the same thing that

173
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:56,570
happened to the other windows 95 this is

174
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,370
sort of the same thing that you know for

175
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,410
having the Android and like windows

176
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:03,260
seven turns up still broken no hey SLRs

177
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,750
nice alright like cuz they started to

178
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,630
get pass a SLR basically what 36 months

179
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:12,740
ever came out so

180
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,960
after you see the same pattern the same

181
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,430
process six or ten times like maybe

182
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,660
maybe I can figure out what the pattern

183
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,630
is if I could figure out the pattern I

184
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,039
can predict the future states of the

185
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,949
world and get people to pay him money so

186
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:30,919
what we did is I did this loop came up

187
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:32,450
with a came up with a stripped away I

188
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,580
modeled I chose it too much be one sir

189
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,320
they went now that's them do this this

190
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,979
in this better oh yeah that's true where

191
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:41,599
did it yeah and it showed it to some

192
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,969
more people anyway this is better but

193
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:47,060
these days ok and so then I presented it

194
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,300
in early I don't see anything

195
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,700
particularly wrong I'm sure there's

196
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,610
something so I'm sure that there's

197
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:57,950
something else wrong with this this is

198
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:00,380
why I tell it to more people so that one

199
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,850
of you can come up afterwards hopefully

200
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,680
quietly about asked in part of everyone

201
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,529
tell me stupid better but if you insist

202
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:07,910
on embarrassing me to make sure the

203
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,470
point gets across tell if everyone

204
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,800
that's fine

205
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:16,030
so I'd really didn't have to focus said

206
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:18,070
that already right can't find it anyway

207
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:22,300
so just don't worry but I want to know

208
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,070
how good all the adversaries in the

209
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:27,240
whole world aren't attacking this thing

210
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:33,070
we've done this for four things and one

211
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,120
of the things is actually kind of

212
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,970
attacking the control so I think that I

213
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,680
have your series have a capability to

214
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,620
compromise a particular system that's

215
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,880
going to be different than administering

216
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,680
upon its not the same skill set to

217
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,870
administer a hundred million that would

218
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,090
not that as it is to compromise 100 more

219
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:56,350
emissions those are Jim and also some of

220
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,850
them feed into each other okay so you

221
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,230
don't have to compromise 100 million

222
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,790
machines of the same operating system

223
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:04,060
but they might only controls so we're

224
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,350
going to model those things differently

225
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,980
and then what I haven't done yet is

226
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,240
figured out how those things all sort of

227
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,740
mesh together but anything you can sort

228
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,290
of see it from where I am that you know

229
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:16,720
if there's a fire role there's the

230
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,100
capability to get past the firewall

231
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,690
and then there's the windows machine

232
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,370
once they get past the firewall they

233
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:23,690
have their capability of getting in

234
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,670
subway this machine I know once a

235
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,600
compromise that they have their

236
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,190
capability to control them except those

237
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:30,200
are three capabilities they can do all

238
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,990
those things get in your system you guys

239
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:35,420
don't know that that's not hard the

240
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,190
thing is how many people have that

241
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:39,560
capability right now so the model is how

242
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,080
many people have that capability how

243
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,200
many people have it determines how much

244
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,900
it costs if they capability to

245
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,700
compromise with those is open source

246
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,370
it's free and we do it you have to spend

247
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:53,570
a lot of money to stop it from happening

248
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,210
is every possibly on your system even

249
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:58,340
the electricity then running to mine

250
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:02,720
bitcoins income after that's a little

251
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,830
bit different than if you a lot of

252
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,720
clothes out system that no one really

253
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,670
knows about you have just said less on

254
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,080
it because there are fewer people with a

255
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:14,240
capability to have them I thought so

256
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,760
one of the things we were into I know

257
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,980
that definitions is ever most favorite

258
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,620
thing but we're like 10 threes I think

259
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,000
that everyone at least like perfectly

260
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,070
awake right now just a bunch of tired of

261
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:28,339
this yet there's also all 1030 good send

262
00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:29,660
me up I don't know how we got a sunny

263
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:32,600
day finally writing ad copy so put your

264
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,120
one slide a very pens definition may be

265
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,640
tired for that of the day make sure that

266
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,899
no one else can do anything useful so

267
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:44,709
the capability is having the things and

268
00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:48,589
knowing how but knowing how is usually

269
00:11:48,589 --> 00:11:50,630
on the internet or high p or paper

270
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,610
towards in hacker for or where is this

271
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:54,110
that you have to buy it is it a hundred

272
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:56,089
dollars thousand dollars of million

273
00:11:56,089 --> 00:12:00,740
dollars a software system as i live in

274
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,080
to in a set of software instructions

275
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,180
that execute in the same environment and

276
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:09,290
run to the same set of permissions so is

277
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,060
anyone ever tried to remove internet

278
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,529
explorer from windows

279
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:16,170
yeah does anyone then run up against the

280
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,459
little website it says by the way you

281
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:18,749
can do this because we build it into the

282
00:12:18,749 --> 00:12:23,310
files explorer and we hate you you run

283
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:26,189
up to that real quick so the thing is if

284
00:12:26,189 --> 00:12:28,110
you compromise the Internet Explorer you

285
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:30,959
compromise the windows kernel at least

286
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,870
an XD they tried to make it off a user

287
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:38,819
I'm not sure if that means that Internet

288
00:12:38,819 --> 00:12:40,139
Explorer the thing that goes and fetches

289
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:42,269
random unknown web pages it is execute

290
00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:44,309
them is the same software system as the

291
00:12:44,309 --> 00:12:47,399
window sir this is the reason why we

292
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:50,670
have some problem witness this also

293
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:53,069
means if I model Android or modeled

294
00:12:53,069 --> 00:12:56,069
livings Firefox is one software system

295
00:12:56,069 --> 00:12:57,839
the linux kernel is a different software

296
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,100
system those are different but for

297
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,749
Windows is the same because you can't

298
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:07,559
take it for now and so we got into some

299
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:09,660
weird space where I thought that I was

300
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,160
modeling the Android colonel

301
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,649
capabilities but it was actually

302
00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:15,720
modeling the Android user space because

303
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,949
those are actually different and that's

304
00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:19,470
when I realized windows is terribly

305
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:23,189
awfully useless but that's why this is

306
00:13:23,189 --> 00:13:24,990
important

307
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:27,520
so what we did is we organized this in

308
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,370
two phases and it's pretty picture of

309
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:33,480
the moon two phases of it's like a puppy

310
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,770
but it's not actually thought of having

311
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:38,200
to be funnier

312
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,260
so we have discovery validation

313
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,300
escalation the Aequitas ation and

314
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,140
ubiquity right age start with discovery

315
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:50,800
can you go through you don't really have

316
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:56,080
to see validation set of know that

317
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,790
you're going to move into escalation

318
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:01,090
they pretty much go in order but there's

319
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,200
a couple of things that make this hard

320
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,380
one is

321
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,820
that some of these things are kept

322
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,900
secret so we did the xb1 we got a report

323
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:20,020
from 2010 but the military had problems

324
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,940
with the Chinese breaking into their XP

325
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:27,160
systems in two thousand or so we didn't

326
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,040
know until seven years later that

327
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,930
validation of espionage would happen for

328
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:35,980
XD so sometimes you don't know that one

329
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,750
of these symptoms has been observed

330
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,750
until way later but we know that that's

331
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,160
going to happen because these things are

332
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,460
secrets right of course B marker but so

333
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,870
that's why we looked at XP to be much

334
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,540
later so one reason you might see things

335
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,850
moving faster than you think is that one

336
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,200
of the other things has actually

337
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,160
happened and adjust have been reporting

338
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,200
the other reason is that if people know

339
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,700
that they can make money and do

340
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,830
espionage on the thing they might go on

341
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:07,330
to creating well hunted or they might be

342
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:08,620
well haunted or high factors in the

343
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:11,380
space right before you see people

344
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:14,400
actually doing some sort of battle sir

345
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,180
so

346
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,690
you're gonna have to see at least one I

347
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:23,290
proposed might be Robert has been proven

348
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,460
wrong yet so that's what we're going to

349
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:27,910
go on his science that if you see one of

350
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,460
these symptoms that phase has started

351
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:34,209
and then you might start to see another

352
00:15:34,209 --> 00:15:36,760
symptom from the next phase but you

353
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,910
won't see anything from you want skipper

354
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:42,220
face but you'll see one symptom and if

355
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,750
you might you can extend them and then

356
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:47,140
we might go back and complete the prior

357
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,360
phase they call a phase completed if

358
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,180
you've seen all of the symptoms and part

359
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,890
of the predictive power comes it is if

360
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:57,070
you see all three of disruption ability

361
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,899
monetary gain and nesting on being

362
00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:02,620
validated or proved by doing some sort

363
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,910
of compromise then we're going to move

364
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:07,660
into escalation soup because all of

365
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,730
those things

366
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:13,600
so I have four case studies depending on

367
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,399
how much you all want to see them I have

368
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:17,440
three of them in backup slides that I

369
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,850
could definitely go over the windows 1

370
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,709
i'll take some questions and then if i

371
00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:25,360
still have time to kill Abigail so we

372
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,040
meet these fancy graphics is everyone

373
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,839
money graphics especially higher-ups who

374
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:31,810
don't really get paid don't really want

375
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:34,690
to the higher-ups need to get the

376
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,190
summary of the stuff the hard work that

377
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:39,040
we've done we need to obviously happened

378
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,290
in a one-page graphic usually a pass but

379
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:42,910
I can't bring myself to make a map of

380
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,940
the internet it's not a physical system

381
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:49,810
and I hate that but so the darker the

382
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:54,070
box is the more infinity for giggles we

383
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:56,829
also charted the market share XD across

384
00:16:56,829 --> 00:16:59,320
the bottom I have no idea of this

385
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,990
actually correlates but it looks like

386
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:04,270
obviously if something is more popular

387
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,160
it's likely for people to move against

388
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,760
it quickly I know that all those things

389
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,699
are very tight but basically as soon as

390
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,349
whether they feed him out you had the

391
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:17,579
first bowl in the first ex boy

392
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:24,390
which was a upnp exploit you also

393
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,849
actually have the first just proof comes

394
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:30,510
up a work and the counter work later

395
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:34,170
then see so Mike the end of 2002

396
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:36,360
discovery is done because windows

397
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,100
actually sort of been around since how

398
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,720
you Clive so the next thing comes up

399
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,190
through that link 2002 we've already

400
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,080
pretty well hashed out those were code

401
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:49,310
reuse problems you see proof of funny

402
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:52,140
pretty quick proof of espionage pretty

403
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:56,820
quick so shadow crew stuff money starts

404
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,520
to happen and then you see blaster and

405
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,200
so this is the space where like everyone

406
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,790
was crying all the time is the work

407
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,140
we're just spreading through the whole

408
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,740
ecosystem

409
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,590
and so that's proof of disruption

410
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,490
because when the internet goes down

411
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:13,330
that's disrupted by infecting windows so

412
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:14,890
that means that if you know that you can

413
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:16,420
destroy something you have some power

414
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:22,080
over right like dude close enough

415
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,399
hot guys

416
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,990
and so if you have the ability to

417
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:32,230
destroy or cause hard with windows XP

418
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:34,600
then you have people did USB knowledge

419
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,480
like I spin we get the back dated

420
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,340
reports about the Espionage in the

421
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:42,460
military we have Russian criminal gangs

422
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,850
using it to seal financial credentials

423
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:50,340
all by mid 2003

424
00:18:51,779 --> 00:18:53,729
and then you basically get remotely

425
00:18:53,729 --> 00:18:56,249
controlled zombie king all the stuff go

426
00:18:56,249 --> 00:18:58,469
through by the end of two thousand seven

427
00:18:58,469 --> 00:19:00,719
books sort of bad but if anyone was in

428
00:19:00,719 --> 00:19:01,859
this industry two thousand seven

429
00:19:01,859 --> 00:19:04,169
protecting XP machines really ok this is

430
00:19:04,169 --> 00:19:06,719
ok but like not really happy about this

431
00:19:06,719 --> 00:19:08,909
alright but people start paying penchant

432
00:19:08,909 --> 00:19:10,889
for system dude this is when people

433
00:19:10,889 --> 00:19:12,690
realize they like that rooms on the neck

434
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,159
steam machine and everything is sort of

435
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:16,139
actually broken but it's not really

436
00:19:16,139 --> 00:19:18,450
broken in to get to the last half of the

437
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:21,090
life cycle where you get Zeus beating

438
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:23,219
for sale for six hundred dollars to

439
00:19:23,219 --> 00:19:24,929
anyone with a stolen credit card little

440
00:19:24,929 --> 00:19:27,929
past except the fellows and then it goes

441
00:19:27,929 --> 00:19:31,789
down to 60 and then it gets open source

442
00:19:31,789 --> 00:19:34,259
right and then metasploit is open source

443
00:19:34,259 --> 00:19:37,109
and then metasploit is updated

444
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:39,719
continually with open source updates for

445
00:19:39,719 --> 00:19:43,009
XP detroit's which is at the top there

446
00:19:43,009 --> 00:19:48,649
and the one of the end is end of life

447
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:51,330
and so when we have that whole stack

448
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:56,040
filled up we have free control free

449
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:00,110
exploit no more updates

450
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:03,040
how expensive is it

451
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,840
to compromise the windows XP machine

452
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,940
right now rightly laptop I think it's

453
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,590
what 40 seconds if it's connected to the

454
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:11,620
NMM unprotected that might be it was

455
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,150
five minutes like two years ago thing

456
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:15,190
has gone down because they'll steal the

457
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,750
electricity lab it's cheap enough that

458
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,840
they'll steal the electricity um if you

459
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:24,330
go back right when you have just

460
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,530
military-grade security being

461
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:29,860
compromised there's not just like people

462
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,750
in someone's basement in 2003

463
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,610
compromising Steve machines in quite the

464
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:38,500
same way wait they might be putting in

465
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,330
a hundred hours to do with themselves

466
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:41,800
and just not getting paid for it for

467
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,690
some reason because they like it but

468
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,400
it's a hundred hours of the work now

469
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,070
it's five seconds where the work is

470
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,540
however fast your internet connection is

471
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:55,180
to download the zoo spots right and so

472
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,190
that changes how much you have to spend

473
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:58,600
to defend it it also changes how much

474
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,460
you have to spend you attack it right

475
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:06,010
these are the same so I put forth that

476
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:07,660
we should follow this adversarial

477
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:12,460
capability is going in stages I think

478
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:15,730
that we have a reasonable reason to

479
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:18,130
think this I think that it helps us

480
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:19,960
figure out a future threat light table a

481
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,330
little bit more accurately my estimate

482
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:24,850
is maybe that it stretches us to 18

483
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,160
months to three years out instead of six

484
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,490
months out or something like that

485
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:31,540
because I think that it helps us make

486
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:35,440
predictions now I can keep going but I

487
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,030
want to give you guys the opportunity to

488
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:40,360
ask any questions or comments yeah word

489
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:46,139
flicka's so I haven't done

490
00:21:46,399 --> 00:21:49,409
so I haven't done a rigorous analysis of

491
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:53,009
that but there's definitely windows 7

492
00:21:53,009 --> 00:21:59,059
malware right is it open source yet

493
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:02,980
I don't actually know games are actually

494
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,850
housing

495
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:07,070
does anyone know there's a couple of

496
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,570
other things a bit open source lately I

497
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:09,890
don't know if Zeus has within seven

498
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,810
plugins the problem with windows is that

499
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:15,170
there's code reuse so some of the XP my

500
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:18,200
notes still apply the real thing that I

501
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,930
think so this comes into the definition

502
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:22,850
of software system many treaties I think

503
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:24,200
that the new thing for seven and eight

504
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,020
is that they turned on deaf ASL are by

505
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:32,060
default and that is a different software

506
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:35,000
system basically because that gets in

507
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,550
between the user space and doing

508
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,770
whatever you want and so I think it

509
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:41,540
would be better not to say what's the

510
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,670
capability against seven but what's the

511
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:45,890
capability ASL aren't deaf since those

512
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:47,930
get turned on much more easily instead

513
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:53,470
of me and I know that there are

514
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:56,270
definitely proven attacks against those

515
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:59,750
fences but if you don't have a SLR indep

516
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,610
running like I think that you're

517
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:03,890
basically the same boat is XP more or

518
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:07,150
less except for the you get patches

519
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:12,690
does anyone disagree with me on that

520
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:14,430
we just heard how easy it is to break

521
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:16,200
into the hole wit of the system so i'm

522
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,820
going to feel too unjustified time

523
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:24,649
I don't disagree i have a question

524
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:29,830
as somebody who would want to use the

525
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:34,030
model and its predictive power what I

526
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:38,800
don't see in the model is how the attack

527
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,020
focus changes over time well so for

528
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,300
example if you're a government

529
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,990
organization and you're in the early

530
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:48,970
stage of the month you're a victim in

531
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,790
the early stage of model you have two

532
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,920
things that I don't think the model of

533
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,770
dress is one is you're likely not to

534
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,900
share that information widely so

535
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:02,350
knowledge of the exploit and capability

536
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:07,000
remains very limited and as that

537
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,820
knowledge spread through escalation and

538
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:14,260
ultimately G Vic whaty the targets of

539
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:17,830
the attacks shift as well so going back

540
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:20,290
to the governmental organization if

541
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:22,090
you're somebody responsible for

542
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:23,230
protecting against that particular

543
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:25,360
capability or mitigating up different

544
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,870
capability

545
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,460
there needs to be something saying how

546
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:33,250
worried that person needs to be about

547
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:35,830
the future attacks involving that

548
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:38,020
capability because it seems based on the

549
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,960
model that they quickly shifts away from

550
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,640
the people who have the early knowledge

551
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,520
to the lower hanging proved that far

552
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:50,740
more publicly accessible try to

553
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:54,040
summarize this is basically I don't

554
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:58,530
handle distribution or extent of damage

555
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:02,290
by giving the particular item broken

556
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:04,420
because I don't talk about how widely

557
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:07,360
distributed the software system is we

558
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,070
all sort of talk about whatever you

559
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:11,170
would actually apply pressure to do

560
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:13,150
something useful especially if you're

561
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:16,179
the person designing the system I think

562
00:25:16,179 --> 00:25:18,520
that it's pretty clear from this that

563
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,440
once you hit escalation you're going to

564
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,390
run away to ubiquitin it's too late

565
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,970
right so that means that if you didn't

566
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:27,970
itself design a software system you need

567
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:31,620
to basically not have it be targetable

568
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:35,710
because once you get proof of money or

569
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:38,410
proof of destruction ability it'll

570
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:40,660
probably run away into escalation you

571
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:43,510
can try to tamp that down by keeping it

572
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:46,190
by keeping a hold on that

573
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:47,659
but really means that if you don't

574
00:25:47,659 --> 00:25:49,370
prevent the actors from dating the

575
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:51,889
capability at a very early stage which

576
00:25:51,889 --> 00:25:54,860
is an asymmetric cost right won't be

577
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,659
able to get a whole lot once it gets

578
00:25:56,659 --> 00:25:59,539
away from you so I think that that's the

579
00:25:59,539 --> 00:26:04,159
recommendation that's not very nice for

580
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,740
people to hear with a a lot of systems

581
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,080
because it basically breaks down to the

582
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:14,299
build security in principle right it I

583
00:26:14,299 --> 00:26:16,279
could retrain late what I said as the

584
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:18,259
security stuff has to be building from

585
00:26:18,259 --> 00:26:19,519
the beginnings of the doesn't get

586
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:20,899
targetable so that no one build the

587
00:26:20,899 --> 00:26:25,850
capability to destroy it but no one does

588
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,490
that because marketing reasons so unless

589
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:30,169
it basically is legislated it won't

590
00:26:30,169 --> 00:26:32,690
happen there were a couple over here

591
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:35,830
yeah yeah

592
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:45,000
like it XP android apache and control

593
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,530
remote control of industrial control

594
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:48,480
systems once they're our guests all like

595
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,720
industrial purchases do at like four

596
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,570
distributed systems like Olivia I'm call

597
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:58,110
system like anger or Amazon or how's

598
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:02,030
this fall kind of expansive bigger

599
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:05,610
distributed file system that may or may

600
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:09,030
not have security certificate as time

601
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:11,629
goes on

602
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,870
rules I broke

603
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:16,630
or it's not different individual device

604
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:19,710
it's a bigger

605
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:22,220
so the question basically is how do I

606
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,260
deal with distributed systems which I'm

607
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,510
going to go back to my definition of

608
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:28,460
software system right so any set of

609
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,870
instructions that not in the same

610
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:32,210
environment are a system where so Asher

611
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:34,760
is one system that you have to is it I

612
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,769
don't know if I sure has different user

613
00:27:36,769 --> 00:27:39,440
votes or whatever but I think that if

614
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,120
you have the Amazon Cloud it spins up

615
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,700
the vm for you so you have the base OS

616
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,309
or the host OS right you have the

617
00:27:46,309 --> 00:27:48,169
virtualization software and then you

618
00:27:48,169 --> 00:27:50,029
have amazon package those are three

619
00:27:50,029 --> 00:27:52,070
systems clear from all of them I knew

620
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,539
would model them separately and so

621
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:55,460
whatever hopes to when someone stands up

622
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,929
like we'd see this with web content

623
00:27:56,929 --> 00:27:58,580
management stuff all the time right

624
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,710
those are host the virtualization

625
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:05,230
software there's there's papers from

626
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:08,240
2008 by a guy named Travis Normandy who

627
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,010
basically published that all of the

628
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:11,690
popular virtualization software at the

629
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,789
time could be exploited by a hostile

630
00:28:13,789 --> 00:28:16,340
guest to get control of the host he was

631
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:18,049
immediately hired by google and hasn't

632
00:28:18,049 --> 00:28:20,980
been heard from since then

633
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:24,010
I wish I were a joke like that's just

634
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:29,140
what happened to our they tell ya so um

635
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:32,380
and then the back end stuff I feel like

636
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:35,140
I saw once in the news that some amazon

637
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,860
management stuff have their password

638
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:41,169
entry page open for like two hours and

639
00:28:41,169 --> 00:28:42,549
someone got even guess the password and

640
00:28:42,549 --> 00:28:43,720
when did a bunch of mischief and then

641
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:47,970
amazon closed it down right so that's

642
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:52,540
the back end management side right which

643
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:55,299
has kind of obviously have fewer bolt in

644
00:28:55,299 --> 00:28:58,270
it but i think that it would be unwise

645
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:00,309
to think that there's not value in

646
00:29:00,309 --> 00:29:02,350
compromising with a whole back end for

647
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:04,030
google or the whole back end for amazon

648
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:06,280
and so if there is any capability to do

649
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,190
it because it runs on a living system

650
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,210
that it's they all right i haven't build

651
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:12,030
a whole new carnival far as I can help

652
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:15,030
so

653
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:17,350
all seen as

654
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:21,010
all the finest

655
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,100
I think that the what changes in the

656
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,510
model is you multiply the systems

657
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:28,860
together is something that I sort of in

658
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,060
response the marks question happens

659
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,160
actually a little bit outside the model

660
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:36,750
is the the risk of a compromise or the

661
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,820
damage done when I compromising curves

662
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:42,260
goes up and so the risk of the

663
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:46,020
cost-benefit should change right so if

664
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,330
you know that there's a system that 100

665
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:51,720
million people are using and you know

666
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,200
that it has you know this far along you

667
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,720
should adjust your equation to spend an

668
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,520
appropriate amount of money on the

669
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,970
security of it right we saw this I think

670
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:05,190
with the project Aurora stop crew right

671
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:06,990
they thought that gmail had no exposure

672
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:09,870
turned out to be targetable and then

673
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:12,690
they went on highland springs into it

674
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:14,550
just right I don't know what they put in

675
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:15,860
after that

676
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:18,510
but we've seen some instances of this

677
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,730
but they're obviously not as far along

678
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:23,400
as XP is partly because they're custom

679
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,500
systems right in part because there are

680
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,700
fewer of them so they're not as

681
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,150
targetable

682
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:38,190
yeah so say the use of Internet Explorer

683
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:41,190
doors

684
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:46,860
take one

685
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:54,490
yeah so what I would say that if you can

686
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:56,920
it all do it don't let anyone leave your

687
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,780
local network with Internet Explorer

688
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:05,110
I've seen presentations by the exploit

689
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:07,870
exploit intelligence project i want to

690
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:12,820
say where they measure some of this

691
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,950
stuff but what the guy also was doing

692
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:17,170
was he had a company that would sell me

693
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:18,820
basically plug in that just put chrome

694
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:21,850
inside his floor and ran to hold the

695
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:23,620
same boxes as if it were chrome unless

696
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,090
you went to a local network site is

697
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:26,320
trying to make that transparent for

698
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,730
everyone but yeah basically if you can

699
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:32,200
prevent people from leaving your home

700
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,570
that we're gone it's more that would cut

701
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:37,570
off some of that exposure and i know

702
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:38,830
that there's some program you just hope

703
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,900
required to run explore all over the

704
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,100
derivatives but

705
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:46,459
software in one

706
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,980
Stan

707
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,430
hey John

708
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:59,169
eliminate bad

709
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:02,710
so the very least definitely support at

710
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:04,179
least one other browser already here

711
00:32:04,179 --> 00:32:05,529
doing a software development thing

712
00:32:05,529 --> 00:32:07,690
please it we used to support something

713
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:09,340
besides explores if someone is always

714
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,889
able to make this other choice because

715
00:32:11,889 --> 00:32:13,299
some of the reason we have this problem

716
00:32:13,299 --> 00:32:16,090
is their websites that are critical that

717
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:17,980
are developed you two only run properly

718
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:20,679
against Explorer and that mean that the

719
00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:22,090
security folks can't do the right thing

720
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:23,340
and switch everyone to another browser

721
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:27,009
so yeah at least like Firefox isn't

722
00:32:27,009 --> 00:32:28,570
perfect but if you run Firefox at

723
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:30,519
windows I'm pretty sure that they have

724
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:32,320
to at least do something else wants to

725
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,210
get the browser to get the colonel I'm

726
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:37,019
not sure that's really true explorer

727
00:32:37,019 --> 00:32:39,159
like they're those other things that

728
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:40,629
they can do work sort of well known but

729
00:32:40,629 --> 00:32:43,469
they do these do it

730
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:46,370
yeah so this seems like the old or

731
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:47,900
something gets on the more widespread it

732
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,610
becomes the more expensive is to secure

733
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:52,070
but by the same token is less expensive

734
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,320
to support and so those two things are

735
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,030
inversely proportional is our sweet spot

736
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,980
where i can run something obscure enough

737
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:01,820
to not be a target but still so the

738
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:04,490
question was that something gets older

739
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:05,840
and better known is more expensive to

740
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,370
secure but it's also cheaper than

741
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:09,320
support so what's that like min max

742
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:14,179
function on this the optimal thing is

743
00:33:14,179 --> 00:33:16,880
going to be determined by how targeted

744
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:21,260
you are right so it depends on how many

745
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,960
people want your stuff look the more

746
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,429
attackers you have that watch your

747
00:33:25,429 --> 00:33:28,400
things the lower that sweet slots going

748
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,200
to be the more expensive security will

749
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,809
be if you're doing basically nothing

750
00:33:32,809 --> 00:33:34,460
important they only want to steal your

751
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:37,610
electricity or are bitcoins then it's

752
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:40,880
probably pretty far along you can use a

753
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,690
pretty common system

754
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,840
but also note that some of that cost in

755
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,610
securing is going to go into other

756
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,650
systems that are going front of these

757
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:54,770
systems so you can also budget it that

758
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:56,360
way right there like we're going to have

759
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,280
windows on the back end but that means

760
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:01,340
that you know the emails got to be

761
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,960
stripped or clean or whatever in a

762
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,370
certain way when we would sighing

763
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:07,220
attachments right from people who are in

764
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:09,379
your contact book right so everyone's

765
00:34:09,379 --> 00:34:11,120
going to run PGP or some sort of female

766
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,159
signing thing which outlook supports now

767
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:16,699
right so we do this from stuff but those

768
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:18,080
are the sort of costs you're going to

769
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:21,110
have not necessarily IP house but human

770
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:23,210
costs right so no one can receive

771
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:24,949
javascript in their email because

772
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:26,750
they're running a Windows machine what's

773
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:29,149
it son right so then you have to do a

774
00:34:29,149 --> 00:34:31,969
public key to allow for everyone but

775
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:33,530
that's the sort of concept I'm talking

776
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,060
about

777
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:38,230
what is one over here

778
00:34:41,129 --> 00:34:44,800
house uses various excuse wash floors

779
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,520
have no source so this certain innate

780
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:54,210
psychic abilities on the scene James's

781
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,730
so the question was is now are becoming

782
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:02,740
harder to text basically by calling

783
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:05,490
morphic stuff and all these things I

784
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:08,260
don't have that model here they think

785
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,700
that I've actually a reasonable separate

786
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,560
thing to model is their ability to

787
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:15,880
bypass not just a V but any sort of

788
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:20,140
malware analysis and so based on the

789
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,310
hall I would predict that they're

790
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:22,690
getting better at it I don't have

791
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:24,400
anything specific for you that I know I

792
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:30,280
can say about here

793
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,980
last question have you noticed any any

794
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,960
any trends with this model this crowd

795
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,710
exclaiming like it does it does it take

796
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:41,960
you no longer to go from discovered a

797
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,670
validation or for validating the

798
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:46,970
escalation oh just thinking ahead you

799
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:50,150
know if we see that a tool is happy at

800
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:53,300
the validation stage can we make any

801
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,400
generalizations about how far we might

802
00:35:55,400 --> 00:36:00,650
be general age generalization is a

803
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:02,060
little bit hard as I figured the

804
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,710
function of how many machines there are

805
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:05,030
so it's a function of the value

806
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,980
proposition for the attackers all right

807
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:09,830
so with the Android API this all fits on

808
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:12,500
one slide the matching one is grace

809
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:16,100
lines the XP one was two slides so they

810
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,360
move at different rates but I think

811
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,650
that's partly because it how'd you get

812
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:20,510
so much older they were just fewer web

813
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:22,940
servers period so there wasn't as much

814
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:25,970
value getting after them there is 800

815
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:28,220
million Android phones where it is so it

816
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:32,210
moves a lot faster but there's so

817
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:33,920
there's not a general rule but I'd like

818
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,690
to think that there's probably some sort

819
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:39,290
of relationship between the number of

820
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:42,950
devices and the number of people going

821
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:45,470
after it that you could come up with

822
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:46,480
something

823
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,460
but it's I don't have a hard and fast

824
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:52,810
one but it looks to be like so this

825
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:57,000
Android one goes real fast from

826
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,710
validation to democratization that's

827
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:03,000
like two two two two and a half years

828
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,859
and so I think that if we if you expect

829
00:37:05,859 --> 00:37:07,780
him a new popular tag out that's going

830
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,940
to hit a big segment of the global

831
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,470
population you should expect it to go

832
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:16,470
real fast thanks everyone
