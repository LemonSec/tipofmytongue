couple people added on you can see it so

11
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,750
isn't it a good time to be in the

12
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:45,030
security field a little ironic i guess

13
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,750
or sarcastic or i don't know it depends

14
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,550
of the day who here is not in infosec

15

percent they say unemployment rate for

19
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:07,910
infosec jobs that means there are

20
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:10,380

21
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,990

aren't in it we got a pretty good chance

24
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,190
of getting a job and getting in it so

25
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,010

26
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:26,900

to get these tables here in a runway

76
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,590

00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,380
pile of burritos some vegetarian ones

78
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:09,100

80
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,210
and on those sandwiches for 50 people or

81

so and if we run out of food I'm here

82
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,690
one of these sponsors who stood up will

83
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,988
probably quarter some stuff for us

84
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:21,988

85
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:26,840
