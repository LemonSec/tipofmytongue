1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,890
hi how's everyone has the conference

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:08,010
good awesome today Rob and I will be

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,290
talking about social engineering we'll

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,080
be doing kind of a share we talking

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,670
about the psychological aspect of social

6
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,890
engineering why we're so terrible at

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,199
defending against it and some of the

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,670
techniques that we can use rubb we'll be

9
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,519
talking about yeah I want to talk about

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,490
some experiences that we had during

11
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,269
social engineering engagements that

12
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:32,040
really were inspired this talk because

13
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,219
it got the the notion that quite a few

14
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:37,469
organizations were just giving up they

15
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:38,550
didn't really want to do social

16
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,379
engineering engagements because they're

17
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:41,940
like well we know that someone can get

18
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,800
in we're going to focus all our

19
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,680
resources elsewhere and just kind of

20
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,739
ignore the fact that we know someone an

21
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:51,360
organization could be coerced into

22
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,730
running a malicious payload or could be

23
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,860
tricked into giving their password to

24
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,410
someone but before we get into that

25
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,420
actually wanted to ask when you're here

26
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,710
is performed social engineering

27
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,129
assessments before okay a few people um

28
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:07,229
who's been a victim of social

29
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:13,680
engineering are you sure ah who has a

30
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,630
concern that their organization may be

31
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,420
or may have already been a victim of

32
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,549
social engineering attacks okay almost

33
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:27,090
everyone yeah so the the inspiration for

34
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:28,500
this came from kind of some of those

35
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,659
experiences but also while I was in the

36
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:33,439
shower listening to the foo fighters

37
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,579
like heard this lyric and I thought

38
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:37,290
about the pretender which made me think

39
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,790
of social engineers and also the never

40
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,649
surrender that that's really where the

41
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:47,430
inspiration for this game because so

42
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:53,009
many organizations really were kind of

43
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:55,829
giving us that that feedback that they

44
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:58,560
had given up and didn't want to didn't

45
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,149
really know what to do to protect

46
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:01,579
themselves against social engineering

47
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:06,270
and the other aspect of this was not the

48
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,489
pleasure an opportunity to work with one

49
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:09,720
of the best social engineering talents

50
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,190
in the industry which is Christina

51
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,760
so I kind of wanted to team up with her

52
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:22,599
and and put this together so just some

53
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:24,640
short introductions I'm Kristina I'm

54
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,620
actually from Australia i moved to San

55
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:31,120
Francisco a month ago upon entering

56
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,819
Pittsburgh I saw my first white-tailed

57
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:36,160
deer and my first lightning bugs all

58
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,709
yesterday which has been a new

59
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:41,709
experience for me I've participated in

60
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:43,930
the DEF CON social engineering CTF three

61
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,819
years in a row and I've won high scoring

62
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:49,690
recent report for two of those I wanted

63
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,040
to mention that she's basically going

64
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,829
for as many rings as the Steelers but

65
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:57,430
with DEFCON CTF challenges will tell you

66
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:01,209
later um sorry what was I gonna say next

67
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:04,480
I work as a pen tester and social

68
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,739
engineering has been an interest of mine

69
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:10,599
for many years admission Fox yeah we we

70
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:11,829
both work at an organization called

71
00:03:11,829 --> 00:03:13,420
Bishop Fox that helps organizations

72
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,549
secure their applications networks and

73
00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:19,480
data and my name is Rob I am a

74
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,910
pittsburgher I was born and raised here

75
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,000
I live in Atlanta now but I really

76
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,250
started into my hobby and then

77
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,650
eventually my profession with security

78
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:33,459
right here at PA 2600 meetings over at

79
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:35,739
the pit Student Union about 12 years ago

80
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:39,190
and actually there's some familiar faces

81
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,019
here and I don't know if it's from other

82
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:42,850
conferences or if it's from Pittsburgh

83
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:46,359
security stuff or just like my curse of

84
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:49,930
a photographic memory but um come ask me

85
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,989
my IRC handle unlike the PLP I 2600 and

86
00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:55,239
pound some work on channels maybe we

87
00:03:55,239 --> 00:04:00,130
know each other cool so let's get into

88
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,190
it let's get our hands dirty as always

89
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,630
I'll start with a definition of social

90
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,569
engineering for anyone that doesn't know

91
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:09,130
this definition is taken from social

92
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,889
engineer org and is defined as the act

93
00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:13,660
of manipulating people into performing

94
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,280
actions or divulging confidential

95
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,858
information and I like to think of

96
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:19,720
social engineering as a blend of science

97
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,960
psychology and art it taps into basic

98
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,880
human emotions and it looks at why we

99
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,310
react

100
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:28,520
the way that we do when I talk about

101
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,090
social engineers I like to explain them

102
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:34,610
as people that study people truly

103
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,440
committed social engineers will study a

104
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,510
lot about body language voice control

105
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:41,720
vocal indicators and group dynamics it's

106
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,580
also a study of introverted individual

107
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,770
personality types that come out through

108
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:50,330
body language and vocal cues a more

109
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,360
simple definition of social engineering

110
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,550
would be an exploitation of trust it's

111
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,110
someone who can leverage a trust of

112
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,419
their victim to gain access to sensitive

113
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:01,610
information or resources or to elicit

114
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:04,850
information about those resources the

115
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:06,889
use of social engineering is successful

116
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,900
because it preys not on technology but

117
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,400
on the inherit weakness of the human

118
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,280
component and this is done by

119
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,110
manipulating the human victim with

120
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:17,470
messages that can exploit your trust

121
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:20,060
pick your interests and desires and

122
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,860
evoke a strong range of human emotions

123
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,860
such as fear anxiety trust human

124
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:28,760
interest and reward but to make this

125
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,950
very very simple we are professional

126
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,870
liars social engineers are people that

127
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:36,410
can lie and get something that yeah

128
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:39,890
specially gonna say that like being

129
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,930
charming is another way that you can put

130
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,550
it and that's not really a compliment if

131
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,169
someone calls you charming if the true

132
00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:47,780
definition of that is actually very like

133
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:55,220
sly and sneaky not like you rub when

134
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,960
people are vulnerable people are lazy

135
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,240
people want to be helpful and people

136
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,970
want to be nerdist making this field and

137
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,650
especially enticing target or making

138
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:07,130
people especially enticing target as a

139
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,350
really simple example of this we can

140
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,180
spend hours weeks or months to train a

141
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,400
brute force our way to a password when

142
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,160
crafting the right pretext or sorry when

143
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,810
a phone call with the right pretext and

144
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,910
the right questions can get you the same

145
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:21,229
information or more in a matter of

146
00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:23,440
minutes

147
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,669
and that's exactly it social engineering

148
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:30,310
is the path of least resistance it's the

149
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,710
low-hanging fruit so utilizing

150
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:34,210
techniques such as planning the right

151
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:36,669
pretext sorry pretext is like creating

152
00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:38,860
and using a contrived scenario

153
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,139
exploiting someone's trust and appealing

154
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:42,819
to sounds emotions often results in

155
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,639
obtaining the same piece of information

156
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,500
it it's almost unbelievable or you can

157
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,110
achieve by simply posing looking we're

158
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:58,270
looking like someone else this is

159
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,919
something that we're both very

160
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,120
passionate about I think that as an

161
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,800
organization how many people in here are

162
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,319
information security professionals okay

163
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,610
that's what I thought just wanted to

164
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:12,669
make sure I was recently on a panel at

165
00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:15,789
interop out in Las Vegas and the first

166
00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:17,259
person that kind of kicked off the

167
00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:20,379
conversation said users are our biggest

168
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:22,120
problem if we could just get rid of the

169
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,620
users that we'd have no more problems

170
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:26,469
and I just leaned it and I was like I

171
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:31,029
disagree i think that that's really

172
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:34,659
deferring the blame and we as security

173
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:38,380
professionals it's it's our job to help

174
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,880
I don't even like calling them users

175
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,740
their people that's like kind of even

176
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:45,120
demeaning calling them users ah it's

177
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,259
adrian and porter felt she's the head of

178
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:50,650
security for chrome user security for

179
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,750
chrome and so she has to deal with a lot

180
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,229
of folks that don't really care what ssl

181
00:07:56,229 --> 00:07:59,050
is they don't they have no idea no

182
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:01,289
inclination no motivation to understand

183
00:08:01,289 --> 00:08:04,629
ssl warnings or even what that acronym

184
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:06,909
means so it's our job as security

185
00:08:06,909 --> 00:08:10,240
professionals to help the firefighters

186
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:16,319
and the blog babysitters and the

187
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,680
grandmothers of the world know that they

188
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,460
can use the internet and still be safe

189
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,800
and striking that balance between

190
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,069
usability and security is I think one of

191
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:31,840
the biggest challenges but I would like

192
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,380
to stop having the notion that users are

193
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,850
our biggest problem and

194
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,380
just start coming up with some technical

195
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,809
controls and some changes to our

196
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:44,179
policies and our processes and how we

197
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:48,560
interact with people to address the the

198
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,360
issue and I'm continuing on from rubs

199
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,950
point controlling humans is difficult

200
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,300
because it's beyond technological

201
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,070
control and absolutely subject to human

202
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:04,520
nature and because we can't put controls

203
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,070
on the way each individual thanks making

204
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,900
this a very very challenging aspect of

205
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:13,670
security to handle again to keep this

206
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,800
simple people are the root of all evil

207
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,570
and we are the reason for all security

208
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:22,760
issues and this is because there is no

209
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:27,050
patch for human stupidity how long do i

210
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,630
wait for everyone to read the coming

211
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:31,100
most people probably seen this before in

212
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,100
your head this is where I go take a

213
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:40,250
drink when you combine people with

214
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,900
technology you will encounter problems

215
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:46,250
humans are unreliable technical systems

216
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,930
when we think about technical systems

217
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:50,120
they're reviewed their scanned their

218
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,100
penetration their pen tested sorry I

219
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,340
don't like seeing penetration tested but

220
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,960
how about people how do we measure

221
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,650
vulnerabilities in people and the answer

222
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,540
is we don't at least we don't do it

223
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,090
effectively we like to make people feel

224
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:07,490
shameful we like to pass blame we like

225
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,140
to ignore the problem while not doing

226
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,850
anything to help to really help the

227
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:15,380
situation and an on this note I actually

228
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,330
had a client tell me well a couple

229
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,040
clients tell me once that they did not

230
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,660
want to do a social engineering test

231
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,490
simply because they knew that they would

232
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:23,690
be vulnerable and then this is

233
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,220
absolutely not the right attitude to

234
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,430
have

235
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,650
and when I thought about why the client

236
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:36,350
reacted this way I thought well we don't

237
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:39,560
like to do this testing because it makes

238
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:45,530
us feel vulnerable and we don't like to

239
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:48,770
feel vulnerable and when you combine

240
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:51,440
people with technology you get this big

241
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:59,870
blob of mess and the fact that people

242
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:03,650
are really unreliable means that we need

243
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:05,480
to come up with just a whole new

244
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,700
approach and I think there's a lot of

245
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,990
technical controls that are

246
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:14,960
underutilized there's a lot of the whole

247
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,930
going back to the shaming and blaming

248
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:20,140
approach I've heard so many clients that

249
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:23,150
that's their that's their mindset going

250
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:27,290
into solving this problem and it it

251
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:29,270
doesn't work I've seen it seen it tried

252
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,590
over and over again so it becomes our

253
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:34,730
job to try to convince them to take it

254
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,800
to take another route and to really

255
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,600
assess what their goals are and then

256
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,840
really ask themselves is is shaming and

257
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,030
blaming your employees or your your

258
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:47,710
co-workers going to help the situation

259
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:50,120
so what Rob saying is people are

260
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,610
unreliable and we can't rely on just the

261
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:55,550
human aspect to fix this problem and

262
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,590
this is because again people fall victim

263
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:59,150
to basic psychological and physical

264
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,950
needs and people can be easily

265
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:03,530
manipulated and persuaded I like to give

266
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:07,130
the example of the sea aldini six which

267
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:10,790
are six useful frames when it comes to

268
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:13,400
social engineering and this affect your

269
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,130
persuasion and those can be broken down

270
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:19,220
into authority so we tend to be

271
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,920
influenced by authority positions liking

272
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,720
we're influenced by those that we like

273
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,089
social proof we look to others to

274
00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:28,730
determine good behavior scarcity our

275
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:31,660
value is tied to our availability

276
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,250
reciprocation so we feel like we have an

277
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,380
obligation to return what other people

278
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,160
provide so just like favors

279
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,930
commitment and sorry i miss Cassidy

280
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:44,920
Cassidy did I say I did say scarcity

281
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,340
social proof is the one I missed differ

282
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,800
all right sorry I'll just go to the last

283
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,990
one and commitment and consistency so we

284
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:55,670
are pressured to remain consistent with

285
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:59,420
prior engagements I did okay I can't

286
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:02,540
count she also stayed up all night

287
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,010
working on these slides and didn't sleep

288
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:07,010
so Shh I I spent all week working on

289
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,240
these I did not leave it to the last

290
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,290
minute him so let me tell you a story

291
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:16,280
this is one of my favorite stories at my

292
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,310
previous job on an engagement I had I

293
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:22,040
had posed as an internal employee for a

294
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,950
law enforcement agency and I did some

295
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:27,080
recon dances recon insists on this

296
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,270
person or the person I chose as my

297
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,880
target and after doing some research I

298
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,310
found that she was on holidays at Hawaii

299
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:37,310
and I found this on her Facebook and

300
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,750
from this information i crafted a

301
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,580
pretext on the information that I knew

302
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,370
and that is that she came back early

303
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:45,350
from her holiday buildings a pretext

304
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:47,630
sorry she tell them what a pretext to a

305
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:50,150
pretext I think I mentioned it before

306
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:53,080
but a pretext is like crafting a

307
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,980
scenario that you were going to follow

308
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,540
when you do a social engineer engagement

309
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:05,030
so in this sense a pretext sorry the

310
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,320
pretext that I created for this scenario

311
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,940
was that I came back early from her

312
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:11,990
white her holiday to Hawaii and that I

313
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,580
needed to urgently finish a report from

314
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,290
my manager and that was the story that I

315
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:18,950
created for this scenario and from this

316
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:20,570
story I had created a sense of urgency

317
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:24,080
and when you create that sense of

318
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,600
urgency they were naturally inclined to

319
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,260
help and from there while I was on the

320
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,840
phone impersonating this person I had

321
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,010
managed to get ahold of the IT

322
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:35,570
department using the same sense of

323
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,640
urgency and praising them for being so

324
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,490
helpful I said to the person on the

325
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:44,960
phone let's call him Rob hey Rob I

326
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,820
really really need to finish this report

327
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,520
but I know I've forgotten both my domain

328
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,170
and my email passwords because I've been

329
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:52,370
on holidays

330
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,290
I'm so so sorry can you please help me

331
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:59,150
out and what was most surprising is that

332
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,980
I got exactly what I wanted which were

333
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,350
both passwords read over to me read to

334
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,150
me over the phone with absolutely no

335
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:07,910
cross-checking that I was who I actually

336
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:10,670
said that I was apart from me being the

337
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:14,240
same gender as her and what was the most

338
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,360
amusing is the guy said I'm not supposed

339
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,060
to do this but and gave me both

340
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,120
passwords he had also asked me what I

341
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,100
wanted to set it to you and I said or

342
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,529
Mike I'm sorry it's a rub I've been on

343
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:29,870
holidays and i'm still in holiday modes

344
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:30,920
can you please set it to something

345
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,260
simple and he said okay sure i'll set it

346
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,029
to password one but I pull a dollar sign

347
00:15:35,029 --> 00:15:36,380
in front just to make it a little bit

348
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:42,020
more secure thank you rob but the point

349
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,420
of this story is that this works because

350
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,640
most people trust others by default and

351
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,880
respond to social rewards well many

352
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,830
people especially customer service

353
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,510
agents help desk receptionists and

354
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:56,360
business assistance or even secretaries

355
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,490
who were trained to assist people and

356
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,290
not to question the valid a look the

357
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:03,350
validity of each request tend to trust

358
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,540
others and I'm naturally helpful that's

359
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,760
worth two factor right oh yeah sorry I'm

360
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,860
sorry forgot to mention that before i

361
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,779
got my passwords read to me over the

362
00:16:11,779 --> 00:16:14,480
phone he asked for my TF a token i put

363
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,220
the phone down and i went into the

364
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,810
background i made lots of noise as if i

365
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,400
was looking through my knowledge for

366
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,690
about two minutes i came back to the

367
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:22,580
phone and said Rob I've looked

368
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,350
everywhere I've turned my luggage inside

369
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,850
out and I cannot find my two-factor

370
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:29,600
authentication 2fa token so they did

371
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,520
have the right technical controls in

372
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,820
place by bypassing this through

373
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:40,180
psychological means avoided all of that

374
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:44,540
and following on from that I'd also like

375
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,340
to mention that this is this inherit

376
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,500
trust that we put into social media it

377
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,210
was because she posted that she was on

378
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,950
holidays on social and media in the

379
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,810
first place that I knew how to craft

380
00:16:53,810 --> 00:17:00,620
this pretext did you have a question yes

381
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,660
so this was back in Australia when I

382
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,130
worked in Australia and she was

383
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:09,820
Australian and I am Australian yeah oh

384
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:16,640
sorry still me so let me show you how

385
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,890
this worked or a very simple attack

386
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:22,819
model of this story I just told so we

387
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:24,920
really just need to can you even see

388
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,690
that not really gather the right

389
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:28,580
information develop a relationship with

390
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,080
whoever your target is be it through

391
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,750
small talk or a common interest

392
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,160
exploiting that trust and executing your

393
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,370
attack now I can hand it over to rob

394
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:39,500
enough about the fluffy stuff barb is

395
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,820
going to talk about what we're doing

396
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:45,890
wrong yeah and that scenario arm it was

397
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:48,520
nice that there was two factor

398
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,650
authentication but the fact that there

399
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,270
was no process to authenticate the

400
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,490
person over the phone and it was merely

401
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:59,120
a christina was able to create this

402
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,930
sense of urgency to coerce the gentleman

403
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:06,110
on the other line to give not only a new

404
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:10,040
password tour but also a new 2fa token'

405
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,700
value and then allow VPN access into a

406
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:21,550
law enforcement agency so let's go into

407
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:25,610
what we're doing wrong it really is

408
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:34,940
almost everything we have users watch

409
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,070
training videos they do elearning

410
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:42,230
modules on they tick boxes and there's

411
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,740
posters hanging up in the office but I

412
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:49,130
think that helps folks feel good about

413
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,990
themselves from a security awareness

414
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:53,180
training perspective

415
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:56,930
but what we're seeing as consultants

416
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,970
that are hired to repeatedly perform

417
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,860
these types of assessments is that that

418
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,860
these techniques are not working at all

419
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:09,760
but organizations are still repeating ly

420
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,990
putting more and more resources into

421
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,670
these types of security awareness

422
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:16,820
campaigns and i think that the big

423
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,500
takeaway that we hope they have after

424
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,120
some of the things we'd like to show you

425
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,370
next is that there are other things that

426
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,930
we can spend our time and resources on

427
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:27,410
besides more computer-based training and

428
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:30,230
and posters around the office saying

429
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,720
don't don't trust christina when she

430
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,850
calls you so some of the things that

431
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:40,850
I've noticed from or different

432
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,170
organizations that we perform social

433
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:45,140
engineering on is that they tend to fail

434
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,570
with how they track their social

435
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,970
engineering assessments the frequency

436
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:51,890
that they're doing security awareness

437
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,950
training is also a concern and the

438
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:57,560
conditioning of their the members of the

439
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,750
organization so let's get in a little

440
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:05,630
bit more details tracking stop tracking

441
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:08,810
clicks the number of clicks that occur

442
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:12,850
in a social engineering campaign I

443
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:15,680
haven't really seen be as useful as as

444
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,670
folks would hope tracking by Department

445
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:21,020
is something that we've been asked to do

446
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:23,210
as well because as if there's some type

447
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:24,950
of statistical correlation between the

448
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,330
number of people in the sales department

449
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:28,070
that click versus the number of people

450
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:31,100
in the Executive Board group or the

451
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,260
people in marketing or recruiting

452
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,420
division I don't know why a graph that

453
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:39,430
shows that is helpful because

454
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:41,150
statistically the sample size was

455
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,250
probably not big enough to make any type

456
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:47,200
of valuable correlation out of that and

457
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,310
we can say that we've done this enough

458
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,050
times that it doesn't matter we get

459
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,210
senior network system administrators to

460
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:59,510
click on fishing scenarios we get every

461
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,389
type of employee it doesn't matter

462
00:21:01,389 --> 00:21:04,839
and all we need is one in most cases to

463
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:09,339
compromise an internal network in a lot

464
00:21:09,339 --> 00:21:10,959
of old social engineering engagements

465
00:21:10,959 --> 00:21:13,149
I've had in the past I had a lot of

466
00:21:13,149 --> 00:21:15,639
clients come up to me and ask for the

467
00:21:15,639 --> 00:21:18,190
people's names after an engagement so

468
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:20,349
they wanted if I had a pool of 20 people

469
00:21:20,349 --> 00:21:22,809
also and six of them fell for the social

470
00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:24,219
engineering engagement that come up to

471
00:21:24,219 --> 00:21:26,320
me and say Christina can you give me the

472
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,700
names of departments of the people that

473
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,950
fell fell for the social engineering

474
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,929
engagement and this is not the right

475
00:21:31,929 --> 00:21:33,669
attitude to have you do not want to

476
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:35,679
victimize anyone you do not want to

477
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,719
create a paranoid culture and I always

478
00:21:37,719 --> 00:21:40,269
refused on the phone I said no sorry I

479
00:21:40,269 --> 00:21:43,089
will not hand over the names for the

480
00:21:43,089 --> 00:21:44,349
social engineering engagement because

481
00:21:44,349 --> 00:21:46,269
you have to understand that this problem

482
00:21:46,269 --> 00:21:48,820
is on a company level not an individual

483
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:52,659
basis you cannot pass blame onto people

484
00:21:52,659 --> 00:21:54,219
for this for these sort of engagements

485
00:21:54,219 --> 00:22:00,219
all the time that's a good question sir

486
00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:01,539
have you been social engineered into

487
00:22:01,539 --> 00:22:05,200
giving those results I like we have

488
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,029
given those results to some clients that

489
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:11,049
really it was a part of their motivation

490
00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:14,409
to address it on the personal level but

491
00:22:14,409 --> 00:22:16,869
that again was an exercise where they

492
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:19,929
spent time and resources on coaching an

493
00:22:19,929 --> 00:22:23,109
individual when I guarantee you we can

494
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:24,639
just pick 20 more people to target and

495
00:22:24,639 --> 00:22:27,669
we'll get half of them to click as well

496
00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:29,320
and then what do you do you just go to

497
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,419
talk to every single person and train

498
00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:33,399
them one by one and try to make them

499
00:22:33,399 --> 00:22:35,619
terrified of of everything that they do

500
00:22:35,619 --> 00:22:40,559
with computer resources and on their job

501
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,489
what I would suggest instead and I've

502
00:22:42,489 --> 00:22:45,159
not I'm not just suggesting this because

503
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:46,269
I think it's a good idea I've seen it

504
00:22:46,269 --> 00:22:49,029
work there's some organizations that are

505
00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:51,609
more mature i would say on how they're

506
00:22:51,609 --> 00:22:53,649
handling these issues and we've had the

507
00:22:53,649 --> 00:22:55,389
fortunate perspective to see what works

508
00:22:55,389 --> 00:22:57,879
and what doesn't work and tracking the

509
00:22:57,879 --> 00:23:01,409
successes has been tremendous for a

510
00:23:01,409 --> 00:23:03,339
couple of organizations that we work

511
00:23:03,339 --> 00:23:05,169
really closely with what i mean by that

512
00:23:05,169 --> 00:23:06,820
is rather than tracking the clicks or

513
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,559
how many people were were compromised

514
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,609
track the number of people that reported

515
00:23:12,609 --> 00:23:14,679
an incident

516
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:17,509
because our best hope in defending

517
00:23:17,509 --> 00:23:19,309
against these types of attacks is going

518
00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:20,960
to be our incident response plan that is

519
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,149
specific to social engineering attacks

520
00:23:23,149 --> 00:23:28,369
and at that point whenever you take the

521
00:23:28,369 --> 00:23:30,710
charts and graphs to the executives that

522
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:33,289
are sponsoring the security budget your

523
00:23:33,289 --> 00:23:35,330
charts going to be going up ideally

524
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,190
rather than going down rather than

525
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:38,389
trying to get the number of people that

526
00:23:38,389 --> 00:23:41,179
clicked to go down which is going to

527
00:23:41,179 --> 00:23:43,909
fluctuate what for example one

528
00:23:43,909 --> 00:23:45,919
organization that we worked with a we're

529
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,839
using like a service like fish me that

530
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:54,200
does teachable moments you send up big

531
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,759
pool of emails they click and then it

532
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:56,989
says hey you this was actually fishing

533
00:23:56,989 --> 00:23:58,519
here's some training on why you

534
00:23:58,519 --> 00:23:59,769
shouldn't have done what you just did

535
00:23:59,769 --> 00:24:03,559
which is all fine and well and they were

536
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:08,599
doing it every quarter for three years

537
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:12,710
and with varying a number of emails that

538
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,960
they sent because with that bit with the

539
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,099
fish meat business model you have to pay

540
00:24:16,099 --> 00:24:22,009
per email that sent and they started out

541
00:24:22,009 --> 00:24:23,779
with a few hundred started ramped it up

542
00:24:23,779 --> 00:24:25,460
to a few thousand they eventually on the

543
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:28,609
last one that I reviewed with them send

544
00:24:28,609 --> 00:24:29,690
an email to every member of the

545
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:32,749
organization through this fishing

546
00:24:32,749 --> 00:24:35,149
campaign eight thousand people at this

547
00:24:35,149 --> 00:24:39,589
organization how many do you think still

548
00:24:39,589 --> 00:24:41,149
clicked after three years of quarterly

549
00:24:41,149 --> 00:24:46,849
training on this any guesses a thousand

550
00:24:46,849 --> 00:24:50,809
one-eighth still clicked so there's a

551
00:24:50,809 --> 00:24:56,559
lot of time and resources sure no

552
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,350
Oh

553
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:11,400
they their internal security team made a

554
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,890
really nice Prezi presentation that they

555
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:15,540
would deliver to the different business

556
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,800
units that they thought needed more

557
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,080
attention that would help raise

558
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,820
awareness of all of the types of attacks

559
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,770
that they are commonly targeted with

560
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:25,410
isolated a media organization and they

561
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:27,750
do a lot they have a lot of politically

562
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,700
motivated threats that are targeting

563
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,660
their employees they have a lot of

564
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,980
celebrities that work at their

565
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,900
organization and they are explicitly

566
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,230
targeted for their personal information

567
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:39,930
and having 8,000 employees in an

568
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:42,240
organization like that and a finite

569
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,490
budget for their security team and very

570
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:49,260
very motivated attackers became a you

571
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,670
know that fortunately they actually did

572
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:52,050
even they have a finite budget it's

573
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,220
still pretty large compared to most

574
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,650
organizations and so they it it just

575
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:57,660
that was part of their package was like

576
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,910
let's fish me everyone every quarter

577
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:02,700
just because we can afford that but I

578
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,080
compare that with another organization

579
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,520
that's also very large and I saw them

580
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,920
tracking the number of incident response

581
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:11,040
submissions and basically so creating a

582
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,310
culture in an environment where rather

583
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:17,700
than try to go give more training to the

584
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,990
people that are clicking more they were

585
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:21,540
rewarding the groups that were reporting

586
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:28,110
more incidents you know so ideally that

587
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,490
awareness training that's being

588
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:31,740
performed should feed into this strong

589
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,320
incident response plan that is

590
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,850
specifically geared for social

591
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:37,230
engineering how many people in here have

592
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:40,620
a detailed incident response plan that

593
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,940
the exercise regularly at the

594
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:45,330
organization good on how many have one

595
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:47,040
that's very specific for social

596
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,900
engineering for like a fishing campaign

597
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:52,670
or for a phone based social engineering

598
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:55,890
physical some folks some are some

599
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,620
organizations one of our clients that

600
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:00,060
they're another media organization

601
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:02,040
actually they have to worry about bomb

602
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,570
threats and people bringing guns and

603
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:05,220
knives in and they have like kids on

604
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,770
field trips in their organization every

605
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:11,220
day and they worry about very serious

606
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,540
physical threats but they don't worry

607
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,940
about the geek like me that walks in and

608
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:17,059
plugs in something into the network well

609
00:27:17,059 --> 00:27:20,659
Jack in the hallway that is in the

610
00:27:20,659 --> 00:27:22,639
elevator lobby that's on a VoIP phone

611
00:27:22,639 --> 00:27:24,590
that still connects into the internal

612
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:28,149
network that's behind that locked door

613
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,919
but well this is kind of quintessential

614
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,059
to some of our recommendations and

615
00:27:35,059 --> 00:27:36,320
takeaways from this presentation is

616
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,629
having a plan specifically for social

617
00:27:38,629 --> 00:27:40,309
engineering can put a organization in a

618
00:27:40,309 --> 00:27:42,620
much better position to react whenever

619
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:48,080
these types of attacks do occur i also

620
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,730
have an issue with the frequency that

621
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:52,730
some organizations do awareness training

622
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:54,879
again I think it's a time and resources

623
00:27:54,879 --> 00:27:57,110
matter and maybe your organization has a

624
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,759
lot of resources to put into awareness

625
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:01,220
training but I think there's actually

626
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,559
there I found quite a few there's

627
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:04,460
actually Harvard Business School

628
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:06,590
research paper on the amount of

629
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,119
diversity training your organization

630
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,830
does starts to have diminishing returns

631
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,210
and actually the opposite effect on

632
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:13,610
people's mindsets the more you kind of

633
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:14,929
shove diversity training down their

634
00:28:14,929 --> 00:28:17,210
throat I think the same thing happens

635
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:20,769
with security awareness training and I

636
00:28:20,769 --> 00:28:22,519
want to tell a story about an

637
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:23,899
organization that asked us to do very

638
00:28:23,899 --> 00:28:25,730
frequent training and it really tried to

639
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:28,429
convince them otherwise but the other

640
00:28:28,429 --> 00:28:31,909
thing was the conditioning aspect the

641
00:28:31,909 --> 00:28:36,019
negative reinforcement and and rather

642
00:28:36,019 --> 00:28:39,080
than rubbing the people in the

643
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,909
organization's nose in this problem like

644
00:28:40,909 --> 00:28:42,679
they're a dog and like demeaning and

645
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,779
degrading them for clicking on a fishing

646
00:28:44,779 --> 00:28:49,070
link which very well anyone could make a

647
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:51,710
very very convincing email or very very

648
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:54,889
convincing web application and some

649
00:28:54,889 --> 00:28:57,259
people are very tricky and can talk you

650
00:28:57,259 --> 00:28:58,429
into doing almost anything over the

651
00:28:58,429 --> 00:29:01,519
phone I think using positive

652
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:06,230
reinforcement to if the person the

653
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:07,549
organization reported that incident

654
00:29:07,549 --> 00:29:09,799
track that reward them and make them a

655
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:12,860
good example for others to follow and I

656
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,659
think if we're asking how can we get

657
00:29:14,659 --> 00:29:16,220
organization on the defensive against

658
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,830
social engineering it's making reporting

659
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:21,799
these incidents easy making it the

660
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:26,409
default behavior and making it rewarding

661
00:29:26,409 --> 00:29:29,779
so another story was specifically around

662
00:29:29,779 --> 00:29:31,890
a

663
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:33,940
an organization that came to us and

664
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,350
wanted us to develop their social

665
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:36,790
engineering defenses for the customer

666
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:40,000
support representatives they had 4,000

667
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,010
approx customer support representatives

668
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,950
around the world some of them local to

669
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,730
the US some of them in India some other

670
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:52,270
offshore areas and some are just entire

671
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:54,730
external third parties that they don't

672
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:56,710
have a lot of control over what goes on

673
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:00,040
inside those those organizations other

674
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,540
than what their legal team can get into

675
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:04,930
a contract so arm currently they were

676
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:06,340
kind of training and simulating se

677
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:10,720
scenarios when they came to us on an ad

678
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,170
hoc basis and they were had some

679
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:15,970
incidents they had attackers calling in

680
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:17,440
and coercing customer service

681
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,790
representatives into giving them access

682
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:21,030
to personally identifiable information

683
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:25,960
access to customer accounts and on top

684
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,490
of that they were regularly receiving

685
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:28,690
emails that were actually a phishing

686
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:30,430
scam so that was like risk number one as

687
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,360
they're describing to me all their

688
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,950
problems I didn't have a risk number

689
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:33,820
ones you're already having these

690
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,290
incidents you're already getting these

691
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:38,770
regulatory phishing scam emails and

692
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:42,130
these emails would prompt them to reset

693
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:44,080
their passwords on regular occurrence

694
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,520
and then kind of trick these

695
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,720
representatives into giving up their

696
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,660
passwords the second risk identified

697
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,530
from the problems they were describing

698
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:52,690
was that they were occasionally getting

699
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:55,630
malware infections on the customer the

700
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:59,650
CSRs terminals just for not they

701
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:00,790
probably weren't even sure how that was

702
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:01,810
happening they just would they're

703
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,100
incident response was just to image it

704
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,930
not really get to a root cause analysis

705
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:11,350
of why that was happening and the there

706
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:13,150
was kind of a lot of different problems

707
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:17,500
that they were describing and they

708
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,200
wanted us to do monthly security

709
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,700
awareness training it's basically

710
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,410
sending phishing emails and sending and

711
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:25,480
doing phone calls on a monthly basis and

712
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:29,020
then their plan was to fire repeat

713
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:32,500
offenders and I they had a new see so

714
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,970
join recently and I know that she was

715
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:37,810
actually firing heads of departments

716
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:39,670
because in the security unit because

717
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:41,230
they didn't have a good relationship

718
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,790
with the other business units and she

719
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:43,710
felt that they couldn't

720
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:46,049
anything effectively done because they

721
00:31:46,049 --> 00:31:48,990
had the reputation of will steamroll you

722
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:52,260
or will go around you or will you'll get

723
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,260
fired if you don't do what security says

724
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:57,870
and that was creating all kinds of

725
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:00,720
office politics that I think we had

726
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,860
identified as consultants that I've been

727
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,320
working with them for a while so we're

728
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:07,049
basically tried to recommend a

729
00:32:07,049 --> 00:32:10,580
multi-phased approach that involved

730
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:14,760
doing some social engineering and

731
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,620
security awareness training but perhaps

732
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:20,100
monthly was overkill until they had some

733
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,380
other plans in place to review those

734
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,610
terminals that the customer service

735
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:25,169
representatives were using like asking

736
00:32:25,169 --> 00:32:27,090
policy questions like why do they have

737
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:28,700
internet access do they really need

738
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:31,140
access to everything can we just give

739
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,789
them an iPad to surf the internet on if

740
00:32:32,789 --> 00:32:33,980
they're bored at work in between

741
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:38,700
customer support calls can we whitelist

742
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,159
every application and software that runs

743
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:43,200
on those systems as well and detect any

744
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,899
anomalies and abnormal behavior to

745
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:47,730
prevent that risk of the malware

746
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:48,779
infections that were occurring on a

747
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:52,110
regular basis can we redesign the

748
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,820
security questions that they use as the

749
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:54,960
authentication process whenever

750
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,720
customers call in and say that they need

751
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,279
to change their address or change their

752
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,330
phone number or change the billing

753
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:01,860
update the billing information on their

754
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,840
account are they really doing a good job

755
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,960
of or do they know that there's websites

756
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,730
out there that you can pay 99 cents and

757
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:10,350
get anyone's social security number with

758
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:12,000
just their name and their maybe one

759
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,720
address that they've had in their life

760
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,330
so kind of bringing that some of those

761
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:22,500
to lighten and asking them to take this

762
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,169
approach where we use social engineering

763
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,960
as the tip of a spear integrate that

764
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,340
with penetration testing of some of

765
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,630
their internal applications and the

766
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:31,860
applications that the customer support

767
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:34,100
representives rely on a regular basis

768
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,000
reviewing their incident response plan

769
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,210
and how they're going to handle us

770
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:40,230
incidents that were already happening on

771
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:42,840
a regular basis there what there was no

772
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,960
specific incident response plan for it

773
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,020
and really analyzing what their plan was

774
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,779
for the their people their processes and

775
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,820
their policies are related to social

776
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:57,240
engineering flowing that into what

777
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,890
enterprise security technical controls

778
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:02,610
can we implement and we have actually

779
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:07,700
like a list of 12 of them that I want to

780
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:11,790
want to get into would you talking a

781
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:12,719
little bit more about some of the

782
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,090
technical controls and defenses around

783
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:21,690
like well I pull this up sorry about

784
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:24,350
like what you see

785
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:27,020
it's your decks

786
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:34,339
I'm just going to wait for you to pull

787
00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:37,190
these up I can tell Don story dude all

788
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,449
right I'll tell another story in the

789
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:41,569
meantime I wanted to in this

790
00:34:41,569 --> 00:34:43,399
presentation talk a little bit about the

791
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:46,159
trust that we put in social media and at

792
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:48,579
the Def Con and social engineering CTF

793
00:34:48,579 --> 00:34:50,780
one of the challenges was we got a

794
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:55,699
fortune 100 company and sat a dinosaur

795
00:34:55,699 --> 00:35:00,319
my company was was bowing and the goal

796
00:35:00,319 --> 00:35:03,319
of this CTF was there was a list of 35

797
00:35:03,319 --> 00:35:04,819
questions that you had to answer and

798
00:35:04,819 --> 00:35:06,530
they ranged from whose the garbage

799
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:08,150
disposal company to getting someone

800
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,619
internally to click on a link that you

801
00:35:09,619 --> 00:35:12,170
sent them and the way that I did this

802
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:15,349
was I created a very fictitious

803
00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:17,960
character called naomi wolf and naomi

804
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,910
wolf was completely fabricated she did

805
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:22,640
not exist in real life but fur Naomi I

806
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,369
created her a fake facebook fate

807
00:35:25,369 --> 00:35:30,380
linkedin fake Twitter and over a few

808
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,480
weeks I built up these profiles i added

809
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,339
people from boeing who worked their

810
00:35:34,339 --> 00:35:37,490
managers co-workers everyone that i

811
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:39,049
could get ahold of just through social

812
00:35:39,049 --> 00:35:42,380
media and and after a few weeks i found

813
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,299
that the job was doing itself i started

814
00:35:44,299 --> 00:35:45,650
getting friend requests linkedin

815
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:47,059
requests from people that worked for the

816
00:35:47,059 --> 00:35:49,130
company i actually got a manager that

817
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:52,190
worked for boeing messaging me on

818
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:54,440
facebook and say hey Naomi how's your

819
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,750
internship sorry so I was posing as an

820
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:59,839
intern an aeronautical engineer intern

821
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:02,839
and he messaged me saying Naomi how are

822
00:36:02,839 --> 00:36:04,579
you enjoying your internship thus far I

823
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,710
would love to meet up with you and get

824
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:08,839
to know you and get some feedback on our

825
00:36:08,839 --> 00:36:12,049
internship program and I thought that

826
00:36:12,049 --> 00:36:13,730
was absolutely frightening that this

827
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:18,069
this person that I created completely

828
00:36:18,069 --> 00:36:23,150
from like this person I completely made

829
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:26,200
up in just a few weeks she was

830
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,400
considered to be a real person a real

831
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,020
employee that worked for Boeing and

832
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:34,339
using those connections I was able to

833
00:36:34,339 --> 00:36:36,410
get people to click links that I had

834
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:38,270
crafted I was able to get payroll

835
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:40,549
information i was able to get a lot of

836
00:36:40,549 --> 00:36:41,990
internal information about the company

837
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:44,210
just because people thought I worked

838
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:46,540
there

839
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:55,830
yeah I've more stories yeah question

840
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:05,170
so I also had another slide on genders

841
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:07,060
and I get this question all the time

842
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,560
every time I do a social engineering

843
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,350
presentation I I get a question so it's

844
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:13,420
because you're female isn't it and the

845
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:18,000
answer is no so both genders have their

846
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:23,350
their benefits and some syrup to to give

847
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:26,620
some examples I did some studying and i

848
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,810
found that females were terrible at

849
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:31,270
posing in authority of positions in

850
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:35,020
higher positions like managers ceos and

851
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,180
technical positions so any time I tried

852
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,650
to pose as someone that knew what she

853
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:40,720
was talking about technically or someone

854
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:45,340
that was trying to give authorities

855
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:48,250
sorry that I was in authority position

856
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:50,140
and tell other people what to do that

857
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:52,480
did not work out well so so males have

858
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,520
the advantage in this case and also on

859
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,460
physical social engineering engagements

860
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:59,890
females couldn't dress up as like

861
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:02,170
engineers or auditors or people that

862
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:04,720
came in to fix something or take the

863
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,550
garbage disposal away males have the

864
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:09,700
advantage here as well so it's utilizing

865
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,590
your gender and the benefits that come

866
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,960
along with those both genders have their

867
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,330
yeah positives and negatives I would

868
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:19,570
agree with that I just with a change in

869
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:21,370
the tone of my voice can affect the way

870
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:26,020
that people are listening and it's it's

871
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,280
very effective over the phone whenever

872
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,640
you are pretending to be a manager from

873
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,530
the IT department you're asking someone

874
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:36,150
to help get their system up to date and

875
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:38,740
install a patch on it and they're their

876
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:41,670
systems the only one that's that's not

877
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:45,060
up to date in their department and

878
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:47,050
getting them to go to a website that

879
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:48,430
looks like it belongs the organization

880
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:51,430
that has fake green progress bar saying

881
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:53,260
has this patch has this patch has this

882
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,850
patch and then a red one that says oh

883
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:56,140
you're missing this one just click

884
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,640
download and put that on there and then

885
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,490
we'll get you a compliant I've even had

886
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:06,100
members of the organization say well is

887
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,239
this legit

888
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:12,889
and basically using some of their a they

889
00:39:12,889 --> 00:39:14,149
would then go on to tell me that they

890
00:39:14,149 --> 00:39:15,289
recently went through security awareness

891
00:39:15,289 --> 00:39:18,949
training and I kind of use that against

892
00:39:18,949 --> 00:39:20,629
the organization even instead well yeah

893
00:39:20,629 --> 00:39:23,149
we were following up with not only

894
00:39:23,149 --> 00:39:24,409
making sure you did the security where

895
00:39:24,409 --> 00:39:25,309
nurse training but also that your

896
00:39:25,309 --> 00:39:28,059
computer has all the patches installed

897
00:39:28,059 --> 00:39:31,009
we can't get the automated deployment to

898
00:39:31,009 --> 00:39:35,149
deploy but I'm feeling kind of ill today

899
00:39:35,149 --> 00:39:36,769
I didn't have to come by your desk and

900
00:39:36,769 --> 00:39:39,319
now and get you sick as well so if you

901
00:39:39,319 --> 00:39:43,129
could just do this over the over the the

902
00:39:43,129 --> 00:39:45,199
web app that we set up for it would be

903
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:47,569
save a lot of time and then they just

904
00:39:47,569 --> 00:39:54,079
want to be helpful so I wanted to show

905
00:39:54,079 --> 00:40:00,739
you what i have found to be yeah so I'm

906
00:40:00,739 --> 00:40:05,319
sorry for the text blob some of the

907
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:07,759
these like that kind of top 12 things

908
00:40:07,759 --> 00:40:10,159
that I found that work well and would

909
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:11,689
really put a hampering on what we do

910
00:40:11,689 --> 00:40:12,799
when we're performing these social

911
00:40:12,799 --> 00:40:13,999
engineering assessments and I'll walk

912
00:40:13,999 --> 00:40:15,109
through these and explain what we mean

913
00:40:15,109 --> 00:40:18,139
an alias for reporting incidents this is

914
00:40:18,139 --> 00:40:23,689
goes back to making it easy to four

915
00:40:23,689 --> 00:40:25,399
members of the organization having like

916
00:40:25,399 --> 00:40:29,899
stranger danger at example.com so that

917
00:40:29,899 --> 00:40:31,219
whenever someone thinks they got a

918
00:40:31,219 --> 00:40:32,299
phishing email they can just forward it

919
00:40:32,299 --> 00:40:33,859
to stranger danger and there's someone

920
00:40:33,859 --> 00:40:35,239
on the other end in the security team

921
00:40:35,239 --> 00:40:38,239
that's ready to review and respond to

922
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:39,739
them and say maybe even automated

923
00:40:39,739 --> 00:40:41,059
message like we are currently looking at

924
00:40:41,059 --> 00:40:43,999
this and we were planning on letting you

925
00:40:43,999 --> 00:40:45,169
know as soon as possible what the next

926
00:40:45,169 --> 00:40:50,989
steps are implementing since 2006

927
00:40:50,989 --> 00:40:52,999
there's there's been some things that

928
00:40:52,999 --> 00:40:56,239
prevent email spoofing right now from

929
00:40:56,239 --> 00:40:57,529
our research ninety-nine point nine

930
00:40:57,529 --> 00:40:59,659
percent of the lexa top 1 million allow

931
00:40:59,659 --> 00:41:01,129
email spoofing and that means we can

932
00:41:01,129 --> 00:41:04,459
send likely an email from the CEO of

933
00:41:04,459 --> 00:41:06,739
your organization to any member of your

934
00:41:06,739 --> 00:41:08,629
organization and it would appear in

935
00:41:08,629 --> 00:41:11,629
their inbox just as that person and

936
00:41:11,629 --> 00:41:15,129
asking them to do whatever we want and

937
00:41:15,129 --> 00:41:18,349
there are things like SPF that a lot of

938
00:41:18,349 --> 00:41:19,639
organizations have in place and the

939
00:41:19,639 --> 00:41:21,470
stands for sender policy framework but

940
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:25,520
it actually is it doesn't work unless

941
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,470
you also have D command D mark and that

942
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:28,790
we found that a lot of organizations

943
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:29,990
don't know that they think that they've

944
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:31,430
set up the sender policy framework which

945
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:33,650
is a white list of IP addresses or

946
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:34,760
domains that are allowed to send an

947
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,160
email from your organization but it

948
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,680
doesn't work without some of the signing

949
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,540
and crypto components that are in D

950
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,220
command D mark that almost no one has

951
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:47,869
implemented and therefore it still is

952
00:41:47,869 --> 00:41:49,099
possible to spoof email from most

953
00:41:49,099 --> 00:41:51,560
organizations this one's probably a

954
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,550
little bit overkill for most

955
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:53,660
organizations but maybe you're a

956
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:54,740
military organization or a

957
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:56,650
law-enforcement organization and

958
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:59,650
removing the HTML from your email

959
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:02,030
automatically takes away a lot of tricks

960
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:04,910
an attacker can use up their sleeve that

961
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:08,000
involve spoofing links hiding links

962
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,990
hiding information in an email or making

963
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:14,060
it look like it's got the letterhead of

964
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:17,840
your organization and it really

965
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,240
eliminates a lot of tricks that we use

966
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,270
in our email spoofing I'll stay in

967
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:24,830
boxing the the browser or the email

968
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:27,980
client can also help sandboxie is one

969
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:30,140
that actually every person that uses a

970
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:32,690
Windows machine at our organization also

971
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:36,020
utilizes that basically forces all

972
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,910
changes that are made to the system from

973
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:39,710
anything that's running on the sandbox

974
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:41,960
to be done on a copy of that on the file

975
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,580
system or any like registry changes that

976
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:46,970
something may make that may be

977
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:49,790
downloaded in your browser or any file

978
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:50,930
system changes that actually made to a

979
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:53,089
copy of that file that you can clean up

980
00:42:53,089 --> 00:42:54,710
and throw away if it was something

981
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:56,450
malicious or something that caused

982
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:59,570
damage browser plug-ins one of the

983
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:01,670
organization's we not want I've multiple

984
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:03,109
that we've targeted have been using

985
00:43:03,109 --> 00:43:05,000
things that actually harm mature enough

986
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,010
that they have all their customer

987
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:09,380
service representatives on mac mini's

988
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:14,119
running chrome with no script and other

989
00:43:14,119 --> 00:43:16,869
other security extensions that are

990
00:43:16,869 --> 00:43:19,099
really making it more difficult for us

991
00:43:19,099 --> 00:43:21,440
to compromise a member of their their

992
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,690
csr team with social engineering tactics

993
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:29,060
having an organization wide web proxy

994
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:32,599
that tracks every URL that was visited

995
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:35,010
is instrumental in instant

996
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:37,230
response we're going to weave a

997
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:39,600
financial institution that we had

998
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,190
repeatedly year after year compromise

999
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:42,450
with social engineering got a little bit

1000
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:44,730
wise to actually being able to implement

1001
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:46,230
in their incident response plan to go

1002
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:49,620
into websites and look at once they had

1003
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:52,110
the incident reported we maybe we

1004
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:54,030
registered a fake website or flight

1005
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:56,070
domain and then once that was reported

1006
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:59,760
they were to go see every user name and

1007
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,400
work station ID that visited that URL

1008
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,440
and then treat that as now part of the

1009
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,090
incident response and they called us up

1010
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:09,450
and they said was uh was this email with

1011
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:11,130
this don't link to this domain you guys

1012
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:15,270
yep did you in fact Jessica so-and-so's

1013
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:19,710
computer only yep all right okay we feel

1014
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:23,520
we feel better this year we found it and

1015
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,950
it was because they had that

1016
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:26,910
organization wide web proxy although

1017
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:27,870
users were going through and they could

1018
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:30,420
track down the every user that click the

1019
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:33,300
link and then go and reimage their

1020
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,190
machine and force them to change their

1021
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:41,130
password even they also started setting

1022
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:42,380
up things where they would alert on

1023
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,700
domain names that contain their

1024
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,640
organization's name in the domain and

1025
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:50,270
they actually thought that it was us

1026
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:51,870
registering some but it was actually

1027
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:53,400
another part of the organization that

1028
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,690
they weren't aware of registering some

1029
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:59,340
new domains and Rob fuller moob Ock's

1030
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:02,400
actually talks about like these attacker

1031
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,760
ghost stories and one that he he shared

1032
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,930
was not only taking the list of all the

1033
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:11,270
domains that you know that may be

1034
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:14,510
variations or typos of your domain or

1035
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:17,670
replacing the letter o with 0 and things

1036
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:19,590
along those lines taking that list and

1037
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:21,060
even don't even necessarily have to

1038
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:22,800
alert on or register all those domains

1039
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,970
although if you have the resources you

1040
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:26,400
might as well but you can put them in

1041
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:30,870
internal dns entries and then have your

1042
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:34,170
internal users go to a site that says

1043
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:36,090
hey this was probably a phishing attack

1044
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:39,300
or you made a typo because we don't have

1045
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:43,380
a zero in our domain name please report

1046
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:44,670
this incident if you received an email

1047
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:49,130
that coerced you into going to this link

1048
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:52,370
customization of authentication

1049
00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:54,200
processes this is something maybe your

1050
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,400
bank does where they make you pick a

1051
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,950
picture to recognize when you're logging

1052
00:45:57,950 --> 00:46:00,140
in can help prevent social engineering

1053
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:02,330
as well or fishing basically if the

1054
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:04,280
attacker has does not have a piece of

1055
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,280
information it's almost in that sense a

1056
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,420
element of two factor authentication

1057
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:09,890
it's something that they don't know but

1058
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:11,900
you do you pick the picture of the race

1059
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:13,970
car when you're logging into your bank

1060
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:15,350
and if you don't see that there then

1061
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:18,460
it's not really your bank's website

1062
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:21,950
application whitelisting would be having

1063
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:23,750
a list of all the approved apps that a

1064
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:25,250
customer service representatives machine

1065
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:28,970
needs to run and if you see anything

1066
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:33,490
else pop up that's bad news bears and

1067
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:35,930
some of the basic defense in depth

1068
00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:36,890
techniques that we're talking about

1069
00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:38,540
earlier today encrypting data in transit

1070
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:43,220
and at rest to mitigate the risk of an

1071
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:44,540
already compromised machine or a

1072
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:47,120
compromised application from pilfering

1073
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:51,650
other sensitive data one of the

1074
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:52,970
financial organizations we work with a

1075
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:55,400
and force that whenever their users take

1076
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,740
their laptop home they can't connect to

1077
00:46:57,740 --> 00:47:00,110
the internet without going through the

1078
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:01,880
corporate VPN and then they can still do

1079
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:04,280
the things like monitor the web traffic

1080
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:08,510
through a web since the proxy and make

1081
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:11,570
sure that they are kind of overseeing

1082
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:13,550
what what websites that go to on a

1083
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:18,710
corporate issued laptop and basically

1084
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:20,810
performing regular social engineering

1085
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:23,720
assessments for the purpose of training

1086
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:26,390
the incident response team more so than

1087
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:28,430
training the users I always ask whenever

1088
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:30,440
we start out on scoping for a social

1089
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,880
engineer engagement is your motivation

1090
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:35,270
to for this to get a better idea of

1091
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:37,130
security awareness levels at your

1092
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:39,830
organization or is it to get an idea of

1093
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:41,720
how well you'd send responses for social

1094
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:43,790
engineering and often they say both but

1095
00:47:43,790 --> 00:47:45,590
I think a trend towards spending more

1096
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:47,090
time training the incident response team

1097
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:48,620
than trying to Train everyone in the

1098
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:49,820
sales marketing or recruiting

1099
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:53,290
departments who can caneel a lot better

1100
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:56,860
return on investment

1101
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:01,440
time

1102
00:48:22,919 --> 00:48:24,759
yeah sorry I didn't mean to knock

1103
00:48:24,759 --> 00:48:27,309
posters too much I just I do think

1104
00:48:27,309 --> 00:48:29,199
there's value in security awareness

1105
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:31,299
training I think gamification and I

1106
00:48:31,299 --> 00:48:32,619
think you may have some comments on this

1107
00:48:32,619 --> 00:48:35,679
is a great way to make it rewarding and

1108
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:37,689
make it somewhat competitive even maybe

1109
00:48:37,689 --> 00:48:40,569
between co-workers to be the best at

1110
00:48:40,569 --> 00:48:42,549
reporting social engineering incidents

1111
00:48:42,549 --> 00:48:48,429
and I think that depending on that it's

1112
00:48:48,429 --> 00:48:49,599
really got any custom the

1113
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:51,279
recommendations but depending on your

1114
00:48:51,279 --> 00:48:52,179
organization if you're an organization

1115
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:54,219
has a very small security team and very

1116
00:48:54,219 --> 00:48:57,069
limited finite budget you may want to

1117
00:48:57,069 --> 00:48:58,959
only do the minimum amount of training

1118
00:48:58,959 --> 00:49:03,669
that's required for compliance she may

1119
00:49:03,669 --> 00:49:05,679
have a different opinion all right great

1120
00:49:05,679 --> 00:49:07,329
this talk was not meant to sound like

1121
00:49:07,329 --> 00:49:08,679
you should forget about the human aspect

1122
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:10,150
absolutely you should still consider

1123
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:12,789
training humans but there's also

1124
00:49:12,789 --> 00:49:14,289
technological controls that you need to

1125
00:49:14,289 --> 00:49:15,999
consider you cannot rely on a human

1126
00:49:15,999 --> 00:49:18,789
because like I said three lated we fall

1127
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:21,549
victim to psychological attacks and

1128
00:49:21,549 --> 00:49:23,650
again gamifying security awareness

1129
00:49:23,650 --> 00:49:25,479
training try to make it fun don't make

1130
00:49:25,479 --> 00:49:27,069
it a paranoid culture don't make people

1131
00:49:27,069 --> 00:49:29,289
bored of like reading your e-learning

1132
00:49:29,289 --> 00:49:32,349
module with this clip art and tick boxes

1133
00:49:32,349 --> 00:49:34,119
you need to make it fun you need to make

1134
00:49:34,119 --> 00:49:35,799
it engaging you need to make the end

1135
00:49:35,799 --> 00:49:38,140
user want to do this training or at

1136
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:39,969
least not hate doing the training yeah

1137
00:49:39,969 --> 00:49:41,349
it's going to say as pen testers we're

1138
00:49:41,349 --> 00:49:43,089
often required to still do the the

1139
00:49:43,089 --> 00:49:44,529
training before we're allowed to use

1140
00:49:44,529 --> 00:49:46,630
that internal domain account and oh man

1141
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:48,429
have seen some really bad ones ones that

1142
00:49:48,429 --> 00:49:49,900
I can just keep cooking the multiple

1143
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:51,159
choice until lets me through or just

1144
00:49:51,159 --> 00:49:54,039
like disassemble the flash and go to the

1145
00:49:54,039 --> 00:49:55,539
end link that says yep you completed it

1146
00:49:55,539 --> 00:49:58,900
here's your certificate but it my

1147
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:03,309
training so we can do better than that

1148
00:50:03,309 --> 00:50:04,509
if you are going to be training at least

1149
00:50:04,509 --> 00:50:06,789
make sure that you're measuring the

1150
00:50:06,789 --> 00:50:07,689
effectiveness of it a lot of

1151
00:50:07,689 --> 00:50:08,859
organizations I've asked them was like

1152
00:50:08,859 --> 00:50:10,749
what how are you measuring the

1153
00:50:10,749 --> 00:50:13,299
effectiveness of your training and like

1154
00:50:13,299 --> 00:50:17,739
huh we just do it I just remembered

1155
00:50:17,739 --> 00:50:20,140
something very interesting that someone

1156
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:21,669
said to me last time I presented on this

1157
00:50:21,669 --> 00:50:23,979
topic and that is when you get a

1158
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:25,719
phishing email or went all sorry when

1159
00:50:25,719 --> 00:50:28,390
you get an email or a phone call that

1160
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:31,059
makes you want to react in some sort of

1161
00:50:31,059 --> 00:50:33,509
psychological way like something that is

1162
00:50:33,509 --> 00:50:35,709
creating a sense of urgency something

1163
00:50:35,709 --> 00:50:36,190
that is a

1164
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:39,490
to your desires just stop and think for

1165
00:50:39,490 --> 00:50:41,980
a second saying why does this person

1166
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:45,180
need this information from you right now

1167
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:48,310
what emotions is appealing to me so if

1168
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:52,150
it seems fishy at all think about what

1169
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:54,160
the email is asking or what the person

1170
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:57,280
over the phone is asking from you in a

1171
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,819
psychological sense so I hope that makes

1172
00:51:00,819 --> 00:51:08,260
sense yep we didn't sleep last night

1173
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:12,089
sleep dinner was good

1174
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:25,570
we have a hundred percent success rate

1175
00:51:25,570 --> 00:51:28,630
of at least getting one person to fall

1176
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:31,480
victim to our campaigns and one is all

1177
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:34,810
we need and it's really kind of it's

1178
00:51:34,810 --> 00:51:36,220
rough to be on the other side of that be

1179
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:37,750
on the defensive side and say like I

1180
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:41,470
have this Hydra of attacks like coming

1181
00:51:41,470 --> 00:51:43,930
at my organization and I like can cut

1182
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:46,060
off one head but that the six other ones

1183
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:52,300
still got me but I really would like to

1184
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:55,660
see it treated as a finite resource

1185
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:58,000
problem say okay I have X amount of

1186
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,350
people I have X amount of dollars in my

1187
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:00,670
budget here's what I'm going to do with

1188
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:03,160
it here's my priorities and here's i'm

1189
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:04,750
going to mature my organization security

1190
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:06,160
so i can sleep better at night as a

1191
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:09,160
defender and say that I got my

1192
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:11,350
organization this this year to implement

1193
00:52:11,350 --> 00:52:14,860
spfd Kim and demark properly so now at

1194
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:16,240
least attackers can't spoof email from

1195
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:19,690
our organization and that's their

1196
00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:21,010
progress and then they can show that to

1197
00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:23,050
their management and say we did good

1198
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:25,890
we're making progress

1199
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:41,759
we did

1200
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:46,500
sure um and and it really is it's kind

1201
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:47,760
of funny because we work with a lot of

1202
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:48,990
different industries we work with a lot

1203
00:52:48,990 --> 00:52:50,940
of different sizes of organizations from

1204
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:54,960
fortune 100 to startups and really have

1205
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,690
to be cognizant of this above you're

1206
00:52:57,690 --> 00:52:59,130
gonna be able to do here and now and

1207
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:03,980
here's what we should we should hire you

1208
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:07,890
know for these these guys did you forget

1209
00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:10,970
we have one more celeb

1210
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:15,880
yeah I think

1211
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:17,740
we're seeing a lot of organizations

1212
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:20,049
actually want to outsource their there I

1213
00:53:20,049 --> 00:53:23,170
are there is a response even to us and

1214
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:25,450
lungs like we at a decline because we

1215
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:28,150
all have the expertise in-house to take

1216
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:31,450
I think I trend we're seeing is just a

1217
00:53:31,450 --> 00:53:33,069
outsourcing get some of its an expert in

1218
00:53:33,069 --> 00:53:35,000
into their response and

1219
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,820
out of the organization I one more

1220
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:41,330
really cool side of the show that

1221
00:53:41,330 --> 00:53:43,840
question I could

1222
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:08,690
yeah I

1223
00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:11,000
someone earlier reading this book on how

1224
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,369
to lie with statistics it's a very old

1225
00:54:13,369 --> 00:54:15,140
book like from the written my twenties

1226
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:17,290
or thirties

1227
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:21,390
maybe it's a product of it actually is

1228
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:23,520
the attitude the organization is really

1229
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,950
helping me for the better amazed pitched

1230
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:28,070
in the presentations to management but

1231
00:54:28,070 --> 00:54:30,750
the organizations that I see that are

1232
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:31,740
tracking their Incident Response

1233
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:36,800
successes they feel much better please

1234
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:40,070
they're still getting compromised

1235
00:54:40,070 --> 00:54:42,510
remediation they're able to do a lot

1236
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:44,070
better analytics on what should we

1237
00:54:44,070 --> 00:54:47,400
change what technical controls may help

1238
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:50,340
what policies may help what processes

1239
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:54,390
are broken what are our people's

1240
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:58,109
attitudes when it comes to we had an

1241
00:54:58,109 --> 00:55:00,830
incident to sit down to talk about it

1242
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:04,109
and kind of generally treating that as a

1243
00:55:04,109 --> 00:55:05,609
team effort that we're going to help

1244
00:55:05,609 --> 00:55:08,130
solve down and change some things to

1245
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:09,640
prevent that

1246
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:14,140
and keep getting more people in the

1247
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:15,640
sales department this quarter that are

1248
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:18,130
clicking efficiently that's not really

1249
00:55:18,130 --> 00:55:21,160
knowing them much other than sales

1250
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:25,390
people I don't see your question before

1251
00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:27,309
about having listened to the hiring

1252
00:55:27,309 --> 00:55:29,460
process

1253
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:33,869
to have but the reality is or what I've

1254
00:55:33,869 --> 00:55:36,180
seen a lot

1255
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:39,340
is when when a new person comes on board

1256
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:41,260
the corporation's they have a huge

1257
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:43,150
onboarding process they have heaps of

1258
00:55:43,150 --> 00:55:44,590
security modules they have heaps of

1259
00:55:44,590 --> 00:55:45,240
training

1260
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:49,279
about how to write reports or powder

1261
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:54,720
comes this huge confronting list

1262
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,140
of the stuff that mean

1263
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:59,490
to do and serious

1264
00:55:59,559 --> 00:56:01,989
I guess that they're not engage unless

1265
00:56:01,989 --> 00:56:04,369
they don't

1266
00:56:04,369 --> 00:56:05,960
that security training so it's difficult

1267
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,140
balance

1268
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:09,920
strike

1269
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:11,760
training the use of people they into the

1270
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,990
organization and

1271
00:56:13,990 --> 00:56:17,399
also very very fluid

1272
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:26,110
yeah the attitudes of fire people just

1273
00:56:26,110 --> 00:56:28,030
need you to have to train the new people

1274
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:31,800
all over again from the start so

1275
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,010
we have like a really cool it's very

1276
00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:38,430
penguins you know getting a cold

1277
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:41,100
because your imagination

1278
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:45,900
any requests ? oh yeah

1279
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:50,430
big numbers

1280
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:54,560
how often you get people to go hey you

1281
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:57,130
don't work

1282
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:01,940
not often enough

1283
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:05,100
all

1284
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:09,078
they say hey your number is up around

1285
00:57:10,299 --> 00:57:11,829
or hey we don't have an AR people

1286
00:57:11,829 --> 00:57:14,319
working at our organization so it does

1287
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:17,699
happen and that's

1288
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:21,950
because we like to report on

1289
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:25,790
yeah that's happened

1290
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:31,189
that's one over here

1291
00:57:32,010 --> 00:57:34,810
sure in the back

1292
00:57:34,810 --> 00:57:37,290
why

1293
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:40,660
Oh

1294
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:45,470
gamification

1295
00:57:45,470 --> 00:57:48,470
game

1296
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:52,819
they're like

1297
00:57:55,610 --> 00:57:57,630
yeah know your audience and

1298
00:57:57,630 --> 00:58:00,750
it's really important for writing any

1299
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:03,450
whether you're pitching to the Executive

1300
00:58:03,450 --> 00:58:05,549
Board on your social learning results or

1301
00:58:05,549 --> 00:58:07,529
you're pitching to the technical folks

1302
00:58:07,529 --> 00:58:09,990
or just the general culture the

1303
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:12,599
organizations and yeah it's just tailing

1304
00:58:12,599 --> 00:58:15,380
you training too

1305
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:18,220
the people like that

1306
00:58:18,650 --> 00:58:20,710
you
