1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:04,049
all right everybody you ever seen it

2
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:06,540
down picture Muslim because bizarre I'm

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,809
here to introduce modern exotoxins we

4
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:11,700
have chef Donna can we talk about dead

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,400
off material they've opportunity as

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,900
sugar plum honey he is the director of

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,750
poker engagement at a secure code

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,850
analysis and probably more like that

9
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,910
company with over ten years

10
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,060
o trip epic like to share experience as

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,640
those a developerworks and a moment

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,219
leader get a lot of really great

13
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:36,899
backgrounds committee guy a third time

14
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:38,879
any kind of not always something

15
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,070
interesting to get rid of any hope that

16
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,590
you pay attention so I'm going to hand

17
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,600
it over to Pete now we did not on there

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,590
thanks

19
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,840
you're on

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,940
all right so it is a brand new top

21
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,420
solution all have the time set up yet on

22
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,670
this my time all right

23
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,210
I love it about me while the been doing

24
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,280
this 25 years to software developer so I

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,040
come to information security advocating

26
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,200
from a developer practitioner point of

27
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,150
view but obviously working at nothing

28
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,619
like Darko a ton of a spec experience so

29
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:18,890
if n is very code almost 11 years now

30
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:21,930
working the agile working waterfall

31
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,540
working DevOps I've moved my company

32
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,780
America from waterfall through anvil to

33
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,939
secure DevOps from a monolithic

34
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:31,770
applications one micro service based

35
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,900
application excuse me

36
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,369
and I've been sold with so the biggest

37
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:36,900
company the world about pulling on a

38
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,930
good app set program sometimes about

39
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,790
they are DevOps and agile practices

40
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,100
themselves and if you everyone get my

41
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,520
attention vitamins and whiskey that's

42
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,899
their job

43
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:51,570
all right so it could set the stage in

44
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,899
addition we use that one DHS a 90% all

45
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:56,670
the attacks that we've seen the breaches

46
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:57,780
have something to do with the

47
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,060
application layer as not necessarily

48
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,520
applications that we build and sometimes

49
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,259
data issues we Bible we should think

50
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:05,579
about the security of all of the

51
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:07,290
applications that were running an

52
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,508
article Erica Scott

53
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:11,038
also the biggest cognise people

54
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,709
customers it were prospects actually

55
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:15,500
who's a vertical customer here

56
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:20,010
thank you everyone else appalling ah the

57
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,510
big thing I did got to see is they say

58
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,799
hey we're just going to do our Tier one

59
00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:25,250
applications our most important ones

60
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,909
okay great

61
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:28,769
and now that's kind of like the national

62
00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:30,750
line of security at one layer with that

63
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,530
term

64
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,260
so yeah World War two French Dumba's

65
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,269
well the Germans out but they didn't go

66
00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:38,250
all the way so they just program along

67
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,799
really this is the way aspect is

68
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:42,090
typically about well just to be

69
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,010
important watch so you see things like

70
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,750
Target which I'm not going to do at

71
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,530
target.com

72
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,170
or anything like that was some HVAC

73
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,480
contractors building site even target

74
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,560
and that's how they got into their

75
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,920
courts or some charity event JP Morgan

76
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,060
Chase middle for a running event in our

77
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,400
open source community - so I'm not

78
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,109
saving open sources worst of the first

79
00:03:04,109 --> 00:03:05,909
part it's about the same it's just we

80
00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:08,370
don't think about it very much alright

81
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,109
so who has enough piece of speech

82
00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:11,930
program today

83
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:17,579
alright one so just you're outside

84
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:27,450
program right now right or this right in

85
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,190
there's a couple of different outcomes

86
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:33,150
so that each you saw previously a lot of

87
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,480
times I see this they come to you at the

88
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,699
end or their security attestation they

89
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:40,739
say here's my release candidate and you

90
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:43,079
go yeah on a bunch of stuff you're going

91
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:45,209
to these go fix and then they start to

92
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:47,280
phone calls up the chain all the way

93
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,930
through some of the powerful not to call

94
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,639
you and say hey we're releasing this

95
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:53,129
anyway I'm sorry I didn't see that

96
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:53,669
before

97
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:56,280
or if you've got a real Gator this is

98
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,500
really cool if you can get this most

99
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,269
companies can't this is what happens

100
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:06,329
ramming speed or ludicrous speed they

101
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,859
crash right into the gate they don't

102
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:09,540
think about they hope that they can get

103
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,349
through it by the time they're changing

104
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:14,730
around the way applications are

105
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,228
developed and this is why I'm here

106
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:18,630
giving this talk at to a bunch of

107
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,079
security practitioners meaning to think

108
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:23,210
ready about how we approach our

109
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,009
application teams and our development

110
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:28,400
teams how they build software so that it

111
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,490
can be secure if you look at the release

112
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,530
timelines that we're seeing and these

113
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:36,319
are ballpark averages typical what we

114
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:39,800
will see waterfall you're looking at one

115
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,319
to four releases a year and he's doing

116
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:44,210
waterfall here in their shop or knows as

117
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:47,180
a different one one couple rocking back

118
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:47,960
and forth

119
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,310
uh big scenes I was on teams of 150

120
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,539
people sometimes more than on earth

121
00:04:53,539 --> 00:04:56,060
before building projects right there's

122
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,789
huge efforts move to add and now we're

123
00:04:58,789 --> 00:05:00,979
shrinking that fine line and we're

124
00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:02,449
tripping the team size and this is

125
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:05,690
really changing the way they adjust for

126
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,879
these teams and awaiting pregnant

127
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:10,099
a couple releases a month now we're

128
00:05:10,099 --> 00:05:14,030
talking about in in sizes 6 to 12 by the

129
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:16,460
way you're going to see a Dakota lodging

130
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,440
down so these aren't these are crude

131
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,110
related things usually using agile

132
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,240
methodology to run your DevOps

133
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,509
operations alright to deadlock now we're

134
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:28,279
talking about hundreds of releases a

135
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:32,060
year or more sometimes ten fifteen

136
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,050
hundred times a day

137
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:35,960
any not workshop you're working in this

138
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,630
ABC in size again decrees are typically

139
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,520
running that agile methodology on top of

140
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,849
that all right so how do we get here so

141
00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:45,919
that in a day when we have waterfall

142
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,870
right we have these walls between

143
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,819
everybody and I'm going to skip security

144
00:05:49,819 --> 00:05:51,979
over here quality because I think of

145
00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:55,580
security as equal to quality we would

146
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,979
hand off over the wall right development

147
00:05:57,979 --> 00:06:00,440
done passed on quality all genomic

148
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,979
that's one operations etc and the

149
00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:05,870
problem with that is once we've written

150
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:08,389
our specifications and have a plan for

151
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:11,210
our product owners we lose the fidelity

152
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:15,099
of bother down a lot of plain telephone

153
00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:17,479
similarly our developers are building

154
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:20,210
these applications and why they help

155
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,590
them that way and the decisions they

156
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,020
made and how they expect it to run is

157
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,419
also losses you can follow down towards

158
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:29,139
our production environments similarly

159
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:32,180
upstream feedback from our operations

160
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,390
people they know how

161
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:41,600
here's an Operations sorry they know

162
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,790
Howard run they have scripts to go it's

163
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,560
the thing is that we didn't do right oh

164
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,480
I gotta knock this process over every

165
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,430
couple of days because it runs out of

166
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,260
memory otherwise all those stupid things

167
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,580
but those don't make it far enough

168
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,900
upstream for us to do eating goodbyes so

169
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,850
hence we move to agile let's not done

170
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,260
some of these well typically the first

171
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,330
wall to break down you'll stick your

172
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,580
product owner your developers and your

173
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,260
quality people on the same team and

174
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,920
that's awesome so now we've got some

175
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,890
really good fidelity around our business

176
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:16,540
intent and application knowledge but a

177
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:19,250
little while still there you still think

178
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,870
it's somebody else's problem to operate

179
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,790
our software so that app screen

180
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:25,420
information is still getting lost

181
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,610
who the deadlines are in deadlocks

182
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,640
we have really really good continuity

183
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:35,390
across the spectrum the operations

184
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,430
people are in the room talking to the

185
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,840
developers about how the software

186
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,820
actually works listening to the business

187
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:44,120
problem is being solved so everyone has

188
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,640
good information about how it's supposed

189
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,960
to work at what are you supposed to do

190
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,460
or would technology point of view and

191
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:55,880
isn't London driven by the timelines if

192
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,010
you're talking about waterfall if I have

193
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,540
to do something once a year or twice a

194
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,210
year it doesn't matter how much it hurts

195
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,520
I'll just do it that way every time

196
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,010
there's no hanging on a benefit to me to

197
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:09,860
go automate that process but when we get

198
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,450
into agile we start talking about

199
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,700
something that was months to a year and

200
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,430
we're now moving that down to you know a

201
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,470
month or two weeks

202
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:21,350
I need repeatable processes that your

203
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,870
run when I need to matter whether

204
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,910
somebody sitting in a particular sleep

205
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:28,700
with the engine keyboard or not once we

206
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,020
get to DevOps and we're trying to

207
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,809
release investments on you know I make

208
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:36,500
everything absolutely everything all

209
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,099
right loose amilia with added a lot much

210
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:43,390
you require a little action quick primer

211
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,100
over here we have a product on the guy

212
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,779
with a light bulb or gala the lightbulb

213
00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:49,930
is under a 3-wood stall the backlog this

214
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:52,300
that body of a prioritized order the

215
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,950
list of all the stuff that they want us

216
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,579
to do okey okay and what we're going to

217
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:58,839
do with that is we're going to take that

218
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:00,640
into a plan session easily a routing

219
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,990
section first we're going to look at

220
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:04,089
this time say you understand what being

221
00:09:04,089 --> 00:09:06,970
asked for really important part of this

222
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:10,810
process so let's say my scrum team is

223
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:13,329
down here in this first row where the

224
00:09:13,329 --> 00:09:14,620
product owners going to describe the

225
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,540
feature at the 8th is what I need and

226
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,310
we're into something called planing

227
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:21,519
focus this is a docking mission sequence

228
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,800
of numbers from 0 it's already gotten to

229
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:29,320
Wanda at a 1 to 2 everybody 13 etc it's

230
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:34,110
relative sizing so 2 places 31 excetera

231
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,310
so we're going to we're going to sit on

232
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,920
three show me your car actually this

233
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,000
will surprise you can do it on your

234
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,800
phone once more fumble cars so we're

235
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,630
going to show the numbers in I get a 1

236
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,940
for this guy over here I had a 13 year

237
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,820
at 0 there 20 over there my Bo we really

238
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,890
don't understand this Oh point of that

239
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,510
exercise to get it down to the point

240
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,670
where everybody else can because you

241
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,890
might not be just one person's job to go

242
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,600
do this we're not signing at work right

243
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,690
now we're trying to understand to work

244
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:03,100
once we do that in our plan says I'm

245
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,320
going to come in as a team so what we're

246
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,940
going to get done or whatever this is

247
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,279
printed so spring is a time box duration

248
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,670
into the four weeks to the six weeks and

249
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:15,279
we're going to talk every day and five

250
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,680
within 15 minutes what I do yesterday

251
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,360
we're going to do today what am I being

252
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,880
blocked by so we can identify our teams

253
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,070
to help each other we're going to track

254
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,190
that sometimes on the board usually

255
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:28,720
electronically I'm going to at the end

256
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,399
say an agent again everything done

257
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,829
rescue assault retrospective and I'm

258
00:10:32,829 --> 00:10:34,630
going to say what well what did you go

259
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,579
well I want you to change to be better

260
00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:38,649
at continuous improvement process that's

261
00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:41,560
built into that not typically is my

262
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:47,199
security I hear something open to it

263
00:10:47,199 --> 00:10:49,720
already and what ends up happening

264
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,699
especially in those previous cases

265
00:10:51,699 --> 00:10:54,040
they're fighting for budget right they

266
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,400
come to us or at least get

267
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,410
say here's other things you need to go

268
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:00,980
do well and just do the most important

269
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,740
ones which ones are those yeah that's

270
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,089
like a mule is the barometer you

271
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:05,720
tomorrow

272
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,300
well we just did the pop pop so you're

273
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,740
fighting for that budget at the end one

274
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,120
is saluting our worst possible scenario

275
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,029
they're ready to go out the door all

276
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:15,440
right so let's the personnel you

277
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,720
know what DevOps actually is for my

278
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,110
perspective is both maybe Harvey a chef

279
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:24,080
I love this quote it is an

280
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,720
organizational life change it's how you

281
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,160
run a high velocity organization I need

282
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,110
to change everything if I'm releasing

283
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:36,890
features daily if you might support

284
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:38,180
people need to get trained differently

285
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,610
if you might documentation people need

286
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,140
to work at a different pace or work

287
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,270
differently my product owner certainly

288
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,980
needs to be filling a few faster than

289
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,110
these needs to because about blocking up

290
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,000
this functionality you have to change

291
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,710
the way you think about this end by the

292
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,200
way we can't lighten up the releases

293
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,880
from the security plan view everything

294
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,010
can't be contested that little doesn't

295
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:58,850
exist anymore

296
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:01,400
I'm sorry sorry to say that it's still

297
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,890
valuable I'll show you where I think it

298
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,839
should go but we can't do that for

299
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,390
everything anymore so is it a little bit

300
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:12,050
off cycle and everything from when I

301
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:14,000
found the idea of planning all the way

302
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,820
up and monitoring and production now I

303
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,800
fear once people talk about the DevOps

304
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,700
team or the DevOps guy or gal this is

305
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,730
not what I think of as DevOps right so

306
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:28,970
here's what they operations people do

307
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,410
people have moved the software through

308
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:33,890
production that's not really getting

309
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:36,110
after the whole problem it has to be

310
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:39,770
this you have to have a team that is

311
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,720
responsible from cradle to grave from

312
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,029
the stuff that they built because I'll

313
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:45,650
tell you what a developer it's

314
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:47,570
differently about what they wrote Monday

315
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:50,360
have to monitor and operate when they

316
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,160
have to go write those scripts that say

317
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,230
well geez gonna knock over the servers

318
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,610
again because I'm running out of memory

319
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,350
well maybe I should calm down a little

320
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,300
bit different maybe I should go fix that

321
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:03,080
now right if I'm wearing the pager I'm

322
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,089
the one getting woken up I'm going to

323
00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:06,000
think differently about

324
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,029
maybe that I do similarly security out

325
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:14,519
from our waterfall days and from the way

326
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:16,800
these puppies typically bolt security on

327
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,939
a hand is where we end up sitting

328
00:13:19,939 --> 00:13:23,250
horrible place all the damages have been

329
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,959
done we're only just pointing it out to

330
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,930
them okay we're turning ignorant into

331
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:31,199
negligence this is what we need you have

332
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:32,939
to be there when they're planning you

333
00:13:32,939 --> 00:13:35,639
have to do things with them of them

334
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:37,319
understanding the threat actors help

335
00:13:37,319 --> 00:13:39,750
them understand the design decisions

336
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,360
that they're making so here's my

337
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,209
strategy I there were six items I kind

338
00:13:45,209 --> 00:13:46,500
of paired them together because I think

339
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,050
they logically go together first is

340
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:51,329
relationships of accountability seven

341
00:13:51,329 --> 00:13:53,550
training and remediation coaching and

342
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,980
thirdly security champions and

343
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:59,670
right-sized tested so startled

344
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,360
relationships

345
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,449
whoo all right so who's AHA security

346
00:14:03,449 --> 00:14:06,810
so who here Isabella side of the fence

347
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:13,559
one quality nobody okay noticeably

348
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:15,899
absent we are dinner operation team all

349
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:16,860
right how about people that are

350
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,290
responsible for application security so

351
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:23,040
with those teams awesome so we end up

352
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,509
appearing security or in development

353
00:14:26,509 --> 00:14:28,709
Missa pogie edges same time all right

354
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:32,040
now okay again now nothing up put your

355
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,860
hand down if you don't know someone

356
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,959
you're here in the other part of the

357
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,759
organization don't really visit the

358
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:43,290
security video organization watch end of

359
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:49,290
them we have to work together now in my

360
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:52,050
model right those people are all on the

361
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,790
same team that's not always possible

362
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:56,759
that's not always practical sometime

363
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:58,199
security has to be on the outside that

364
00:14:58,199 --> 00:14:59,759
destroyed were organized and we're just

365
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:02,160
have to deal with it okay fine but that

366
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,059
doesn't mean I can't have a relationship

367
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:05,100
with that person I have to know who they

368
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,199
are they have to be a real person with

369
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,100
real problems do you understand how the

370
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,370
gold this cut is going to come up again

371
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,589
what they both to do because you look at

372
00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:19,310
your typical developer

373
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:22,279
it's move software fast that's it

374
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:24,800
operations people are keep production

375
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,439
smooth right experienced people are

376
00:15:27,439 --> 00:15:30,939
secure the stuff whether that be your

377
00:15:30,939 --> 00:15:34,509
your boundaries for your applications

378
00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:38,420
those are all in conflict we have to

379
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,040
share the same goals they don't have the

380
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,689
same goals of you that's something

381
00:15:41,689 --> 00:15:43,370
interesting to know because when you go

382
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,629
to them to say easy to fix these things

383
00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:46,910
like know what though and it should fit

384
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:50,379
software that's all that they're about

385
00:15:50,379 --> 00:15:53,300
so understanding your struggle so we're

386
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,800
going to go in a little bit more depth

387
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,029
on this as well and do you meet with

388
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:02,389
them if you don't you should lunch once

389
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:05,689
is okay drinks whiskey whiskey buddy

390
00:16:05,689 --> 00:16:07,279
down there yes another one

391
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,610
excellent they gone for a whiskey it to

392
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:11,720
know the things that they're struggling

393
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,490
with have any ace to the role it's

394
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,470
critical to us working together they

395
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,870
usually get so one of my first companies

396
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,579
are becoming get into this conflict in

397
00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:24,709
the meeting the be teams they are the

398
00:16:24,709 --> 00:16:27,800
one pull up your business cards seem is

399
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,139
they're all the same we're all on the

400
00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:33,500
same team so it's critical that we think

401
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:37,519
that I remember them you need to be a

402
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,110
little bit more sympathetic to stop the

403
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:40,370
base for Google yes

404
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:42,110
the sequel introduction you find

405
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:44,149
cortically important you want to get

406
00:16:44,149 --> 00:17:05,539
that fixed by game finally I'm going to

407
00:17:05,539 --> 00:17:10,880
assume so excellent point by the comment

408
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,789
water table if I put a ticketed and I'm

409
00:17:13,789 --> 00:17:16,069
not seeing working on it is frustrating

410
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:18,770
but the question you need to ask is why

411
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:21,169
it's not because they don't care about

412
00:17:21,169 --> 00:17:24,079
you or what your job is is because

413
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,490
they're not hold for that Oh

414
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:34,270
and now might be too right but we button

415
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,580
so I will counter that but I can't sit

416
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,290
on the other side and just be for budget

417
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:38,830
about it

418
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,600
and you don't have conversation so X

419
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,840
avenues relationship is critical in

420
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,750
people it becomes alright accountability

421
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:50,680
I have never seen an absent program good

422
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:54,160
after remediation if there is a no

423
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,930
accountability for the people at both

424
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:58,020
the datum software in the first place

425
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:01,390
yes if I'm buying software from vendors

426
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,920
and I don't have it written in the

427
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,810
contracted by the way you gotta fix it

428
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:07,870
security stuff if you put in air or I'll

429
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:11,380
paint ownership of it an at4 it what is

430
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,340
their incentive they're just going to

431
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:15,610
kill you for that is extra work usually

432
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:17,110
you can wrap that up into the quality

433
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:19,480
love the AVP bus securities quality and

434
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,860
you might be able to get away with them

435
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:24,360
but think about that your contracts

436
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:28,480
security and development need to share

437
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,780
the goal of securing those software that

438
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:36,070
we make the company to get a lot about

439
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,540
the security team if by the way the

440
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,730
screen it makes the problem the

441
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:41,950
developers did you can also you can do

442
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:44,440
as a developer in application spirit

443
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,210
we're the ones responsible for it we

444
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,830
should take accountability for it and

445
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:48,910
you see that more and more in this

446
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,830
DevOps model as we as we look at

447
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:54,490
becoming more multi-discipline engineers

448
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:56,440
so having to worry about quality and

449
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,960
operations and by the way I've

450
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,940
containerized so I need to think about

451
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,100
IPM systems engineering that I never had

452
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,440
to think about before all of those

453
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,230
assets need to feed into that team as

454
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:13,690
requirements so best way to do this is

455
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:15,820
to change the way they paid they have

456
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,410
goals

457
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,280
everybody typically does in an

458
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,710
organization the developers having

459
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:22,630
security goals they don't I might want

460
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:25,060
to start there because you're going to

461
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,400
maybe a real bad if those measurements

462
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,960
are going to hurt there a end of the

463
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,150
year you got a measure and report it

464
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:37,330
back look at where we are and look when

465
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:40,190
you onboard a baseline your application

466
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,870
it's already you're going to find a

467
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,220
whole bunch of checkers of that up there

468
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:47,000
it surprised but that is you're not

469
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,590
going to fix you overnight we get there

470
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,000
overnight and you're not going to fix it

471
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,210
over

472
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:53,179
sometimes the software is 5 10 15 20

473
00:19:53,179 --> 00:19:54,200
years old

474
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,389
it has security vulnerabilities in them

475
00:19:56,389 --> 00:19:58,669
okay fine yes they're also in production

476
00:19:58,669 --> 00:20:01,429
traveler can we mitigate against some of

477
00:20:01,429 --> 00:20:03,769
that and what are we going to get after

478
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,590
we can't shut down the whole company

479
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:08,450
shift the security and human spirit

480
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:10,970
rumors so be practical about it but

481
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:13,340
understand we are going to be honest try

482
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:16,220
to be better on all right

483
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:20,000
huge one here so this is from Erica a

484
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,730
software security report we measure

485
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:25,039
because we've scanned over 2 trillion

486
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,960
lines of code across thousands of

487
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,340
customers with tens of thousands of

488
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,830
applications the kind of things that

489
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,399
help them work better and faster

490
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,990
training leads the way it's times

491
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:38,840
difference if you train that so the

492
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,039
developers are putting in a fewer

493
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:43,190
developer and you can hand up if you

494
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,539
were trying to security it is part of

495
00:20:44,539 --> 00:20:45,169
your career

496
00:20:45,169 --> 00:20:51,070
all right apology one cute couple

497
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:53,450
if this is 25 years ago didn't have

498
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:55,899
application security back there that

499
00:20:55,899 --> 00:20:58,129
most people are coming out of college

500
00:20:58,129 --> 00:21:00,559
with little to no knowledge of

501
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,879
application security alert thank the

502
00:21:04,879 --> 00:21:07,909
people who journey of your workforce has

503
00:21:07,909 --> 00:21:09,649
never been trained we have to take that

504
00:21:09,649 --> 00:21:12,620
on as a cost of doing business we have

505
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,990
to teach them because I would rather

506
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,090
them write secure code then I'd have to

507
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:18,950
chase them with my tickets were my

508
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:23,330
ticket was not arias and chase them it's

509
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:25,100
around the stuff that they screwed up

510
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,740
the much better herds come out of the

511
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,570
finger secure we can help them do this

512
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:32,659
we have to be present for them and we

513
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:34,669
have the trillions else this is a

514
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:37,669
measure of people have used a learning

515
00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:39,230
versus not so that

516
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:43,129
on-demand training is great think about

517
00:21:43,129 --> 00:21:45,529
that think about doing it in

518
00:21:45,529 --> 00:21:48,529
instructor-led way so what I love here

519
00:21:48,529 --> 00:21:52,519
is take a look your security policy take

520
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,720
a look at what your application

521
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,540
are actually doing the production and

522
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,760
say what sequel checks you pick supplies

523
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,160
our biggest problem so I went to build

524
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,110
this room the stage for pizzas now you

525
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,220
going to do this in the right order if

526
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,390
you try to filled with developers and

527
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,250
then pizzas it doesn't work if you put

528
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,810
the piece into the developer whole top

529
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:11,060
so if your comments are moving in there

530
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,200
before they get there and we'll all

531
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,690
gratification to the room and then guess

532
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:16,040
what you can do you stand up here for

533
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,450
now while they're either eating

534
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:19,490
themselves it's factual about age

535
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:21,770
specification as earning your company

536
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:24,350
today it isn't be secure Java coding

537
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:27,470
course which has its merits but it's not

538
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:29,630
the best use of their time especially if

539
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:30,590
you're trying to get them to a point

540
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:31,850
where they stop doing the things that

541
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,020
are heard of you the most

542
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,360
so measure those things bills and

543
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,910
training around it get into that it's

544
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:39,530
the low cost way of getting a high

545
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:44,240
impact on the food's what's going to be

546
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:49,130
books actually about whose record good

547
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:54,230
excellent get these books this one first

548
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:58,610
and then a lot handbook I incredibly

549
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:00,800
valuable of helping you understand the

550
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,470
problems that these teams are facing and

551
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:06,260
there's a national security reason even

552
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:09,530
in a julian reliability is security in

553
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:12,830
technology organizations you'll see some

554
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:15,290
competition and this is all about anyone

555
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:20,030
under certain ship level this is the

556
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:22,100
whole idea in the industry right now the

557
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,950
same way we did shift less of quality so

558
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:26,510
that we wouldn't when we moved as when

559
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:29,420
we said okay let's make quality part of

560
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,860
the thing that developers have to worry

561
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,450
about so what we can think about it

562
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,160
earlier by doing things like test urban

563
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,190
development quality is front and center

564
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:39,440
it's like a better at doing quality one

565
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,870
do the same thing with security when

566
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:43,640
you've done the tools to be able to

567
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,320
measure that early and get better at it

568
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:51,100
over time next again they're not experts

569
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:54,320
to your point exactly about they don't

570
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,170
understand what we're the hell are we

571
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:59,990
we should be available or we should

572
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:02,270
provide services to them and help them

573
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:04,460
extra things that they're finding they

574
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,179
don't know what a cross-site

575
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:09,960
by error it is who's there to help them

576
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,659
we really wanted to help searching on

577
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:14,820
Google or photos information we rather

578
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:18,119
to buy them something me we can write in

579
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:20,580
security code that wraps some of this

580
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,169
stuff does the right input validation

581
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:24,990
says eight and this one of eight wrote

582
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:27,860
approach I am going to provide you some

583
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,029
libraries it seems none of this is up

584
00:24:30,029 --> 00:24:33,299
for free if it's broken is my problem if

585
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:35,669
you use it I will support it if you

586
00:24:35,669 --> 00:24:38,639
don't then you have to 50/50 shot okay

587
00:24:38,639 --> 00:24:40,619
so this is a place where we can pitch in

588
00:24:40,619 --> 00:24:43,639
and help them get more secure ask their

589
00:24:43,639 --> 00:24:46,230
in if you don't understand it need a

590
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:49,679
place to ask and it can't be a gatina

591
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,440
couple leaves so some companies provide

592
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,690
services around us the provider and

593
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:56,789
remediation guidance on how to think

594
00:24:56,789 --> 00:25:01,860
about these okay next one security

595
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,980
champions this is become very problem I

596
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,259
talked about at Davos conferences and

597
00:25:07,259 --> 00:25:11,190
talk a lot people set conferences people

598
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:13,830
are using this term very broadly in the

599
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:17,360
industry this is a way so who has

600
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,460
security organization more than twenty

601
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:28,639
feet okay allow more than 50 people look

602
00:25:28,669 --> 00:25:36,840
who's got Red Team Blue team but a lot

603
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,059
of these time to go to these customers

604
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:41,730
relation prospects and by the way one of

605
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:44,879
them was a privately held company that

606
00:25:44,879 --> 00:25:48,059
if they were on the S&P 500 would be

607
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:49,769
like one of the top ten biggest

608
00:25:49,769 --> 00:25:52,379
companies almost like one guy one I

609
00:25:52,379 --> 00:25:54,710
might not defecation spirited

610
00:25:54,710 --> 00:26:00,259
multi-billion dollar company whoa that

611
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:04,470
we need a witty and by the way you need

612
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:07,019
to have help appear more security people

613
00:26:07,019 --> 00:26:08,970
how many developers we trying to support

614
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:10,700
the best

615
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:14,789
hundred thousand typically you can't

616
00:26:14,789 --> 00:26:16,499
possibly be in all the meetings all of

617
00:26:16,499 --> 00:26:19,800
the places so what is done and this

618
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,050
different talk on this button to to

619
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:24,660
briefly give you this they becoming eyes

620
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,370
you experience on every single

621
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:28,110
development there should be at least one

622
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:30,360
of these people with this information

623
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,930
super girls on England's exams they need

624
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:36,060
to be there in the meetings part of the

625
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,580
development team I pick up a security

626
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,950
expert but they're more expert than the

627
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,270
regular game you're going to give them

628
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:44,970
additional training we're going to talk

629
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,680
to them about the basics parity where I

630
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,170
talk about CIA we're going to talk about

631
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:51,750
threat modeling we're going to talk

632
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,400
about and give them some instead of

633
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,170
grooming guidelines it looks like that

634
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:58,800
smells like this then Security right if

635
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,870
it's a form field and you need to worry

636
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:03,570
about these things if it's a HTTP header

637
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:05,550
if you're brought up worried about how

638
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,050
to be able to take those turtles in the

639
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:08,610
acceptance criteria inside of their

640
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:10,590
stories so that way they can make sure

641
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,180
that security take a character talk

642
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:15,810
about the verge didn't teach them how to

643
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:17,850
do secure code reviews now I'm not going

644
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:19,650
to be able to catch everything but

645
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:21,600
there's some small set and you can build

646
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,120
this over time about them understand

647
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,970
what to look for and what to do about

648
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:29,340
okay this is treating inside eating

649
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:34,440
armor also the red light goes right if

650
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,750
it touches my crypto touching my offend

651
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:39,210
and the toxic touches on see any of

652
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:41,760
those things security and probably pen

653
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,250
test okay so some of these things

654
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,880
absolutely positively pen test period

655
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,080
and they need to know that and you can

656
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,730
take that in that PT does they need to

657
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:51,780
think about how they're going to bundle

658
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,430
that software get into the puzzle

659
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:55,580
now we also do something at their code

660
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:58,440
CCI exercises with the developers will

661
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,690
show up in the bag everyone's going to

662
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:02,730
laptops after dark sighs bail will be

663
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:05,400
hackers it's super fun for developers to

664
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,900
go and do this and see the other side

665
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,240
and it helps a bit more offensively

666
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:14,040
about how they code understand that they

667
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:17,040
have limits at $80 animals when you get

668
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,140
beyond me me I go to one of my security

669
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:22,020
guys a moment of this but it doesn't

670
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,660
follow that I'm talking because we're

671
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,710
going to do something different with

672
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:29,490
this so this is capture eighty to ninety

673
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:31,110
percent of the stuff that happens every

674
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,190
day inside of your software

675
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:37,070
organization if you train them right so

676
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:39,770
here's a key strategy around doing this

677
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:41,299
Whiteside secured right like I said

678
00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:44,540
value dependency training all the time

679
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,250
we are constantly training our

680
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,990
developers and you should too

681
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:50,390
I want to start doing some of the tools

682
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:51,980
so these tools can find security

683
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:57,140
violations easily quickly and cheaply a

684
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,660
lot more cheaply than the calendar and

685
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:02,000
money China would take me for - go get a

686
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,830
pen doesn't go do something standard

687
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:06,020
analysis third party open-source risk I

688
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,580
want to understand that as soon as

689
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,169
possible the data start writing code I

690
00:29:09,169 --> 00:29:11,900
want to start sensitive with developers

691
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,610
country these tests come back and if I'm

692
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:16,010
that dirty a lot of private network so

693
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:17,750
we're going to go start annex means ask

694
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:21,020
me questions about hot Rebecca dynamic

695
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,700
analysis the second area couplets up in

696
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,200
line I just want to look at it from

697
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,210
multiple angles like I said not to say

698
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:29,480
the pen testing isn't useful I might do

699
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,309
some anyone heard of Rath more time

700
00:29:31,309 --> 00:29:34,000
application self protection so this is a

701
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,679
up-and-coming technology but here's the

702
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:40,210
security huge role big important job

703
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:42,260
helping in the very beginning those

704
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,610
worth here we're not all the way down

705
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:45,590
there and testing the staging right

706
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:47,690
doing threat modeling is pure design or

707
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:50,630
Jews we're here in the middle biggest

708
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:52,660
section hoping that this will define

709
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,710
what's the point of a security program

710
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,870
for not fixing stuff right if we're not

711
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:59,240
reducing the risk to our open and at the

712
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,490
end mainly fomentation testing outright

713
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:04,160
routine stuff that's all valuables it

714
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,660
takes that little about helping

715
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:09,010
monitoring and any products alone

716
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:11,510
alright so here is an example I want

717
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:15,970
anyone not heard of cix movie curvature

718
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:19,850
we're not any like rid of warnings so

719
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:23,000
here's our backlog and rest from pain we

720
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,880
think I've been developed now the way I

721
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,710
think about this I break this about and

722
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:29,990
attach two pieces of static analysis and

723
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:32,330
you go to San Antonio chicken is a

724
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:35,570
really important point people the stuff

725
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:37,190
that they're doing in that last diagram

726
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:39,679
the day they start coding what I would

727
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:41,600
call educational skin

728
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,210
educational analysis it's a constant

729
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:46,640
quick feedback and then data say from a

730
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,289
Dennis they can be devastating to the

731
00:30:48,289 --> 00:30:49,640
next night maybe I start thinking about

732
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,799
it and I don't make that mistake anymore

733
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:53,210
where's does something that's father

734
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:55,190
done in line before attacking my logical

735
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:57,440
application another look good not just

736
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,370
encode that I just wrote again for

737
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:04,669
checking this is part of in what Adam

738
00:31:04,669 --> 00:31:06,919
would call a definition of done if you

739
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:10,870
do your static analysis Macon documented

740
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,950
right because if you find something

741
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,659
later on in your assurance can't and it

742
00:31:14,659 --> 00:31:17,720
breaks the bill well who is the one that

743
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,630
didn't follow the process now again

744
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:24,289
that's my point about annual stuff if

745
00:31:24,289 --> 00:31:26,299
you have to do video accessing you have

746
00:31:26,299 --> 00:31:28,159
to do Co groupings we have to do you

747
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:31,520
eighty anything you have to do that is

748
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,840
we annual in nature requires a person a

749
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,220
four-decade

750
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,659
so maybe I took it into a branch I

751
00:31:38,659 --> 00:31:40,820
deploy this up up tell my fantastical

752
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,590
add I don't care how many things come

753
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,210
back to you when you're done once we

754
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:46,130
agree that it's fixing ready then I'll

755
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:47,659
check it and now we're going to the

756
00:31:47,659 --> 00:31:51,260
pipeline so this is all the network so

757
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,299
whenever you check in in a highly

758
00:31:53,299 --> 00:31:55,340
functioning operation where all the

759
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,760
tests you trust etc will fit into this

760
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,429
CITV pipeline and CI server my

761
00:32:01,429 --> 00:32:03,140
continuous integration server is going

762
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:05,419
to come up it's going to build it it's

763
00:32:05,419 --> 00:32:07,070
going to run unit tests static analysis

764
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:09,289
I'm going to get a result of those this

765
00:32:09,289 --> 00:32:11,120
is the continuous integration portion of

766
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,490
this pipeline I don't think you go to a

767
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:16,760
spin test this path all but easy typing

768
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,700
and I think you against me if it doesn't

769
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:22,669
a bill the bill synchronize the backlog

770
00:32:22,669 --> 00:32:24,770
hey guys it's all ready we're going to

771
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:28,370
stuff to giggle fix not again uncle and

772
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:30,200
non-functional side by side equal

773
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,010
partners it bums if it doesn't ask them

774
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:35,360
to start moving into operating

775
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,150
environments so I'll go to QA is aging

776
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:41,780
and production I'm going to run more

777
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:44,240
security against it in more testing so I

778
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,679
brought you some fresh intestines

779
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:48,679
dynamic analysis against it again I get

780
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:50,100
results

781
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,500
Kassadin loses the next day it doesn't

782
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,480
break the build this is the continuous

783
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,340
deployment or continue with delivery

784
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,900
portion of this pipeline this doesn't

785
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,900
have to all be automated but if you keep

786
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,030
one on at least hundreds of times a year

787
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:05,490
tens of times a day and activity you

788
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:07,740
have to trust all of that ethic go right

789
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:10,169
and that when those results come back it

790
00:33:10,169 --> 00:33:13,110
good you know say well let's pull it

791
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:15,809
over so that doesn't right understaffing

792
00:33:15,809 --> 00:33:19,470
you need identify those things early it

793
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:22,280
makes if they were given for socialism

794
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:27,090
so what all right so some conclusions

795
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:30,780
down you have to learn this stuff we'll

796
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,909
get those books read them talking

797
00:33:32,909 --> 00:33:34,320
ability to attend some of their

798
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,289
ceremonies so it you know a July

799
00:33:37,289 --> 00:33:39,960
this one called chickens and eggs but

800
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,070
things you know wanted to do the work

801
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:43,320
which it ought to spin and quietly and

802
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:47,070
observe it should allow chickens to come

803
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,419
into the room and watch these pheromones

804
00:33:48,419 --> 00:33:50,520
understand how to build software you

805
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,900
should understand how the sausage is

806
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,450
made

807
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:56,039
you gotta build relationships and you

808
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:58,710
have to demand accountability and it

809
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:00,780
can't be the lowest level security out

810
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,760
of the asset that is doing them it has

811
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,830
to happen at the high levels of C so and

812
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:07,470
a VP of development have to agree that

813
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:09,929
this is important to the company if it

814
00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:12,690
gets more visibility all the better that

815
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:14,190
will drive all the right behaviors down

816
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:16,190
a lot won't end up a ticket to sit there

817
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:19,800
silently with no comment on them on my

818
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,460
work on care yeah you have to build it

819
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:26,250
into your culture that are what you do

820
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:28,489
is if your work

821
00:34:28,489 --> 00:34:32,010
Traynham they don't know they're cut

822
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:34,550
from Nathan when it comes to security

823
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:36,750
typically now that doesn't mean that

824
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:39,300
they don't air just that they don't know

825
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,100
if they're all smart and in all the

826
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:46,918
worthies thanks open stuff you have to

827
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,139
adjust to the speed that that also

828
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:53,010
happens right yeah think about did that

829
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:55,260
really require pendants like you have to

830
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:58,070
pull it over for a two week or longer

831
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:01,980
review or going to use the tools that I

832
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:06,059
bought it built so when you're looking

833
00:35:06,059 --> 00:35:07,470
attenders and you're looking at

834
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:09,799
companies with bringing in too late

835
00:35:09,799 --> 00:35:12,390
really should look at most positive

836
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:14,819
false negative rate is are the results

837
00:35:14,819 --> 00:35:16,680
all you're not community say when this

838
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:20,760
ass is hot good or are you always going

839
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,920
to be skeptical are you always going to

840
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,240
happen touch with anytime you put people

841
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,220
in the mix you slow everything that when

842
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,599
you breed that person that so cause

843
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,880
developers push with the ax different

844
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:33,150
ways guys we're all set right so you

845
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,859
have to fit into their working style you

846
00:35:34,859 --> 00:35:38,790
have to work over there in mind I will

847
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:45,119
take some questions if it how'd you rate

848
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:51,299
this music sovereign outside

849
00:35:51,299 --> 00:35:54,319
Michael finger

850
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:14,070
so it is for specific for software that

851
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:18,000
you sell so it's operated as a service

852
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,710
or a software that you should preppin

853
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:30,450
and the customers okay but so you need

854
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:32,820
to build it telemetry not my hockey so

855
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,350
I'm recruited you eat your hands on

856
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:36,960
immediately right so if you think about

857
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,630
looking as a small person comedians

858
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,190
right I have all this stuff you come

859
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:43,440
tuned up all of my hoppers or my blogs

860
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,360
and other things that they come in here

861
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,130
and allow me know whether it's offertory

862
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:48,060
well or not

863
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,500
you need to fill that same pen

864
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,180
environment I would suggest dogfooding

865
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:54,270
it or one you cannot use II don't you

866
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:56,550
how it actually works so you can use it

867
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:57,750
as you can start thinking well what's

868
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,430
our material want to build in it's not

869
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:01,470
only when a customer calls you have a

870
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:04,560
playbook you can give them or you can

871
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,630
say a rocking these lines that would

872
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:08,910
tell me exactly what I need to know so

873
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:12,090
it's a little harder but it requires you

874
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:13,380
to understand how your software works

875
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,060
and if you're doing it just in the

876
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,500
quality environment I would already

877
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,120
that's not enough you really need to

878
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:22,250
experience the pain of the users

879
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:46,220
hi

880
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,310
is a different organization so I think I

881
00:37:57,310 --> 00:38:00,130
understand much the way you a different

882
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:01,600
organization does it but because of

883
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,420
running a customer environment yeah I do

884
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,740
it from we should fight to pick that one

885
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:07,570
offline there'll be a longer discussion

886
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:09,990
of panel man yes sir

887
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:13,860
what resources would you recommend for

888
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:16,650
helping to get a team they wanted to

889
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:19,240
personal all the theme of the speed with

890
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:24,280
this deadline so ask the question again

891
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,320
getting for a small company

892
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,660
yeah a lot of times what you're talking

893
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,670
about my pains met with a big company in

894
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,980
the end i working with company head of

895
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:36,520
life down and 104 so how could I get

896
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:39,640
them up to speed with its blocks so

897
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,920
they're able you got offs so I'm not a

898
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,350
rookie keep it at like I said most if

899
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:46,570
I'm going to see devil on top of an

900
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:48,430
agile methodology so I need to

901
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:50,560
understand those four cycle with

902
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,080
feedback loops certainly being a boss is

903
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,730
enough to get that started on that

904
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:57,400
journey attending conferences like the

905
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,120
dephasing

906
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,640
around the world there's always one

907
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,860
going on somewhere in the world there

908
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:05,370
regionals if are all over the place

909
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:08,560
there are lots of for me to go talk

910
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,350
about this stuff you learn by doing so

911
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:13,660
back I've even arguable it's built by

912
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:15,790
the practitioners themselves and

913
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:17,350
understand what doesn't work in the move

914
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:20,910
on the target sentence doesn't exist

915
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:25,510
what they don't have in change earlier

916
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:30,790
learn accountable not late operations

917
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:35,759
security humane all things equal

918
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:39,040
same time with your pushing left on the

919
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,920
process business pushing right here in a

920
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,450
world where you've got a different

921
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:44,380
change

922
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:47,829
profit margins 8:1 something that makes

923
00:39:47,829 --> 00:39:50,440
money they wasn't Alan this one

924
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,569
accountability not designing avoid yes

925
00:39:52,569 --> 00:39:53,109
sir

926
00:39:53,109 --> 00:39:55,359
really good talk when things mention

927
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,550
willfully really wanted to entrust with

928
00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:00,030
your developers want them to come be

929
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:02,530
sometimes that means getting in the

930
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:04,780
fight for them now they're they're 40

931
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,760
hours a week doing coming home I don't

932
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,900
even think about the other stuff

933
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,119
sometimes there's enterprise level you

934
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:13,060
have to building programs give them

935
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:15,329
tools given trains or enterprise level

936
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:18,640
tools creating trust yeah buildings

937
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,200
going for them like I said before that a

938
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,609
forward approach works really well

939
00:40:21,609 --> 00:40:23,079
because they don't want to have to do

940
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:25,089
hope you could help them get up what

941
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,280
kind of do that go out Kate training and

942
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,040
YouTube code things like code manners

943
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,589
yeah development I think take your time

944
00:40:32,589 --> 00:40:34,480
learn how to write code or write code

945
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,010
capture I can't read efficient

946
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:38,470
collection rate over time tortilla

947
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:40,599
systems later is one more listen have

948
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:42,069
you approached customer pregnant

949
00:40:42,069 --> 00:40:43,329
intimidation when they're not going to

950
00:40:43,329 --> 00:40:45,220
take up things cuz we're producing to

951
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:48,760
take up well so there is nothing less

952
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,980
right if you are releasing something

953
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:54,400
that has security changes in it look at

954
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,530
you all you can do and what does the

955
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:57,760
place like the thought of it

956
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,589
Security's head was development so you

957
00:40:59,589 --> 00:41:01,390
can think about that as companies you

958
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:04,960
can stay a lady think is because there's

959
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,369
lots of reasons an organization where

960
00:41:06,369 --> 00:41:07,569
they might not be able to being these

961
00:41:07,569 --> 00:41:10,690
changes they might have change walk or

962
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:12,730
they can't black house where they can't

963
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:15,040
be choosers and project all you can do

964
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,869
is educate them and said here's what's

965
00:41:16,869 --> 00:41:21,099
in here applies importance excuses and a

966
00:41:21,099 --> 00:41:24,460
vapid take or not take days of endless

967
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:27,010
just so long educate the properly thank

968
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:28,210
you

969
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:35,489
[Applause]
