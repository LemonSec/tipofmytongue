00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,710
community built upon his face so if you

5
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,929
know this isn't good or do we look like

6
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:10,769
the part down there

7
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:12,599

00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,450
all right so going to echo some comments

15
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,430
and you can you hear me without the mic

16
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:54,739
I tend to wander and lock good alright

17
00:00:54,739 --> 00:00:56,600
alright so I want to say thanks a lot

18

19
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:04,250
event and having the local audience here

20
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,740
guys that I can reach out to you can

21
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,200
reach out to me is invaluable in our

22
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,150
community or community built on trust

23
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,820
so thanks long intricated the only

24
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,130
criticism I ask is if this event sells

25
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,020
out faster than a Jimmy Buffett concert

26
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,750
on Saturday at Starling or what you can

27
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:24,770
be starving so it's pretty common I'm

28
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:27,470
here today anyone politics about online

29
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:31,100
advertising and I got to say first and

30
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,869
foremost them leads and I don't see any

31
00:01:32,869 --> 00:01:35,300
tinfoil hats in the audience and this is

32
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,670
a no tinfoil hat allowed type of

33
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:39,710
presentation I'm going to give you some

34
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:42,020
background about what's going on with

35
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,899
online advertising I kind of fell into

36
00:01:44,899 --> 00:01:45,860
it by accident

37
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,950
a little bit about that and this this

38
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:52,099
world is absolutely amazing again I

39
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:54,440
don't see a lot of awareness about it in

40
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,840
our community so I want to start going

41
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,700
to lay a little bit of groundwork about

42
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,310
how things are built on the internet and

43
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,399
how advertising is kind of foundational

44
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,319
for that hopefully kind of change your

45
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:08,630
mind - Don Londoner Linnell online

46
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,300
advertising really means to you because

47
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,830
that then let me go back and figure out

48
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,239
what that means as you protect your

49
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,010
network as you figure out what that

50
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,790
means for privacy what you have to do

51
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,110
when your next-door neighbor ask you

52
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,420
about that creepy ad that keeps

53
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,670
following them all over the Internet

54
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:28,540
they'll be having in this creepy yet

55
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:31,190
yeah so this is the southern belly fat

56
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:38,209
week want everybody back right so and

57
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:40,040
what I mean by I don't want to be

58
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,150
paranoid about this is that if you know

59
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,670
even going back to the earliest days of

60
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,970
newspaper curiosity can you get a

61
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,660
newspaper that doesn't have ads is

62
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,760
they don't exist the magazine that

63
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,520
doesn't have at it just doesn't exist no

64
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,320
matter where you go you're going to run

65
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,720
into advertising advertising time you

66
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,230
know it's just a part of our society and

67
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,440
so as part of that I want to recognize

68
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,340
that that all not all ads are evil in

69
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:15,790
fact I want to propose to you that ads

70
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,160
are instant improving jumping so we

71
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,050
don't necessarily have to block them all

72
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,240
let's see and try and understand a

73
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,470
little bit more about what's going on

74
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:28,180
here and this is again this is just an

75
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,270
immensely complex kind of issue there's

76
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,950
a lot of stuff if you climb this entry's

77
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,620
Galasso online and the community is very

78
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,720
open about what they're doing with

79
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,910
online advertising all you have to do is

80
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:42,850
ask you could videos wonderful videos

81
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,470
out there because there are all the

82
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,880
marketing guides that are building these

83
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,310
videos and they want you to understand

84
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,680
what they're so there's lovely places

85
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,760
where you can go to find out more the

86
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,740
genesis of this talk is it's kind of

87
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,480
like if the work that I did in this area

88
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,810
started first there's some questions I'm

89
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:04,470
an FBI about what's real-time bidding

90
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,700
advertising start looking into it and

91
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,330
then I went to work and I got a request

92
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:13,630
across my desk where marketing said hey

93
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:16,350
we want to put a pixel on our website

94
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:19,510
okay that feels okay right it's just a

95
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,500
pixel okay

96
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,590
so this is essentially what we're being

97
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,180
asked to approve from a security

98
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,130
standpoint are you okay with this making

99
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,170
any problems with this you put this on

100
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:33,970
your website if you did just like

101
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,770
everybody else in the world all right

102
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,810
these are everywhere all right it needs

103
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,520
your tracking pick we used to think that

104
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,590
they were evil because your ice cream X

105
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,360
police and so on but now they're

106
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,090
actually heavily used in the marketing

107
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,580
industry but this not you're thinking

108
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,670
what am I actually doing so let's take a

109
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,640
look real quick at what it means an

110
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,230
online advertising guy I know you

111
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,300
probably can't see a lot as well kind of

112
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,600
explain to you what these pieces are up

113
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,690
but when you're on the internet you go

114
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,060
out and you request

115
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,580
content from a Content publisher pretty

116
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,800
standard you go to cnn.com and you ask

117
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,170
for a webpage and once you ask for a

118
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,360
webpage you get your content back but

119
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,930
also embed it in there is your ad so

120
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:20,850
your browser then goes out and request

121
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:23,250
the ad that's pretty straightforward and

122
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,860
then the ad comes back right and you're

123
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,590
redirected to go get the content from an

124
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,210
ad server that's usually somebody else

125
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,910
in this might both be from CNN two

126
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,670
different servers at CNN and then that

127
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,350
has sort of where it's actually going to

128
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,870
redirect you out to some sort of ad

129
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,640
agency server may be a double-click

130
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,980
server or something like that and then

131
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,360
you build your page and you're done

132
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,210
right you're familiar with that right if

133
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,740
you've seen that good down here

134
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,230
right well the interesting thing is it's

135
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,080
really not that simple

136
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,970
if I were to number this in the simplest

137
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,740
version there's actually like about a

138
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,890
dozen steps before you actually get that

139
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:04,350
ad back to your browser now that's what

140
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,820
I kind of want to show you you missed

141
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,730
apply some of that what actually happens

142
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:11,580
between the time when you request an ad

143
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,090
and you get the ad is that that real

144
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:18,600
estate for you as an individual actually

145
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,770
is sent out to bid in real time somebody

146
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:25,950
said oh you know I have this type of

147
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,440
person I have this type of ad campaign I

148
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,420
put them together and I deliver you your

149
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,640
personal ID that this all falls under

150
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,620
the ground will expand its programmatic

151
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,900
bidding so if you want to look into this

152
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,700
more you can start with programmatic

153
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,600
bidding which cost a lot about cannot

154
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,030
what is this automatic advertising

155
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:49,250
involved back in here we have kind of

156
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,110
four different quadrants the ones that

157
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,870
we care about here's is in your work

158
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:58,890
there's a fixed price for that ad that

159
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,600
that's reserved for you so if you got a

160
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,460
banner ad and you know who's going to

161
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,890
drop their ad in there that guy sits in

162
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,270
here and this is our traditional realm

163
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,340
and that still exists today for some

164
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,920
cases in some cases you might have a

165
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,050
fixed price bag that goes down through a

166
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,610
number of different people that might

167
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:17,730
choose whether or not to the advertiser

168
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,340
to buy that has

169
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,560
but where it gets really interesting is

170
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,110
up here when that ad space is put out

171
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,930
for auction and that what's known as

172
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,970
real time business but we'll dig into

173
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:32,780
this area a little bit more all right in

174
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,750
order to do that I think you can't do

175
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,090
this - well we're working down here

176
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,460
about you know your area I want to go

177
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,590
separate over here talk a little bit

178
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:46,160
about the marketing area for men there's

179
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,010
a number of folks that wants to sell you

180
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:49,610

181

182
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,240
wants to sell you something right so

183
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,700
these are folks that have a brand and

184
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,230
when you have a brand and you want to

185
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,030
sell your product you work with the

186
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:01,430
marketing agency right so marketing

187
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,920
agency gives you that overall how we're

188
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,660
going to produce our brand what our

189
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,090
statistics are you know who we want to

190
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:11,090
get getting you that whole thing about

191
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,010
how I Drive my business forward

192
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:15,710
you may choose if you have a brand you

193
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,390
may choose to go directly to an ad

194
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:20,090
agency it just says you know I want to

195
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:22,460
advertise my brand or you may do a whole

196
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,320
marketing campaign somewhere along the

197
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,970
way you deal with these folks you may

198
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,560
actually just go directly to an online

199
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,620
ad network as well but there's no match

200
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,110
of business that happens over here and

201
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:36,500
this is a huge huge business right this

202
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,260
online marketing business if we have a

203
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:43,390
guess on how big this is in terms of GDP

204
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:50,030
this is 6% 6% of the u.s. GDP is

205
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:53,450
involved in this whole marketing and

206
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,850
digital marketing effort it's

207
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,110
extraordinary

208
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,420
with the size and the crepitus this

209
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,210
stuff this whole market all right

210
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:05,060
so let's go back we've got this just ad

211
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,010
campaign being set up brands that want

212
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:09,260
to market to you that one advertised

213
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,930
view that's going on over here let's go

214
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:14,840
back to where we were with you visiting

215
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,030
the internet and going out to your

216
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,860
absolute so the first thing that

217
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:23,300
actually happens when when this ad is is

218
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,820
offered up by a CNN or something like

219
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,120
that

220
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,910
is that it goes to what's known as a

221
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,550
supply-side platform

222
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,800
right a supply-side platform is where

223
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,610
you set up your your view as a publisher

224
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,700
a publisher can set up an offer real

225
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,560
estate out for bid

226
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,470
so this is where somebody will make

227
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:48,440
money online so CNN wants to make money

228
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,230
off of presenting you news they can

229
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,570
offer up this real estate through a

230
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,150
supply-side platinum right now set up

231
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,040
rules and what like a real estate they

232
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,380
have and what's like it can't be with

233
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,240
such a face is that they can offer them

234
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,640
what the good audience for that but it's

235
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,260
all about them

236
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:09,010
being on the supply side and offerings

237
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:12,320
offering up real estate for a user

238
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,530
that's me drop an ad right so the thing

239
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:17,660
to the supply-side platform might work

240
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,580
on and things like if I ever seen this

241
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,710
person before and if I clean them before

242
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,840
but like the things are they interested

243
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,270
what do I know about this person it's

244
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,790
kind of individually talking about one

245
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:31,220
website so maybe they could new things

246
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,100
that you you view or so on that do I

247
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,740
have any data also that's provided by a

248
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,650
third party we'll come back to this but

249
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,990
essentially trying to create a persona

250
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:45,980
about you the visitor to publishers ads

251
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,930
like that they need to make some

252
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:49,490
revenues they can continue publishing

253
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:54,050
content right so after that goes to

254
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:56,140
supply-side platform and this is all

255
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:59,690
actually on the sell side so this is on

256
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:02,090
on if you consider this an exchange come

257
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:04,250
back that this is the sell side of the

258
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,800
exchange whereas this is the buy side of

259
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,810
the exchange right so these folks are

260
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:11,660
all selling real estate so the next

261
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,340
thing that happens after the publisher

262
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,220
sends it to the supply side platform

263
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,080
lifelike platform ads in and aggregates

264
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,870
and stuff about you as an individual

265
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:23,440
about what the publisher wants to do

266
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,590
then that goes off to an exchange right

267
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:30,080
and this exchange actually does work

268
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:34,580
like a real goodness exchange where this

269
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:38,540
is a bit alright so the real estate that

270
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,520
in your browser is being presented of

271
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,550
being built that is sent out for bid

272
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,380
it's embraced with additional

273
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,000
information from the supplies my plan

274
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,209
right the exchange may have some pre

275
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,220
cash bid and may be able to answer this

276
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,709
off really quick but sometimes it

277
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:58,100
doesn't so it wants to send that out for

278
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,870
bids it wants to offer up that real

279
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:02,450
estate to other folks and that's where

280
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:04,420
we get into the demand side platform

281
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,950
somewhere before all this trades

282
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:09,470
actually happen the exact agencies have

283
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:12,860
actually worked with the demand side the

284
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,860
buy side folks to say this is the type

285
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,200
of thing we want to buy you want to buy

286
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:23,149
people that are interested in travel

287
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:24,950
vacation or interested in that thing

288
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,839
that you looked at and I'm going to Home

289
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:29,120
Depot add or something like that that's

290
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,519
all set up in our demand side platform I

291
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,690
set up yep

292
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:36,320
the algorithms or whatever so then when

293
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,680
the exchange all first is now for bid

294
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,040
the multiple demand-side platforms and

295
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,019
to take the other exchanges another

296
00:12:45,019 --> 00:12:47,810
online ad networks now the demand side

297
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:50,779
platform can offer up their bid just as

298
00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:52,880
how much I'm going to pay for that ad

299
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,420
that's being rendered in your realm the

300
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,279
big sense of for you follow me my go too

301
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:02,089
fast good alright did you ever know this

302
00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:06,529
is going on okay so you see a little bit

303
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:08,870
of it but it's crazy right so they offer

304
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:11,029
up a bid and that the exchange does

305
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:13,270
actually a you know what you won the bid

306
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:17,029
so so they will notify the winner that

307
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:19,070
they've won the bid and then the winner

308
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:22,430
actually will provide instructions back

309
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,770
to the exchange or what's the display in

310
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,760
your website and how the display right

311
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,470
so that bit goes through and that

312
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,089
actually gets passed all the way back

313
00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:34,430
through this system back to the

314
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:37,040
publisher ad server this bid happens

315
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,769
within believe it's 10 milliseconds all

316
00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:42,110
right so this is fairly fast transaction

317
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,720
this old cycle should happen in less

318
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,490
than a second preferably less than a

319
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:48,290
half a second while you're loading up

320
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:53,060
your weapons and then finally you get

321
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,550
directed to the agencies ad server and

322
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,380
you're set on your merry way to go and

323
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:00,529
deliver that any questions about this

324
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:04,730
general club okay so you get the idea of

325
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:09,140
the self side versus the by side setting

326
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,360
up marketing campaigns and defining this

327
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,060
whole project here and that finally you

328
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:18,740
getting directed to an end so that's

329
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,510
fine but that still didn't answer the

330
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:23,300
question about what is it why do I draw

331
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,750
a pixel on my website because my website

332
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,550
is not involved in this I am NOT

333
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:31,160
publishing content I'm just doing a

334
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,320
marketing campaign so where does that

335
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,250
pixel come in and that deals with these

336
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,700
folks that are known as the DMP or the

337
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,060
data providers right and this is where

338
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:48,560
it gets a little bit more interesting so

339
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,440
in the data management platform the

340
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,600
purpose of the data management platform

341
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,470
is to coordinate across multiple sites

342
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:01,130
across multiple days and to kind of

343
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:03,200
understand a little bit more about you

344
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,029
so I can actually target things that

345
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,700
you're interested so again this is our

346
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,450
flow here right and the question is why

347
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:16,550
did this guy actually wins that bit we

348
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,770
understood about the technology to kind

349
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:21,020
of put this whole in place but why did

350
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,180
he actually win that bid and that's what

351
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,089
has to do with the data management data

352
00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:27,670
management platform actually deals with

353
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:33,950
marketing agencies ad agencies on the on

354
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:36,770
the buy side and then on the sell side

355
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,050
they also work with publishers publisher

356
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:42,110
content servers to get information about

357
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,810
the visitors right and then link all

358
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,390
that information together so now when

359
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:50,779
I'm at the publishers ad server going to

360
00:15:50,779 --> 00:15:53,449
work with the supply-side platform I can

361
00:15:53,449 --> 00:15:54,890
tell a little bit more about who's

362
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:56,720
visiting based on data that's provided

363
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,560
by this data management plan okay so

364
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,779
this is passing a persona up here to

365
00:16:02,779 --> 00:16:05,060
match it over here to make a better bid

366
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,290
make a better offer

367
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,040
to get a higher base

368
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,900
okay things that a management platform

369
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,360
actually does this is this is where it

370
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,170
gets a little bit interesting okay so

371
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,970
some of the data sources that they do

372
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:23,340
that they have or obviously you know

373
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,840
your inputs and your visits to your site

374
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,560
you also have email databases think

375
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,450
about your email things about your de

376
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:33,000
place think about other campaigns that

377
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,600
are going on all kinds of first party

378
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,910
and third party data so things they know

379
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:41,220
about you directly and also things that

380
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,110
they might be able to purchase and link

381
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:46,220
to your online identity so big

382
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,690
information about you go ahead and

383
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:51,030
knowledge about the computer consumer

384
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:53,430
that the supply side providers and add

385
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:56,280
the beef offer before that offer goes up

386
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,860
to the exchange and they collect the

387
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,480
data collect bugs data and do the

388
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,740
analysis these are the big data counts

389
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:07,470
and then their output exactly to work

390
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,540
with online advertising and marketing

391
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,699
campaigns and not just the online

392
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:14,160
campaign but the overall marketing

393
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,250
campaign so they might be able to go in

394
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,819
a data and this data management platform

395
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:22,890
they may actually coordinate with a

396
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,839
print campaign or something along this

397
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:27,199
line it doesn't have to be jumped online

398
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:32,660
it can be the overall marketing campaign

399
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:37,200
so going back to that pixel now if

400
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,330
you're working in corporate you have a

401
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:41,010
corporate website your ads to drop a

402
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:45,090
pixel on to your website so here we have

403
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:48,210
you as a visitor coming to a website and

404
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:51,690
dropping up pixel epics will will come

405
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,150
back in to request and actually send you

406
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:57,540
out in direct or indirect out to the

407
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,960
data management platform so now if

408
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,670
you're providing one in corporate

409
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:05,310
website if somebody has had an intro

410
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,650
in my website so they visited my website

411
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:10,950
the maybe are often we have going to a

412
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:13,470
retail site and they'll drop a pixel on

413
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:15,540
a retail place let them know a little

414
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,370
bit about what you're interested in and

415
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:19,320
the next time you visit somebody else in

416
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,600
this ecosystem that that a management

417
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,340
platform will understand and you're kind

418
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,990
of interested in taking a vacation

419
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:27,840
buying a new fence for the backyard or

420
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:33,930
dealing with sellers belly fat right so

421
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:35,700
the data management platform that has

422
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,160
its pedicles if you will has its

423
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,130
connection into all kinds of places

424
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:44,190
within this ad infrastructure in

425
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,140
particular when we talk about going to

426
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:50,310
multiple content publishers the data

427
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,560
management platform can have a one

428
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,540
platform can add LinkedIn to multiple

429
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:57,540
publishers multiple ad servers and then

430
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,850
the service providers these tracking

431
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:02,880
pixels that show up on sites that are

432
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,010
not ones that are actually advertising

433
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,410
their services that your sister offer

434
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:10,530
whether that's you're trying to

435
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:14,700
okay you okay with that question so

436
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,850
forth all right all right so one thing I

437
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:20,520
didn't want to until I said this the

438
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,140
simple hats but there's a little bit of

439
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,760
evilness in the air when it comes to

440
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,590
malware sizing so understanding how

441
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,810
malware typing fits into this whole

442
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:30,870
realm you know if we have this kind of

443
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:36,390
setup here great you have probably seen

444
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:39,960
from time to time when your users will

445
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,410
get redirected out to a malicious site

446
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:46,200
through a tag okay and this is

447
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,120
particularly challenging because you're

448
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,390
down here you can see your user getting

449
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,570
directed to hear you hopefully will be

450
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,850
able to see that you know they ask for

451
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:58,650
an ad and gotten the ad got redirected

452
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:03,030
and redirected them to an evil place but

453
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:05,340
the problem is you don't know where in

454
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:08,490
this whole cycle that redirect happens

455
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,830
right so that redirect may have happened

456
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:13,290
because you have an ad agency that

457
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:15,240
injected itself into this whole thing

458
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,090
that it's less than reputable or makes

459
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:19,920
just simply may not double-check things

460
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,680
that are sent out for advertising and

461
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,450
maybe if somebody on the demand side

462
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:28,050
platform actually paid a premium for the

463
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:31,050
user on your network it may be that

464
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:34,080
somebody on the supply side platform did

465
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,390
something as well so this kind of cycle

466
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:39,390
is subject to a little bit of frog makes

467
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:41,250
it very difficult to track down what the

468
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:44,850
root cause we've had a couple of really

469
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:48,900
interesting events here where the left

470
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,380
hooks

471
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:54,570
don't go visit local sites right one of

472
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,730
my favorites was he was a local

473
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:59,820
newspaper tonight and our users were

474
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,950
getting redirected to Pittsburgh mom

475
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:02,950
calm

476
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:06,340
right you've heard of Fitchburg dead if

477
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,830
I heard of Pittsburgh dead okay then

478
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:11,289
they heard of Fitchburg mom yeah no I

479
00:21:11,289 --> 00:21:13,239
never heard of it it was categorized as

480
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:15,220
malicious apparently at one point years

481
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,980
ago something was clop there right and

482
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:21,039
so for some reason Pittsburgh mom was

483
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,799
you know it was a ad source a

484
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:26,320
destination and we went back and we

485
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,389
could figure out that users to a

486
00:21:28,389 --> 00:21:30,759
newspaper local newspaper get redirected

487
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:33,580
out the Pittsburgh mom but who was it

488
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:37,799
that was actually doing it my brother

489
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:40,299
this those we've opened a lot of

490
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,940
interesting questions about how you

491
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:46,539
could actually target your user

492
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:50,109
population because we can target you as

493
00:21:50,109 --> 00:21:53,109
a consumer so well arguably we fetch a

494
00:21:53,109 --> 00:21:58,539
target with malicious codes all right so

495
00:21:58,539 --> 00:22:00,639
you're okay with this general structure

496
00:22:00,639 --> 00:22:02,859
on how this is all set up all right

497
00:22:02,859 --> 00:22:04,659
let's talk a little bit about some of

498
00:22:04,659 --> 00:22:07,779
the players this is where for me it got

499
00:22:07,779 --> 00:22:10,600
kind of really surprising

500
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:15,669
first of all publishers write compact

501
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:19,259
publishers do you recognize these

502
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:26,200
okay okay is Facebook free sure it's

503
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,960
free right again not really right if you

504
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,330
think about what the space will know

505
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:33,879
about you well not you guys cuz you guys

506
00:22:33,879 --> 00:22:36,429
security console hasta bug that's what

507
00:22:36,429 --> 00:22:38,799
the space will know about your kids and

508
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,519
your parents all right and then put that

509
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:45,179
into the data management platform right

510
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:47,470
because that's how these guys make their

511
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:47,889
money

512
00:22:47,889 --> 00:22:50,500
LinkedIn until they make their money all

513
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,789
right that's how they provide this

514
00:22:51,789 --> 00:22:54,370
service is with the advertising right

515
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:56,259
it's just like subsidizing your

516
00:22:56,259 --> 00:22:59,320
newspaper you have to get an ad in your

517
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,000
newspaper in order your newspaper to

518
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,370
cost beyond what it costs so it's part

519
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:04,120
of the cost

520
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,450
all right but it's not just that right

521
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:09,730
let's just share with everybody all

522
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:13,240
right and if you think about it like all

523
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,850
these social media sites they're all

524
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:18,610
tags and you have to share this tag

525
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:22,179
embedded all over the Internet right

526
00:23:22,179 --> 00:23:24,460
because that actually does a phone home

527
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:27,279
to these content providers which puts

528
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:31,779
you in the mix so now when you're

529
00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:33,759
visiting a site to have to share this ad

530
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:36,789
and there's some knowledge that it's you

531
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:39,070
that's visiting this there's an

532
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:41,080
interesting kind of potential mix there

533
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:45,330
right that's from the publisher side

534
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:47,830
just walking through there's a number of

535
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:51,580
different kind of faces around here so

536
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,919
for instance you'll see a lot of this in

537
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,679
this industry where on the supply side

538
00:23:56,679 --> 00:23:59,799
platform Facebook does not have its own

539
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:01,809
supply side platform but basal block

540
00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:04,960
library and library is a significant

541
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,960
player all right so and you see a lot of

542
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,970
these publishers down here that are

543
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:11,649
making a lot of money that acquire

544
00:24:11,649 --> 00:24:15,508
different parts of this holy

545
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:18,669
it's also interesting these ad exchange

546
00:24:18,669 --> 00:24:22,750
ad exchanges app connected to the large

547
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:26,379
one open X is one but also Microsoft

548
00:24:26,379 --> 00:24:29,830
operates an ad exchange and we go to

549
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:32,350
Microsoft and you'll see a lot of this

550
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:36,159
where you have terms the clay on all

551
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:40,539
sides of this ecosystem those on the

552
00:24:40,539 --> 00:24:43,600
demand side and the supply side usually

553
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,820
they should be separated out to make the

554
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:50,860
bit fair but yeah if players on all

555
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:53,080
sides this one you might find

556
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,179
interesting as well who wants

557
00:24:55,179 --> 00:25:01,539
double-click how's that ok Google right

558
00:25:01,539 --> 00:25:03,250
and Google's your friend Kaku all the

559
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:06,000
tons of stuff for you for free right

560
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,639
yeah so Google has global click so

561
00:25:09,639 --> 00:25:12,340
Google nutzy that not in foil hat right

562
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,720
I'm just talking organizational

563
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,370
relationships I don't know how this

564
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:18,700
whole piece is out but Google on the

565
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,259
puzzle content side has

566
00:25:20,259 --> 00:25:22,779
double-click for publishers double-click

567
00:25:22,779 --> 00:25:25,389
based manager as a supplied by platform

568
00:25:25,389 --> 00:25:28,169
double-click operates an ad exchange

569
00:25:28,169 --> 00:25:31,830
double-click also has digital marketing

570
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:35,110
and so they spit this whole entire

571
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:38,649
structure right and Google now

572
00:25:38,649 --> 00:25:40,899
double-click can all feed into this

573
00:25:40,899 --> 00:25:43,500
gonna man

574
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,700
this one also is pretty surprising to me

575
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,930
look at one of the largest data

576
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:53,870
management platforms I don't think of

577
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:56,060
Salesforce as being in the online

578
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:59,420
advertising business all right but they

579
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,980
actually are white a large data

580
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:05,090
management platform along with Adobe all

581
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:08,480
right along with work so really

582
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,370
interesting kind of like food some of

583
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:12,680
the players are in this market space if

584
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,080
you tease it all out can you read this

585
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:19,880
in the back okay because this is this is

586
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,560
like the complexity and this is why this

587
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:25,060
is 6% of the GDP right it's such a large

588
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:28,160
kind of infrastructure of all kinds of

589
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,820
things going on

590
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:35,380
so I had a number of additional thoughts

591
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:38,330
just things that are interesting when

592
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,980
you work in this realm

593
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:42,080
there are some publishers that you can

594
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,410
avoid so you might say again if you're

595
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:49,790
being very privacy concern you might say

596
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,530
I just don't want to deal with tracking

597
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:53,240
pixels or I want to turn them off

598
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,500
right well it can be as not you as as

599
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:01,220
you looking up your airline reservation

600
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,500
her doing your online check-in for your

601
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,870
airline reservation if you look at the

602
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:09,830
cookie policy of your online airline

603
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,600
reservation they have third party

604
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,880
cookies and we use this for marketing

605
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,210
materials do they do it I don't know do

606
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:18,950
they have the ability to do it certainly

607
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:21,140
it's in the ability so when you think

608
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,060
about something as innocuous getting

609
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:26,950
your checking in for an airline ticket

610
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:29,860
if you feed yourself into this whole

611
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:32,840
ecosystem you just can't avoid it all

612
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,280
right and this is to my point of

613
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,880
recognize what it is so then you can

614
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,440
think about where is the security of

615
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,060
privacy in fact I could track you by

616
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,800
email and feed you into this whole

617
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,950
system if you allow the embedded images

618
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:51,380
once again you're feeding yourself into

619
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,000
this whole ecosystem

620
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,090
also mention that there's a trend in the

621
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:58,970
industry to separate out cookie policies

622
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:01,910
from privacy home they might here know

623
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:04,280
if they're firm has a cookie a separate

624
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:09,650
cookie policy so nobody okay so there

625
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:11,420
are a number of and there's a lot of

626
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,460
movement in the industry to separate out

627
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,440
your cookie policy and your privacy

628
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,290
Falls alright and if you look at some of

629
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:20,600
these two links I have in here if you

630
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,130
look particularly at the Google cookie

631
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:25,040
policy very well read very open about

632
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,980
what's going on very clear about what a

633
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:31,460
cookie is and there's also a lot of

634
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:34,100
separation here between the United

635
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,330
States

636
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:37,640
maybe you alright so privacy means

637
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,810
something very different in that you

638
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:40,340
used to a lot of times there's be a very

639
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:43,250
different privacy policy or you'll be

640
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,590
forced to acknowledge of cookies because

641
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:48,640
of the privacy implications okay

642
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,110
have you heard about the ABS locking and

643
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:54,740
coming up in chrome it's a pretty cool

644
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:57,290
stuff right all right as an after built

645
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:58,910
into chrome sounds good right

646
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:01,990
you know what the Chrome ad blocker is

647
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:05,210
what's up filter it's a filter

648
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:08,900
well guess other than Google yes yeah

649
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:12,380
it's a it's a HIPAA and so Google is

650
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,330
right all over this so and that's what I

651
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:16,250
mean that's best that that's the point

652
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:18,590
to Google being all over this and

653
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,360
Microsoft being on and all these key

654
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,730
players being olives you can't fight the

655
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:24,680
momentum like you're stuck in this

656
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,140
ecosystem so make it work for you make

657
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,060
it secure for you on the Google

658
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,520
standpoint the Google upcoming has

659
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,430
Locker and CRO that's built in is an

660
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:37,010
enforcement tool and if you look at this

661
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:39,350
there's a lot of movement in here to to

662
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:42,440
good ads right because every going to

663
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,970
like the ad that when you click on the

664
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:47,720
webpage it starts talking okay that's a

665
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,390
bad ad in the Google Chrome ad blocker

666
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:52,460
will block do that because they don't

667
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,290
conform to the Amster standards how

668
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:56,180
about that one that shows off and covers

669
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:59,150
your page it says your past is looking

670
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,710
at this for 30 seconds and then you can

671
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:01,520
click Next

672
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,610
right badass and this whole industry is

673
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:08,450
driving towards good ass another

674
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:10,370
interesting feature about ad blockers

675
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:11,990
you can say I'm let's turn on an ad

676
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:15,050
blocker and get rid of all of this stuff

677
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:17,210
and maintain my privacy

678
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:21,290
there's Price Waterhouse Cooper did some

679
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:24,710
good research behind this and they

680
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:27,830
believe based on their studies that we

681
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:30,740
can get you to turn off your ad blocker

682
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:33,360
two-thirds of the time

683
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,340
all right and this is everyone all right

684
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,320
so you included it two-thirds of this

685
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,970
time I convinced can convince you to

686
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,890
turn off your ad blocker I think about

687
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:42,780
it you brought across it hey I'll let

688
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,550
you read a part of this article but you

689
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,170
got to turn on that before you get read

690
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:48,930
the little thing or you can only watch

691
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,840
the first 30 seconds of this video right

692
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,170
so that's all built into that and and

693
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:57,360
it's to make the intent is to make

694
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,400
revenue while also making the internet a

695
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,460
pleasing experience a lot of interesting

696
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,890
facets built into this whole thing all

697
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:07,050
right so with that I'm going to leave it

698
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:09,210
open for questions I don't know how much

699
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:11,480
I can answer because this is a huge area

700
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,890
but I just want to make sure that you're

701
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:17,520
aware of this entire ecosystem of online

702
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,620
advertising so that you can reason about

703
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,030
what it means to you for the sake of

704
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:23,670
security what it means for your most

705
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:26,250
importantly for online privacy what you

706
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:31,740
can and can't do any questions yes it's

707
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,240
really the only effective way to break

708
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,140
that name to lock and I think a server

709
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:40,370
there somewhere a long way

710
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:42,679
trying to fight it so two questions

711
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:45,230
there can I break the chain and how can

712
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:47,389
I fight in West militias all right so

713
00:31:47,389 --> 00:31:50,720
can I break the chain I don't think you

714
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,789
can break this chain I don't think you

715
00:31:52,789 --> 00:31:54,889
can break it any more than you can go

716
00:31:54,889 --> 00:31:57,830
shopping at the grocery store without

717
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:00,409
having to step on an advertisement as

718
00:32:00,409 --> 00:32:02,240
you go to get your service all right

719
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,759
it's built in all right so as far as

720
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:07,399
malicious campaign when you have a

721
00:32:07,399 --> 00:32:09,380
malicious advert ads that's being

722
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:12,380
delivered to you I think content

723
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,629
management here works very well in

724
00:32:14,629 --> 00:32:18,549
reputation and I think also working with

725
00:32:18,549 --> 00:32:20,840
third parties that can actually clean

726
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,750
this out it is in this whole ecosystem

727
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:27,200
best interest to keep this clean and not

728
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,750
allowing malicious act so these are very

729
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:32,750
open to reporting malicious ads and

730
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:35,330
malicious creators obviously this

731
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:36,919
content blocking only happens after

732
00:32:36,919 --> 00:32:39,259
somebody else got top you know and they

733
00:32:39,259 --> 00:32:41,210
told them that with malicious injury or

734
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:44,090
like so first time user I don't know but

735
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:46,429
I would say that's like everything I've

736
00:32:46,429 --> 00:32:48,529
read everything I've heard the whole

737
00:32:48,529 --> 00:32:51,169
ecosystem is very supportive up and

738
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:53,420
keeping things clean

739
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:56,150
thank you that looks like a good

740
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:57,950
opportunity for spear fishing

741
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:01,820
I mean you who've been insist to nose up

742
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:04,270
there you can start causing individuals

743
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:07,070
so this was like a good opportunity for

744
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:12,020
spear fishing so think about it right

745
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,370
think about where we went with the

746
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:15,620
credit card industry where we started

747
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,090
out with those that would pop credit

748
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:19,580
cards here and there you know and then

749
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:23,630
they would pop like a large organization

750
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:26,330
and then for a while there we saw folks

751
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:28,180
pop credit card

752
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:31,820
Clearing House you know and then we got

753
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:33,800
these full sales millions and millions

754
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,960
of credit cards got pops right so let's

755
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,490
take that analogy you put it in in

756
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:39,980
infrastructure all right fishing we see

757
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,780
fishing down here right now against

758
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:45,020
individual organization potentially we

759
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,960
feeds a service provider fishing you

760
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,910
know the stealing data for fishing so

761
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:52,310
that we looked at DocuSign had a debt

762
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:54,290
issue within the last few months and

763
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:56,150
they're kind of like a general service

764
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:58,430
provider what happens when these guys

765
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:00,170
get off what happens if they lose their

766
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:03,920
data all right so I'm asking your

767
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,940
question with a question

768
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,740
all right is that something that we have

769
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,418
to prepare for what does it mean when

770
00:34:08,418 --> 00:34:10,969
these guys your pump and recognize like

771
00:34:10,969 --> 00:34:12,710
what are their reporting relationships

772
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:15,679
to let you know and how will I see

773
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,050
efficient camping and that mystery bears

774
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:19,429
out there's a good chance that they may

775
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:21,739
already be for all we done it will do

776
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:22,629
kids for

777
00:34:22,629 --> 00:34:26,109
today you can't track what he does today

778
00:34:26,109 --> 00:34:28,089
you can't track where your data is going

779
00:34:28,089 --> 00:34:30,839
and very challenging you can you can

780
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:33,998
review again all these everybody in this

781
00:34:33,998 --> 00:34:36,190
myth is very transparent about what they

782
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:39,579
collect from you so if you want to read

783
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:41,469
privacy policies and so on you can

784
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:43,839
understand what is being collected

785
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:49,210
but it's challenged yes sir so on I see

786
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:51,129
a business opportunity here for what

787
00:34:51,129 --> 00:34:58,710
monsters that'll do operation

788
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:09,030
so George question looks like there's a

789
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:12,990
business opportunity here right so and

790
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:14,310
there's some funds that are taken

791
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:15,869
advantage of it I think that's exactly

792
00:35:15,869 --> 00:35:19,080
the case but I think our traditional way

793
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,609
of saying I'm just going to block ads

794
00:35:20,609 --> 00:35:24,599
won't work I think if you really wanted

795
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:27,210
to do the tinfoil hat exercise what you

796
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:29,640
would do potentially is presented

797
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,980
different persona each time all right

798
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:34,650
and and be a little bit smarter not just

799
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:36,599
block because if you block ads your

800
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:37,830
Internet experience is going to be

801
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:41,250
miserable all right but if you can do

802
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:45,470
something slightly different now maybe I

803
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:47,310
don't know well I think there's

804
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:49,260
something else here I think just simply

805
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,010
go no-go

806
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:52,530
one ad is pretty much not going to work

807
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:54,510
because you guys are smart enough that

808
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:56,849
they're working around and they can

809
00:35:56,849 --> 00:35:58,710
convince you to turn ads on but to do

810
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:00,359
something different like maybe George

811
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:03,599
has there's 100 different personas in

812
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,840
his browser all right and then and then

813
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,160
privacy isn't so much of a concern

814
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,410
because it's really not you it's kind of

815
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:14,540
you know your doppelganger

816
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,980
and the question

817
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:24,050
yes so how does how do I identify a meat

818
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:27,920
selling data about their users so how do

819
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,570
I add feed selling data about their

820
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:31,280
users fit into all that that's a great

821
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,960
question that's related to the recent

822
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,900
change by by the administration and

823
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,540
allows ISPs to kind of get into this mix

824
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:40,310
I don't know all right

825
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:43,520
I think it's kind of scary actually in

826
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,080
putting this together I've worked a lot

827
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:48,530
with our marketing group non-technical

828
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:50,330
folks currently digital marketing group

829
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:52,820
who on one hand really love this

830
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,410
infrastructure because they can really

831
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:56,780
target their advertising and make very

832
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,850
effective advertising decisions and on

833
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:01,450
the other hand they're the people that

834
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:04,400
always add the up surf the internet with

835
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,440
private mode on turn off all their

836
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,270
cookies delete it because it's just

837
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:10,760
plain creepy all right there's a people

838
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,710
that first told me about the

839
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:13,910
administration to change the balance

840
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:17,060
ISPs being able to sell advertising so

841
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,070
if you think about it and again to my

842
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,200
point of not being able to separate

843
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:26,270
yourself if your ISP now sells or you

844
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:28,480
know allow or share some information

845
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,460
into the infrastructure about your

846
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,310
address about where you're coming from

847
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:36,500
that feels a little bit more creepy and

848
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,150
marketing even hoping that yeah that

849
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:41,360
feels kind kind of creepy right and that

850
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,520
is that's very different from how it's

851
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,220
handled into Europe in Europe as well I

852
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:48,260
think it may be because we just start

853
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:51,500
paying them for this much attention part

854
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,100
of my point of thought to do today

855
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,759
yes

856
00:38:05,369 --> 00:38:09,119
so once I said I kind of stay in

857
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,559
departments that you really can't break

858
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:13,589
this flex can't you run some polls that

859
00:38:13,589 --> 00:38:18,690
actually block at so on we actually work

860
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:20,609
a lot of this I like to think that that

861
00:38:20,609 --> 00:38:23,779
with our we like so at a corporate level

862
00:38:23,779 --> 00:38:28,440
we do content management I think most

863
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,269
firms do that nowadays to prevent

864
00:38:30,269 --> 00:38:32,400
content and you can use your corporate

865
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,979
content management the block ads as a

866
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:38,460
specific category we actually have a lot

867
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:41,279
of business problems when we block ads

868
00:38:41,279 --> 00:38:43,680
there's a lot of legitimate content that

869
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,930
people want to do research on that they

870
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:48,299
can't get to when we've blocked them at

871
00:38:48,299 --> 00:38:50,369
the corporate level so although you can

872
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:52,920
turn off a lot of this at the corporate

873
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,779
level then you're also going to impact

874
00:38:54,779 --> 00:38:56,420
our ability to get the published content

875
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:59,160
but that's the challenge that's the put

876
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,319
poll that happens that can you do it

877
00:39:01,319 --> 00:39:03,299
yeah do you want to do it no potentially

878
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:06,059
you could all right but you're not going

879
00:39:06,059 --> 00:39:07,829
to get as rich of content because that's

880
00:39:07,829 --> 00:39:11,609
of supporting this whole ecosystem yes

881
00:39:11,609 --> 00:39:15,410
what like the

882
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:28,950
without that so it feels like in order

883
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,599
to do this you can go to the native

884
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:34,890
management platform yeah baby good luck

885
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:39,020
right and again this is this is a whole

886
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:42,240
huge monetary ecosystem

887
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,420
this is advertising but you are takes

888
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,550
down what you have to do is makes levels

889
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:49,260
that make it less effective and that's

890
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,450
what maybe maybe there's a new improved

891
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:53,520
ad blocker that lets down there that

892
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,369
makes that less effective for us but not

893
00:39:56,369 --> 00:39:59,579
for others longer interesting John I

894
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:01,740
don't have solutions for this right I

895
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,240
just want to make this evidence to you

896
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,369
and also I want to state that that

897
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:07,859
please don't take my statements as

898
00:40:07,859 --> 00:40:10,859
authoritative take them as informative

899
00:40:10,859 --> 00:40:13,920
and it takes them away and do some some

900
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,440
looking into this area look at it from a

901
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,480
privacy standpoint look at it from a

902
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,119
security standpoint again this is very

903
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,460
very transparent they're really letting

904
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:26,010
us know what they're doing I think we're

905
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:28,230
not paying a lot of attention to all

906
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:29,550
right so I'd encourage you to take a

907
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:31,050
look at this and take it home and see if

908
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:33,540
you can build a better ad blocker build

909
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,119
a better content management platform

910
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,700
feel better privacy logic into the way

911
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,930
that you present your Julie

912
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:44,390
right with that I believe my time is up

913
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:47,000
so I unfortunately have to get back to

914
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,600
the office

915
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:55,799
[Applause]
