1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,120
I like you Dan client

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,580
dan is a most important and you're the

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,820
founder effect size are you not what one

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,280
of the funds whispered besides and damn

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,599
[Applause]

6
00:00:21,769 --> 00:00:24,210
if you can all again Oh

7
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,150
Oberlin and Dan is also the recipient of

8
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,390
the prize black badge the very first one

9
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,739
I won in 2010 half this because he lost

10
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:39,629
the third one the beginning did y'all

11
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:43,500
you're looking good and or damn like all

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,020
of your kids hilltop right is it going

13
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,149
to work on the data in fact is a bullet

14
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:51,059
village researcher at cert just like the

15
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:53,250
hills and we've now just ignited upon as

16
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:59,129
a DC of reading on any reunion it is

17
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:03,649
when I serve everyday Monday slinky you

18
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:09,710
putting John that's sure right

19
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:13,770
okay I know reason he put a root beer

20
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,869
all day I'm going to throw a bunch of

21
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:19,430
have to decimal nickname on that too so

22
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:23,759
yeah okay that's a good thing okay group

23
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,930
and you can turn a few disclaimers I'm

24
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,520
going to talk about coming over to needs

25
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,979
and keeping engine systems or real needs

26
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,170
are public as a get correct

27
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,490
and public Stamatakis so hoping that you

28
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,430
do raise your secret sauce here long

29
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,110
doing the issue doesn't talk at all

30
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,799
depicts so those other products at home

31
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:49,020
and all the information on the pop on is

32
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,869
available in public documents like

33
00:01:50,869 --> 00:01:53,640
manuals and things like that so a lot

34
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,090
centers there are no zero day awesome

35
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,799
speaker copier Odyssey so by the organ

36
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,670
complete telematics and interesting area

37
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,829
because the supply chain is very complex

38
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:09,979
so normally loner abilities

39
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:11,569
we get coming in as a buffer overflow

40
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:13,720
and some piece of software or whatever

41
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,030
this date it's not clear really where $2

42
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,709
billion lies because you haven't blew em

43
00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:21,080
until the device will be programmed by

44
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,599
an integrator and sold by a carrier

45
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,060
reseller so this is well supply chain

46
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,760
it's not as obvious we need even pops we

47
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,849
get more little fixed we have to quite a

48
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:33,500
few weeks of trying time to record some

49
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,760
swap to give you tips to it so that's

50
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,200
what are you legal right it's what are

51
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,790
they tell that there are lots of

52
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,950
organizations that use clean Colorado

53
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:50,620
solutions that you work for do sleeves

54
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,849
so it's the examples are long-haul

55
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:55,129
trucking or will the delivery whether

56
00:02:55,129 --> 00:02:57,230
it's you know the people I are the floor

57
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:00,859
top or whatever law enforcement Public

58
00:03:00,859 --> 00:03:02,060
Safety or fire trucks ambulances

59
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,609
obviously service providers and

60
00:03:04,609 --> 00:03:06,859
contractors us in terms of like training

61
00:03:06,859 --> 00:03:08,780
air conditioning Depot driving around

62
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,780
events initial days I'm seeing a lot of

63
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,810
became less arts resynthesizing and

64
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,790
first military is a lot of heat to

65
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:21,169
vehicles so the point of some has any

66
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:23,989
vehicles is able to a lot of it is the

67
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:25,970
ability or track their vehicles in their

68
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,590
fleet know where you're going wondering

69
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:30,980
at the door its mark on it whatever

70
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,010
reason to - mileage and means and

71
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:37,190
patient into that well to this example

72
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,049
you can look at key minitor look at your

73
00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:41,180
cars and say okay now there were always

74
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,359
where they all are not going to want a

75
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:46,010
bunch we probably around the church

76
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:50,500
boomers their needles closest patients

77
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,819
but this is really a table by the fact

78
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:54,590
that there will be very cheap telematics

79
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,359
money think again on the cars these days

80
00:03:56,359 --> 00:03:59,510
a lot of the plug directly in the obd2

81
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,879
port which is required on all parts now

82
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:05,510
McCaw since 1996 this is what a fairly

83
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,190
complicated one over there to talk about

84
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,889
this one a lot but up I'm gone wound off

85
00:04:09,889 --> 00:04:13,609
of ebay for ten dollars is the serial

86
00:04:13,609 --> 00:04:15,410
port connections within lesson here

87
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:18,019
- super people super Chiefs and that's

88
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:19,850
really encouraging lot of people to use

89
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:24,110
these devices more Caucasian that still

90
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,610
very cheap there's must've been actually

91
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,230
a third wire into cars these are more

92
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:29,720
used for more for trucks

93
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,670
please stay in valence people but that

94
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:36,350
is a little bit more functionality so

95
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,060
what we've done is we will do a lot of

96
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,250
needs and what we found is there's a

97
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,110
total of common border region such as

98
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,210
realizes that you're Asian can pretend

99
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:46,490
rocks Trafalgar definitely security of

100
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,770
the universe I'm going on all the one to

101
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:52,520
look that you found out common things so

102
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,070
we turn organization so you can connect

103
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,590
winning devices via Wi-Fi to the room

104
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,080
actual one two three four two hundred

105
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,860
meters away no encryption of an off so

106
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,960
area medically they're using as a cell

107
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,540
to do anything or anything a cell on the

108
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,890
bottom one thing correctly so handle it

109
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,660
unplanned further updates is he more the

110
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,090
standard than anything else like time

111
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:19,340
very very seeing people timer former

112
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:23,690
agency biases oxygen idea on gorilla the

113
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,270
main point into these are that group

114
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,430
back to us here marketing these necks

115
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,820
that leads you were just a loop in here

116
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,610
- no cars that's connected directly to

117
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,560
networking are called canvas it's

118
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,480
connected to our google mods will

119
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,420
binding for logical for Lux parade

120
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:44,390
experience of I know the other a minute

121
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:47,450
centric in a piece of popular manages

122
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:49,190
the buzz of them to talk about their

123
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,240
actually a little bit better than some

124
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,470
of the ones I've looked at but there are

125
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:53,180
some words need to talk about watch the

126
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:58,460
polygon consent as well so I think that

127
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,900
we'll talk about today instead of our

128
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,520
communication so about study we're going

129
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,200
to go into those little isolations

130
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,780
neutral never known problems earlier

131
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:10,220
that we learn communication so the world

132
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,620
of older brother calls to say like get

133
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,480
them they don't edit a TV station power

134
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,440
detecting to on and worse than that most

135
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,210
of I think the that we are more

136
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:23,210
than happy to down Dre from liver or

137
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,880
both others need to get them so they

138
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,530
drew Johnson tower says I'm sorry is

139
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:28,730
beginning

140
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:31,250
lighting state okay well I'd rather have

141
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:36,200
something productive and fingers often

142
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,610
errs meet Darrell encryption almost

143
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,190
those many patients they say that it is

144
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,960
any better than that they're mandating

145
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,420
certain levels of encryption but in

146
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,920
other countries it's not so good so we

147
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,050
work our big international

148
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,240
meetings and sugar netting vehicles

149
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,400
about the word Mexico or something you

150
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,620
know if they're using is $14 in fact

151
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,270
even it helps which is kind of

152
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,050
occurrence

153
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,270
you know cellular standards and provide

154
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,790
you comes out location trapping is often

155
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,890
a lot of really good papers on this we

156
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:09,470
can track education and down from within

157
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:13,150
a square longer so radio translation so

158
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,470
we're gonna get any better than that

159
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:19,010
these places without so there's known

160
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,380
problems already suffer another area

161
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:25,910
skipping so far and how people do things

162
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,730
to cellular of probably all you learn PC

163
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:31,340
captures or one of the brain names and

164
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:34,700
stingrays so complete and other not so

165
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,940
great people

166
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:40,340
sounds like that was facilities with not

167
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:44,150
so many people please but also people

168
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:47,810
that are not as being forgiven you Cindy

169
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,940
catchers to grass help them it makes

170
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,440
gonna be what I just described which is

171
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,930
the Chinese oh no I don't speak GSN are

172
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,340
going to need to downgrade and talk to

173
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,860
me that way and guess what happened talk

174
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,260
to you now effective base station so

175
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,090
they can grab most it's not all

176
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:06,080
information so is that if you set up a

177
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,790
little sign your lap and we go through

178
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,920
this real quick because new lock on

179
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,160
lines them probably this is not less

180
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,250
interesting thing but uh so we have no

181
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,010
cellular lab this is a very tense when

182
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:21,170
you simply block out all our missions in

183
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,510
your house and when the office is going

184
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:27,710
to be a choice and cozy emeritus and

185
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:30,620
Christmas all you can stuff going on but

186
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,690
basically this is our road supplement

187
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:36,110
our week eight of a whose power supply

188
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:38,929
there something find radio and stuff but

189
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:40,400
with this we can emulate stay in

190
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,240
eighteen t power

191
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:46,470
so basically how this works one more

192
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:50,220
cell phones I mean nobody vaccines

193
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,850
you're undertaking

194
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,160
okay social 1202 text is awkward by

195
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,200
radio which has been pre-configured to

196
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,700
do so they were rid of communications

197
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,280
console laptops or analytics some

198
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,440
software or open BTS which allows you to

199
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,990
emulate cellular communications and ask

200
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:10,380
us for the boost abroad keep ours this

201
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,150
is a little glimpse of what it can be

202
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,710
test looks like keeping configurate

203
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,900
pattern whatever identity you want kind

204
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,310
of the important thing down here down

205
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,990
the bottom there's a red square system

206
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,700
on cellular networks we call your

207
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,890
network where everyone well 18 feet and

208
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:25,050
any phone is looking for a CT we're

209
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:27,680
trying to cancel that like I said if you

210
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,030
downgraded to GSM it's not going to

211
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:33,110
bother son welcome to the base station

212
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:37,650
this example adding a body client to LA

213
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:43,410
o PDGF so when I don't want your device

214
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:44,730
be the first thing I want to do is I

215
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,110
want to find out what the phone number

216
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,870
is genetics things a lot easier so

217
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,790
you're stuck way to do this something

218
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,190
called the impeded international mobile

219
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:57,450
subscriber identity um which the Vice

220
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:59,700
can broadcast or starts up so this

221
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,830
population gravity to see if you're

222
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,570
lucky please read on the same carbon a

223
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,400
bone we're going to license overtopping

224
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,120
dot and it might be encrypted in the

225
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,560
cartoon in which case you just pick up

226
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,540
with me open each a Sandra ten cars are

227
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,340
talking about and you can th see because

228
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,410
it has to broadcast that tower to the

229
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:19,850
first comes up after you get the empty

230
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:21,980
look like this

231
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:27,750
hope you like is much reliance so he

232
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,640
looks something like this it breaks down

233
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,100
to something like this the first three

234
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,930
digits of the funky code second three or

235
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,760
the network coding the lastest phone

236
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,760
number get your lucky so that happens

237
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,820
sometimes you've got one problem problem

238
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,510
is mobile mobile number portability

239
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,550
stated fifteen years ago or so and

240
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,020
Watson you move your cell phone numbers

241
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:49,610
different

242
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,800
years actually what it means you can

243
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,540
move with Oh number two different SIM

244
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,029
cards and so therefore the inky which

245
00:10:56,029 --> 00:10:58,670
you get data for only two phone number

246
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,980
of gasser advice I'd only run a process

247
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,870
once anymore advices I think that's

248
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,060
mostly because they're manufactured to

249
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,829
just be darkest old movie carry the

250
00:11:06,829 --> 00:11:08,660
phone number is fairly sometimes itself

251
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,010
under different changing phones every

252
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:13,579
time rises good deal whatever but if you

253
00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:15,649
do run it it there's a few ways around

254
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:17,750
it you can actually pay and just look up

255
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:21,380
the India in the attic of the providers

256
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,670
have to move doesn't buy access

257
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:26,089
databases a lower spaces you can get a

258
00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:28,810
general idea of what phone number range

259
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:32,420
device is in Central Texas sir

260
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,130
description text every device and in

261
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:40,190
bondage children okay so it's a little

262
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:44,390
morbid Norris examples see also find all

263
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:46,220
devices we want to start dissecting it

264
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,350
see how what are dairy so first thing

265
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,000
what I'd wanted to do if I want to look

266
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,029
for serial crackpot advice and so the

267
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:55,640
little white hanging here on the screen

268
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:59,420
that's a stereo her face and on the way

269
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,670
tied all that mess is because the serial

270
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:04,010
cable eccentric in Parker but I had to

271
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:06,350
cut up in the tragedy figuring out

272
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,880
something vicious I got a serial signal

273
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,560
office well

274
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,720
serial traffic is it's really easy to

275
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,120
identify oscilloscope because zero

276
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,130
traffic and all zeros are one either

277
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:18,860
maximum or minimum voltage so when you

278
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,420
see a square waveform like this it's

279
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:23,500
really easy that's zero input or output

280
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,820
your time to be going up and down to

281
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,160
zero one zero one two long ones or GG

282
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,699
with the road for example so little pins

283
00:12:31,699 --> 00:12:33,949
on a no interfaces I'm atmosphere

284
00:12:33,949 --> 00:12:36,800
package once I got that I found out they

285
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,040
do cannot wait to the once then disabled

286
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,680
legally he can access the serial input

287
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,290
do anything Gretna Green from which is

288
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,149
fine it was all kind of debugging which

289
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:50,120
is be done to the serial port also

290
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,279
suggested moving up very interesting

291
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:54,560
what's more interesting invented is that

292
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,000
a whole bunch of information about how

293
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,609
is connected

294
00:12:57,609 --> 00:13:02,209
so uh this tops red circle appearances

295
00:13:02,209 --> 00:13:05,029
ATP's eroding water for people that are

296
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:07,489
old like me remember that Mullins you

297
00:13:07,489 --> 00:13:09,559
keep it simple gating pancetta to talk

298
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:12,829
things out siren stupid same thing

299
00:13:12,829 --> 00:13:14,929
well I'm fair that Mike's been looking

300
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:17,539
at again later although further down

301
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:19,569
here there is the 18th and pong phenom

302
00:13:19,569 --> 00:13:22,519
ii r interval that's just a number of

303
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:25,429
the bikes so that was really easy i just

304
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:26,989
have to listen to the serial cracker but

305
00:13:26,989 --> 00:13:29,749
buzz competin something well and then

306
00:13:29,749 --> 00:13:31,159
the lectures that you can see down here

307
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:33,289
this is what rotations if you can read

308
00:13:33,289 --> 00:13:35,269
it where you can see it does not happen

309
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:39,049
cell phone number written as you see

310
00:13:39,049 --> 00:13:40,579
here it also gave me not lots of useful

311
00:13:40,579 --> 00:13:42,470
information about the IP configuration

312
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,979
knows what the units are proceeding once

313
00:13:44,979 --> 00:13:48,169
ask forgiveness you didn't run them

314
00:13:48,169 --> 00:13:50,569
passwords without being able bunch of

315
00:13:50,569 --> 00:13:55,069
information enemies so that was really

316
00:13:55,069 --> 00:13:57,259
useful on one device that i got you know

317
00:13:57,259 --> 00:13:59,479
all this awesome stuff i'm serum next

318
00:13:59,479 --> 00:14:00,949
one I thought unfortunately they had

319
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:03,350
disabled L debugging information in

320
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:06,679
serial ports so then I thought nah not

321
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,769
even electrical signals of telescope I

322
00:14:09,769 --> 00:14:12,049
was like okay well how can I get a

323
00:14:12,049 --> 00:14:13,819
destination especially the senator

324
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:16,729
communications information so the

325
00:14:16,729 --> 00:14:18,559
information is coming from a cellular

326
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:21,889
modem has to be controlled by a

327
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:22,909
microcontroller

328
00:14:22,909 --> 00:14:27,470
hoping the CPU on device also able to

329
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:30,939
the orders on and a house

330
00:14:30,939 --> 00:14:33,139
microcontroller on the board translating

331
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:37,059
that serial information to a modem ATP

332
00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:39,409
fortunately there is a to not with this

333
00:14:39,409 --> 00:14:42,649
exact room after the Internet so I could

334
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:45,319
look at that out cut periodic pins on it

335
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:47,929
words serial interface at a nice little

336
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:49,669
chart for me and gave a few different

337
00:14:49,669 --> 00:14:52,489
options they said rx only transmit and

338
00:14:52,489 --> 00:14:53,899
receive something like okay there's

339
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:56,269
probably serial pins so that narrowed it

340
00:14:56,269 --> 00:14:58,329
down a little bit

341
00:14:58,329 --> 00:15:00,919
termite I suppose go back and look at

342
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:02,659
those pins i power likely and power

343
00:15:02,659 --> 00:15:05,720
through the reduce real traffic so I had

344
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,269
pretty good candidates for what painting

345
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:09,260
on this

346
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,900
Motum shift we're doing serial fire to

347
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:17,060
microcontroller so that governor is

348
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,980
going to if I don't logic analyzer it

349
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:22,130
means but the problems long we had this

350
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,850
is untrue Campylobacter so this is the

351
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,710
best picture anything which you can trim

352
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,900
it but basically there's bad role on the

353
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,180
outside of loading identify ones that I

354
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,280
bought with the serial in half and my

355
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,150
controller in Sony book rooms on those

356
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,220
two if the electrical signals off of

357
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,490
them connection to the logic analyzer I

358
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:45,500
tried some pretty fertile book on me you

359
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,410
see inter event in ground in time I'm

360
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:53,960
not acquitted but by one a time but this

361
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,710
is the logic analyzer and old screenshot

362
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:00,080
below under conditions you see his

363
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,730
waveform which is similar to the stereo

364
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,980
waveform that you saw before of a deluxe

365
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,630
analyzer knows what does it actually

366
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:08,270
need protection premium the a few values

367
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:11,510
beams waveforms and data by this is

368
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:14,060
actually just like a test program they

369
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,940
see the numbers are bugging for here and

370
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,700
then over here and take because the

371
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,460
diplomas to correct protocol and shows

372
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:27,530
you what information is coming along so

373
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:29,540
why I end up with a bunch of columns of

374
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,480
numbers like this and not you gonna be

375
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,790
ready to like top to bottom in the next

376
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:40,030
column top to bottom on three again so

377
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:45,860
what we need UMP out at me is in this

378
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:48,560
first column we have these are red

379
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,290
letters we see the thing that is on the

380
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:53,810
Syrian people for write 80 e 0e months

381
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,610
or started selling depreciation there

382
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:59,270
see them in and out here later I have to

383
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:01,520
the couldn't do printed receipt and time

384
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,350
again supposed to come across or

385
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:05,720
Lincoln's eventually came up with black

386
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:10,069
that uh it wasn't commands just a motive

387
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:11,690
and everything it just one word out of

388
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,250
here Givaudan alright

389
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:16,400
broke out into a bunch of numbers I

390
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,870
don't know they need an opponent

391
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:23,410
so once again had a phone number this is

392
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,000
kind of a complicated way of doing it

393
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,460
and why does not have repellers have a

394
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,470
bunch of production yarn go into it

395
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,970
then turn your phone number off the

396
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:34,960
board but that's not the right number

397
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,400
but once it is my party with the

398
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:43,690
positive only I sent us so I think if I

399
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:46,090
watch it all the car music internet so

400
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:47,910
it's like plug in under that rope

401
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:51,340
attended a text message thankfully the

402
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:55,240
only head manual it happens doesn't it

403
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,950
or even neediness and that's interface

404
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,980
to Nevada stock I was going 34 down the

405
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,540
bottom this little part and see minute

406
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:05,140
is what Quneitra put a silver note

407
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,970
request to advise or reprogram

408
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:15,420
foreigners they can be at ease because

409
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:22,150
there's no password oh this is my phone

410
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:25,140
I'm sending commands to the device and

411
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,430
it happens in two back bunch of

412
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,590
information some of which is more

413
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:31,390
interesting than the other like driving

414
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:36,040
time here but you know we've seen a

415
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,840
patient out perhaps you can't afford a

416
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,750
car as well as the heading and the speed

417
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,840
of the problem so we put some number and

418
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,090
then what are the devices in I can put

419
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:47,800
their texted all dating it back you can

420
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,140
score top tilde where is that they're

421
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:56,260
not party time at but I think it's

422
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,330
information that we might go to legends

423
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:04,570
amongst this so once your basic SMS

424
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:07,990
configuration trans on I found special

425
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:11,320
set evening click password you can set

426
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,750
IP address here in third command and

427
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,270
that racing the firewall and this IP

428
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,860
address is allowed to connects to this

429
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:21,120
advice that seemed pretty useful of

430
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,710
important device what is on that's

431
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:24,370
pretty awesome

432
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:26,680
so this place I can send text messages

433
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,750
of doing most administrative functions

434
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,110
on this device

435
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,760
that's pretty awesome I'm pretty happy

436
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,190
with that but whatever I want to do is

437
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,480
hang IP connections because that's

438
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,040
that's nice to just you know sometimes

439
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,720
your scheme image delay and we're going

440
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,809
downward North has ongoing the tcp/ip

441
00:19:41,809 --> 00:19:44,150
connection in this case media attention

442
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,130
to the denying selectors

443
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:50,270
it didn't hurt there a lot performance

444
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,370
of carriers blocking down access so we

445
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:54,590
can't generally under photo or any

446
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,360
gender study of the bodies we can't make

447
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,160
it inbound connection to a key key key

448
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,679
for our UDP port this is one of the

449
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:02,120
problems with the key factors and found

450
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,549
that there's this open port and smeared

451
00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:06,049
network and other sprint phone and at

452
00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:09,350
least 2 X 2 at Forbes spur to success is

453
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:14,059
that an ATT prospect identity um so

454
00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:15,830
there are made who they're blocking any

455
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:18,350
non connection but it's not Easter

456
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,500
different so it is a documentation I

457
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,500
found the school David said be looking

458
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,780
at these two specifically for the IP

459
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:29,059
addresses the Weiss will deliver

460
00:20:29,059 --> 00:20:30,860
maintenance messages to importance

461
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:35,330
entity already create me connection

462
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:37,220
actually I think that I hope IP address

463
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:43,580
is that um and indeed under see to that

464
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,260
with a little right hand corner is red

465
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:48,020
box and IP address in Turks with it I am

466
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,150
in front with that means nations and

467
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,559
this is after I've already set the

468
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:53,030
maintenance server for this particular

469
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:57,679
device to be my IP address on a CMU key

470
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:03,110
phase like okay so SF IP address to be

471
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:06,919
amazing server that around so I've ever

472
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:08,690
units being old specials on the server

473
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:12,620
and on this other parameter that I

474
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,480
consented is how often we means that's

475
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,049
an essentially it's server until what

476
00:21:18,049 --> 00:21:21,410
we're doing essentially by 300,000

477
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:24,230
second ridiculous

478
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:26,720
ah a little pay that's kind of a

479
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,400
negative go ahead line so I start out

480
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,340
here I'm sending a text command just to

481
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,290
see what the current settings are you

482
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:35,270
can see that the main server is

483
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:38,240
currently hot an address that's in ESS

484
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,360
previously query I ask what the border

485
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,280
this was an on talking about

486
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,440
as Senator the number commandant say

487
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,030
that they would set the maintenance

488
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:52,160
message interval 270x to 120 seconds so

489
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,650
I want to wait the line bear by to that

490
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:58,670
so it did um and then I have set the IP

491
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:01,570
address to encourage addresses use PHP

492
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,340
the only tricky part not abbas i it

493
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,920
takes a 32 bit in front of it so i have

494
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,430
to convert my kiddos to have dozens of

495
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:13,490
networking 101 so thankfully you will be

496
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:15,110
able to do that even if you will be

497
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:17,900
inverted so did that the doors to see

498
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,180
and to get to see be covered and

499
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:22,280
figuration ensure that you can see it

500
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,830
from here down there has changed the IP

501
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,630
address it's now trying to talk to my

502
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:29,840
teachers so instead of candy little neck

503
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,720
pack on my laptop and so it's listen on

504
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,640
that Forks a wait for a bit longer than

505
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,040
two minutes and i get your candy message

506
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:41,090
back but for the body saying at another

507
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:43,010
country areas to mean I don't care

508
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:47,540
economy key connection right so I was

509
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,080
okay

510
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,610
I need to send and you can keep a

511
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:51,110
kickback to it and see if it will

512
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:53,510
actually do something what they need to

513
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:55,370
pack so the natives to started

514
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:57,500
respecting administrative traffic on

515
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,300
that court but they probably just use

516
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:02,270
the same code just pushing any EP packet

517
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:05,930
comes in from singing functions right if

518
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:07,790
I look at this first I would like I'm

519
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,980
getting I don't know that's worth a lot

520
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,260
I'll subtract them to figure out but

521
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,390
thankfully all this first chunk down

522
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:17,000
here are the options and they are backed

523
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,820
up so really the only thing I have to

524
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,830
worry about is the message header and

525
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:24,080
message content world of those bad with

526
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,140
the pants okay

527
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:30,800
okay so be real I don't really a kit

528
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,540
that should conforms me mister and

529
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:36,200
protocol of that about students to

530
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,750
motivate advice first one is just

531
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,010
because I have to set the most

532
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:43,610
significant bit and first night or at

533
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:46,400
all thanks s if you're a zero because

534
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,800
it's an unacknowledged request I was

535
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,150
just getting this I was like I've got

536
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:52,780
one or two chance I'll try down first

537
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,770
we're right here

538
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:56,900
seven I'm studying it to admit request

539
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,450
message we've seen what most likely

540
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:01,100
thing where I didn't know anything about

541
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,450
the Devon so you could send your

542
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:03,340
requests

543
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:07,010
thankfully that worked out next student

544
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:09,800
budget at started at age as a sequence

545
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,660
number it's totally arbitrary since

546
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:14,570
whatever has track sessions as 25

547
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:17,330
messages to that record and five others

548
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:20,650
to 0-2 which makes an augmentation

549
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:23,560
disease Union request message that

550
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,820
determines a version reports in an

551
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:28,430
accent that if you want about the most

552
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:30,080
patient has another possibly said in

553
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:34,220
back to advise on an old zero just

554
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:37,820
require pattern so I made this little

555
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:41,060
text file how that it is in binary

556
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,850
why are not met Pat again until it in

557
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,170
this case to looking on the port but

558
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:47,120
also to the first time I get the message

559
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,790
to send back what Ivan is created in my

560
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:52,220
mood five it is hopefully back it's

561
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,980
useful so when I first came back is the

562
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,510
staining message before were house stuff

563
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:59,780
like it works we understand it sends

564
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,220
back the message which I've divided over

565
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:04,340
TCP dump or a second layer whatever I

566
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,380
get this different message it should be

567
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,930
at version and the serial number on my

568
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:11,990
new GPS reinsert

569
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:15,590
taking so now I have a whole

570
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:18,260
back-and-forth EDD connection to device

571
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:21,290
and this race commands to deflect who's

572
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:23,060
our workable firewall blocking me from

573
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:28,670
doing so got it so we're almost there

574
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,770
not administrative access to the device

575
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:33,920
either with us mess or to submit key

576
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,670
great awesome but the only remaining

577
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:41,030
problem of the pattern let's see is this

578
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:43,730
the messages the can't ethically which

579
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:45,890
those are the messages to get sent on

580
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:47,540
from Carter's box to receive information

581
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:50,150
they're hard coded in the attitude

582
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:53,480
that's on these slices so their spectra

583
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,920
control only get a lot of information

584
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,230
from the park so for example the bottom

585
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:59,930
with typical will be e to from the end

586
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:01,990
they can retain at my news or whatever

587
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:03,429
7000 ones

588
00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:05,529
that'd just be different speech here's

589
00:26:05,529 --> 00:26:07,929
you know those are hard coded plus

590
00:26:07,929 --> 00:26:11,259
winged horses one Wow in so it's kind of

591
00:26:11,259 --> 00:26:14,019
cool to the other son it information get

592
00:26:14,019 --> 00:26:15,519
back on the currency book I want to do

593
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:17,469
is send can messages of my whole bunch

594
00:26:17,469 --> 00:26:22,059
of the cockles right so next question is

595
00:26:22,059 --> 00:26:24,729
can modified firmware civil send what I

596
00:26:24,729 --> 00:26:26,589
wanted to instead of what looks intended

597
00:26:26,589 --> 00:26:31,899
to do so the top here just II its

598
00:26:31,899 --> 00:26:35,950
message up here but pulled out a little

599
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:37,869
bit more this is a text message that

600
00:26:37,869 --> 00:26:39,969
could send it will long to do this if

601
00:26:39,969 --> 00:26:43,929
it's in system represented text message

602
00:26:43,929 --> 00:26:46,389
that is update the firmware here's the

603
00:26:46,389 --> 00:26:48,009
version I want you updates you and

604
00:26:48,009 --> 00:26:52,830
here's the arbitrary URL to Fort Ord

605
00:26:53,429 --> 00:26:57,279
pretty rule and the screen you can kind

606
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,779
of see it gets another double action

607
00:26:58,779 --> 00:27:00,639
downloads as well otherwise you have to

608
00:27:00,639 --> 00:27:03,279
call it a doctor our file is not about

609
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:08,109
300 or worse download file installs it

610
00:27:08,109 --> 00:27:11,440
that's great look that right now all I'm

611
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,779
doing is I'm installing the listing

612
00:27:13,779 --> 00:27:16,179
versions of firmware and on at lunch

613
00:27:16,179 --> 00:27:17,469
just to see if I can tell it what you

614
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:22,509
are out together so next question is

615
00:27:22,509 --> 00:27:24,279
okay I've been tell it to craft firmware

616
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:26,409
from the arbitrary URL clinics modified

617
00:27:26,409 --> 00:27:29,049
firmware until to grab my project from

618
00:27:29,049 --> 00:27:32,859
Florida I look at the binary the ends of

619
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:35,109
look do look very random so who was

620
00:27:35,109 --> 00:27:37,389
digitally sign the digital signatures

621
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:38,830
usually on either end of it and it's

622
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:44,349
pretty random it looks very well so I

623
00:27:44,349 --> 00:27:46,330
changed my one character in it truck

624
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:48,369
that was my third I change and I got

625
00:27:48,369 --> 00:27:51,639
this image CRC failure okay let's check

626
00:27:51,639 --> 00:27:53,769
some problem like it will expecting to

627
00:27:53,769 --> 00:27:55,269
check something somebody will be right

628
00:27:55,269 --> 00:28:00,129
so multi promote load so okay we're

629
00:28:00,129 --> 00:28:02,320
check some Cod perfect rafter you should

630
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,509
be that hard to modify my first generate

631
00:28:04,509 --> 00:28:06,009
new checks comments and if you check

632
00:28:06,009 --> 00:28:10,089
something with Department and yes look

633
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:11,769
at that hard yet it was that hard

634
00:28:11,769 --> 00:28:14,570
because my organized

635
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:18,320
idiots and we assumed it was a crc32

636
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,330
code because nobody else was using the

637
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:23,600
outlaw years until two days trying to

638
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,490
write Python scripts to generate the

639
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:28,250
crc32 build a rocket anywhere in the

640
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,170
find another yeah they didn't system

641
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:32,210
uses here some 16 codes we could try

642
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:32,480
that

643
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,330
and it's our little finance their

644
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:38,450
comment like two centers this is like if

645
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,370
you do the Serie C calculation of the

646
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:43,420
file one too late to the end end of it

647
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:46,040
c16 median if you look at the very end

648
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,510
of the liner in fly of the last two

649
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:51,380
points look at this publish we're taking

650
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:55,850
attendance figure out to be check the

651
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:58,970
CRC code so now the latin is designed to

652
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:00,260
change the firmware again i just want to

653
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,550
see if i can actually do it and gets

654
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:03,950
past that fear see check but is

655
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,900
dependent changes straining work right

656
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:09,020
to last when we keep you saving on the

657
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,550
river characters i didn't have any

658
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:12,350
poppers or anything like that didn't

659
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,790
work encountered worker and just want to

660
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:17,210
see my can do modified from Wow

661
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:19,970
I changed it I towards the downloaded I

662
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:22,790
guess patent uh services in the CRC pass

663
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:27,260
crashed so you know that was the former

664
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,060
reduced and bottom you see instead of

665
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,400
operating company is there's potlucks

666
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:36,470
this company three so that's just my

667
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:38,990
decision Springer they're not trying to

668
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:41,840
do anything with it please we can modify

669
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:47,960
the firmware ominous what can we do so I

670
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,880
mean the color would would probably be

671
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,410
you could reverse engineer this firmware

672
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:53,240
and figure out exactly what they're

673
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,010
doing like where the maps are we can

674
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:56,840
messages put your own can messages in

675
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,460
and inside the input but obviously

676
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,740
that's too much work okay this is really

677
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:04,010
a single once you flash memory you can

678
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,560
load them I can worry my own firm works

679
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:11,180
do I want you instead you know me he

680
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:15,890
weeks versus loose again this way you

681
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:17,780
have control over that twice and

682
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:22,040
wherever you want to go so so this is

683
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,680
what can attacker do if they could get

684
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,590
one of these slices they put an infernal

685
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:31,669
slices represent we track food stars in

686
00:30:31,669 --> 00:30:32,320
real-time

687
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,840
Topsy's please please to use these types

688
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,539
of us is not easy specific it necessary

689
00:30:38,539 --> 00:30:41,690
input no sure criminals would love to

690
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:44,419
yes and have a on ability eg IP

691
00:30:44,419 --> 00:30:46,309
connections they can just like Bradley

692
00:30:46,309 --> 00:30:48,260
you guess what it's a tall tree starting

693
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:53,390
area every 112 the heading this or if

694
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:55,159
you're like an evil business you can

695
00:30:55,159 --> 00:30:56,929
plug the editors around some customers

696
00:30:56,929 --> 00:31:00,860
like Gannon equal flower shop wants you

697
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,899
to track your competitors why this

698
00:31:02,899 --> 00:31:04,580
person on the street their flower shop

699
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,260
division week business to me I want to

700
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,760
see decorative deliberate people

701
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,260
government where they stop better

702
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:11,779
attract them you're going to try often

703
00:31:11,779 --> 00:31:14,630
the questions of discount what we're

704
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:16,100
just thought you could potentially each

705
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,929
doubt on the occupants of the vehicles

706
00:31:17,929 --> 00:31:20,360
so the canyon from the vehicle also

707
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,610
talks to buy which is the vehicle

708
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:24,980
infotainment system this is looking at a

709
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,750
microphone that you use to make a

710
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,130
Bluetooth hands-free calls where you

711
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:32,830
driving around so I'd be able to work

712
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:35,240
but you could potentially get access to

713
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,659
you that access simply must oppose the

714
00:31:38,659 --> 00:31:42,649
video signals from backup camera etc so

715
00:31:42,649 --> 00:31:45,860
you could you could each job in Iowa

716
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,299
started this actually is really easy you

717
00:31:47,299 --> 00:31:49,100
had a Chevy Volt we were testing various

718
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,080
things on for a while and I could send

719
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,179
it like it to bring them can packets on

720
00:31:53,179 --> 00:31:57,200
the can bus over to stock so it's really

721
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,990
that such a simple attack you have got

722
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:02,570
the little numbers a bunch of vehicles

723
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:05,450
owned by a competitor or whatever some

724
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:08,480
sort of time to say I pay within beats

725
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,029
this 50 package learner takes you to let

726
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:13,220
Nicky would be able to their time it

727
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:15,559
didn't have so many packs on them you

728
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:17,779
know to do that to a complete if you

729
00:32:17,779 --> 00:32:19,730
guess people's work on December 23rd

730
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:23,390
it's going to have a business impact you

731
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:25,100
get from Walker steel vehicles unlocking

732
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,169
is actually super simple so if you want

733
00:32:27,169 --> 00:32:28,610
to unlock things to steal them to a

734
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:31,070
dirty vehicles the can commands to

735
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:34,580
unlock cars are really basic stealing is

736
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,630
a little more difficult because you have

737
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:37,730
to take the fact that the key is the

738
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:39,160
vehicle that one

739
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:43,390
of any spooky type ignitions think it

740
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:45,250
makes keys India conservators not that

741
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:48,850
it's you control the thing that says did

742
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:50,410
the key on indicator talk so you can

743
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:54,220
stay connected since yes in Bali because

744
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,500
copper James obviously if you possibly

745
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,090
vehicle is or something like that it

746
00:32:58,090 --> 00:32:59,650
imagine if you've decided to shut down

747
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:01,240
whole bunch of tabs at rush hour in

748
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:06,040
attack not so there you can potentially

749
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,110
cause crashes we've all seen the Jeep

750
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:11,620
video they the engine in something you

751
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,990
can get to at least Mysterio drinks like

752
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:16,360
those cars he says crews can photograph

753
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,220
you can keep it controlled spirit of

754
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:23,340
getting air acceleration race not

755
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:26,470
sometimes you know getting towards the

756
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:30,040
more difficult type of attacks if you

757
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:36,840
really want to be on the nectar imagine

758
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:40,300
so there's a lot of things that is

759
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,940
little hundred everybody's people were

760
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:45,700
to buying me a bulk turning the engines

761
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,170
thousands hundreds of pounds of power

762
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:51,400
stoppage about the risks involved so

763
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,930
kind of more of the story of the fact

764
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,430
that it's fun to reverse engineer get

765
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:57,250
less when this is done first welcome

766
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:59,530
using it come back be able they're not

767
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:01,390
part of your corporate network so one of

768
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:02,890
these problems we've had talking to

769
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:06,040
people about this expected weekend whose

770
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,469
are buying it until 82 know where it

771
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:10,719
Carlos they go on by picking up anything

772
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:13,719
by ITR some security just I mean I don't

773
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:17,230
think about how to take cars well if

774
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:19,570
they don't understand that this is my

775
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:22,000
key issue IT people to take on story

776
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,980
from robbers and keep seasons of other

777
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:26,830
important cars they are now part of a

778
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:29,100
difference somebody needs to something

779
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,989
other then also in a complex if I change

780
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:34,929
learning this is basically we've got

781
00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:36,489
whole access to this based on the fact

782
00:34:36,489 --> 00:34:40,060
that there's an SMS ocean with the

783
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,800
original media action box is looking

784
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,080
handy to somebody make sure it in there

785
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,969
people to build out the systems didn't

786
00:34:45,969 --> 00:34:47,379
they talked back it was in there people

787
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:48,790
resold it in

788
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:51,580
that so you have potentially all these

789
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,290
devices have this functionality to

790
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:56,080
duplicate long it's here you can think

791
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,300
about and no it's not

792
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,550
so I'm owner ability innocence like

793
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:03,100
another drug pump or overflow or

794
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,710
anything it's just a configuration that

795
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:08,110
aids wait years long complex supply

796
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:09,940
chain in procurement system and about

797
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:12,370
the world unfortunately this case didn't

798
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:13,690
not on the world because it it's one

799
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:16,930
stop with it so kind of like for to

800
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:20,320
morals and that's takeaways part of your

801
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,140
network in it ultimately doesn't have to

802
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:26,230
be some super sweet hack you know on in

803
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:28,210
place Windows 10

804
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:30,970
antivirus whatever is being that

805
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:33,100
somebody didn't monitor to figure

806
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,540
something you made its way through a

807
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:37,410
little auction without a fix so

808
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:39,820
thankfully we did this the public

809
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,170
editors they were super awesome about

810
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:44,320
fixing it right away so this is the

811
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,340
signal ability

812
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:48,910
sorry optimal baby screaming this won't

813
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:54,940
help anyone so that is it I had comments

814
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,170
couple minutes left

815
00:35:56,170 --> 00:36:10,810
preposterous yes sir yeah so again

816
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:13,840
sixteen interest to that at least autumn

817
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,940
so I work with the manufacture of e+ in

818
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:18,270
the laundry services Randy and they

819
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:20,200
promise with animated that when it

820
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,990
person self a block will turn you from

821
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:28,000
are that limits and since we talked to

822
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,520
them they're now verified and from there

823
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,500
down only further from they've now added

824
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,620
funding to the bottom areas etc so is

825
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:39,250
another layer of configuration it

826
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:42,250
happens after that works people that buy

827
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:44,110
the devices both the systems install

828
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:46,300
them one of the other people but they

829
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,400
have to configure to and so they have

830
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,520
some sort of ongoing process really in

831
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,170
configuration things and that's what

832
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:54,760
dancing us is intended for with

833
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,610
something bigger so now that work would

834
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:58,150
be something

835
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:01,059
put passwords on their interconnection

836
00:37:01,059 --> 00:37:03,819
put passwords on the arrow as ask you

837
00:37:03,819 --> 00:37:08,680
since it is buddy hit into the bottom

838
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,240
that could something to be that students

839
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:14,650

is fun this is when you went through

857
00:38:10,749 --> 00:38:13,059
this beautiful way that could be

858
00:38:13,059 --> 00:38:15,009
regulated that you're going to make

859
00:38:15,009 --> 00:38:17,079

enabled path we should take

861
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:22,630
yeah I mean there's a lot of

862
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:25,029
conversations going on about that this

863
00:38:25,029 --> 00:38:26,109
was partially funded by Department

864
00:38:26,109 --> 00:38:30,089
transportation the aftermarket

865
00:38:30,089 --> 00:38:32,470
especially is really unavailable but

866
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:34,869
easier not easy but you can make their

867
00:38:34,869 --> 00:38:37,539
relations for cars is scarred and they

868
00:38:37,539 --> 00:38:39,730
make some cybersecurity standards and

869
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:40,690
not regulations

870
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:44,529
aftermarket so pretty wide open and then

871
00:38:44,529 --> 00:38:45,789
there's things that is the right to

872
00:38:45,789 --> 00:38:48,220
repair so you buy it

873
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,890
are we actually it's not even being

874
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:52,900
stupid things your car and they even

875
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:56,230
pick out a dirty bubble um so that

876
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:58,739
conversation is happening constantly I

877
00:38:58,739 --> 00:39:00,910
don't even know if I haven't painted up

878
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:03,369
that's where your doesn't want to do

879
00:39:03,369 --> 00:39:03,730
this

880
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:06,950
I think violent

881
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:09,950
I'm trying to clear responsibility to

882
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:12,530
move on to the vendors and main factors

883
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:13,940
and people are buying something to

884
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:16,750
manage repeats do right now I will

885
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:21,200
complete these things but reasons have

886
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,060
you talked a lot of team images oh

887
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,980
that's cool you test these once this is

888
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:29,030
over reason to secure I'm never going to

889
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:34,640
say oh yes that's accurate but I'm going

890
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:42,940
guess there's really be small

891
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:49,570
[Applause]
