00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,070
to be gotten tough and me I got here

28
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,080
group of Poland's and all the folks on

29
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,860
that is its burdens fantastic um so this

30
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,530
mock helps talks with the rest of us I

31
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,240
actually wrote this along with a

32
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,220
colleague of mine and on a mine info bar

33
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,200
we can't be here today he's actually in

34
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,930
London and that we actually worked this

35
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,060
one for sponsors downstairs we're not

36
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,700
here to sell lock it in any way during

37
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,729
this box downstairs the sound pretty

38
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:55,380
hard see where that's their job through

39
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,850
um so um one thing I do is one which is

40
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,829
that it's pretty cool is you get we have

41
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:03,600
like 13 thousand customers so I get to

42
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,860
go around and talk to some of the

43
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,990
biggest security customers or salon

44
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,318
getting on mostly with when I come in

45
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:11,920
we're just talking not really

46
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,599
products so much but about how

47
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,000
organizations can have used the security

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,010
products how their security operation

49
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:21,880
centers work and so we found we were

50
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,709
actually submitting a talk for the sand

51
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:26,050
sock summit which was actually earlier

52
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,780
this week in DC with anybody there at

53
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:32,440
the Sam Fox on their engine well it's

54
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,640
the only other time we've given this

55
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,860
talk is to say there's no duplicates

56
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,459
there um so one of the things we do is

57
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:41,860
travel around the world a lot so I'm one

58
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,940
of those guys that travels almost 100%

59
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,350
and so we thought we would do some of

60
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,560
our experiences make some hypotheses

61
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,209
about some things that we believe that

62
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:54,610
the most advanced security operation

63
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:58,989
centers are doing and just try to prove

64
00:02:58,989 --> 00:03:01,480
or disprove those hypotheses by talking

65
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,519
to some of these very very large

66
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:04,989
organizations which you can't mention

67
00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:06,880
who they are but they're literally the

68
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,720
name brands in many different industries

69
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,989
healthcare computer software online

70
00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:15,819
service provider kind of technology

71
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:20,440
companies defense contractors government

72
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,739
agencies etc so those are the folks we

73
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:25,120
talked to and doing the research for

74
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,709
this pop - to redistrict Care Committee

75
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:34,299
now we always have to put this layers in

76
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:36,370
or doing some caution this isn't a swamp

77
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:40,000
Rock so I'll get there right now um yeah

78
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,260
I don't know going to get down going to

79
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,540
the bottom but if it's Canadian dentist

80
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,579
billing - passionately these molars and

81
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:48,280
foreskin working what's my favorite part

83
00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:54,340
terms of the document a nice job thanks

84
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,510
John for introducing me so I work as

85
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,790
well I've been mostly on my career I was

86
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,769
a security practitioner for about 15

87
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:05,200
years about five years ago or so I moved

88
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,329
over to the dark side and ended up

89
00:04:07,329 --> 00:04:09,280
working at a vendor so don't hold that

90
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,950
against me too much I've been involved

91
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:14,530
pretty much with our been involved a lot

92
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:17,228
of stands over the years side of the BSE

93
00:04:17,228 --> 00:04:19,959
serve and a better mentor for them and

94
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,310
sometimes speak at their at their

95
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:24,190
conferences as well um my buddy Ryan is

96
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,300
not here

97
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,650
he also has a long long background so it

98
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:32,800
isn't as approximate knowledge of

99
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,069
anything so so I'm not here to speak

100
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:38,759
from an ivory tower we just had a unique

101
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:40,900
capability over the last couple of years

102
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,400
to talk to some of these really really

103
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,470
giant organizations and we figure that

104
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,690
if we could pull a few things about what

105
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,150
they're doing successfully to make them

106
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,009
successful and share them with the

107
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:53,409
community - that would be of value so

108
00:04:53,409 --> 00:04:56,050
that's what this is all about mentioned

109
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,810
a couple times not here to sell anything

110
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:01,919
and please feel free to ask questions

111
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,030
interrupt and stop me if you want

112
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:08,740
I'm poppy talk realizing that that that

113
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:13,840
emma dates me I think all right so the

114
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,090
way we're going to we were going to do

115
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,979
this talk is we'll talk a little bit

116
00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:19,780
about some experiences and Padma that

117
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,900
I've had some hypotheses that we came up

118
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,300
with that we try to prove or disprove

119
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,849
how we did that and then kind of do a

120
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:31,900
mythbuster style analysis of those

121
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:36,190
hypotheses so oh yeah this is that this

122
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,590
actually is one of us but it was just

123
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,509
used to make a QQ map loads of

124
00:05:40,509 --> 00:05:42,610
everywhere that I traveled the last few

125
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:46,210
years so it's a little we can do here

126
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:48,250
about a bill for a long time but safe to

127
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,250
say that I'm not I'm not lying about how

128
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,610
far across the world we blind and plus

129
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:56,650
secured you that right so you know if

130
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:00,819
you came out all right so the customers

131
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:03,069
that I generally talk to you like these

132
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:05,289
organizations or everyone from these

133
00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:08,379
giant banks in Hong Kong you said to

134
00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:11,560
these guys you know all of them right so

135
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,270
Brian and I will jump into power

136
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,710
settings and meeting with everybody in

137
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:18,310
this building but very large companies

138
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,050
the very small ones and sometimes a

139
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,449
small one surprised us with the very

140
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:24,340
needs and things they're unique things

141
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:27,849
that they're doing see everything I so

142
00:06:27,849 --> 00:06:30,789
see organizations that are you know

143
00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:32,440
gotta be ok

144
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,310
bought every product is out there right

145
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,620
ten moment agreement together

146
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,810
right at Keens of people who know how to

147
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:42,240
use those products they're able to

148
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,750
detect and prevent pass very quickly in

149
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,970
their environment yeah kind of the

150
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,560
middle of the road folks right I got my

151
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,260
Palo Alto door my fire I and I rely on

152
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,600
that almost exclusively but for the most

153
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,340
part we got this and then and then the

154
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,530
ugly right to just you know I we got a

155
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,030
guy who comes in every two weeks and

156
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,470
changes the back updates whether they

157
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,500
need it or not and that's that they're

158
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,440
not only ITT but also their security

159
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,680
team so let's talk about these

160
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,260
hypotheses we wanted to go over here a

161
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:17,400
little bit so the first one is is the

162
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,570
concept of Tears

163
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:21,660
in theory operation center so we see

164
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,340
over and over again you see

165
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,979
organizations struggling with staffing

166
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:29,160
right that especially Tier one zapping

167
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,389
just seems to be this constant just

168
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:36,650
there I say hamsterviel painting just

169
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,699
organizations just constantly trying to

170
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:39,600
find good help

171
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,930
it's here one and trying to retain them

172
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,120
right for more than just a few months

173
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,590
which it seems like that's a

174
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,900
unfortunately that's us as an average

175
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,560
that we see happening a lot in that so a

176
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,450
lot of organizations that we see the

177
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,160
high-performing ones actually you're

178
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,680
moving away from that idea of Tears and

179
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,590
moving more towards other other things

180
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:03,599
I'll share with you in a few minutes

181
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,990
here but that was one of our hypotheses

182
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:08,490
there's also this this concept of

183
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,289
tearful on jobs being replaced by

184
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:12,900
automation so it's a very popular thing

185
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,860
to say

186
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,599
a lot of folks are talking about this

187
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,419
we're going to replace Tier one with

188
00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:20,190
some sort of automation right that's

189
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,410
really just a response to tier one is so

190
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,630
hard to staff or and to constantly

191
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,180
manage that there's got to be a better

192
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,120
way right so those other thing that we

193
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,270
investigated that Fox have data

194
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,039
scientists right so this is something

195
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,039
that that I think is the popular concept

196
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,979
so we kind of set out to understand if

197
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,929
that's really the case if we really are

198
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:45,720
seeing data scientists pervasively in

199
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,520
these high performing security

200
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,150
organizations

201
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,870
no one has a good incident reporting

202
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:55,610
tool bit ironic considering my employer

203
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:59,670
but this is we tend to when we talk to

204
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,860
these high-performance companies say

205
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,329
okay what do you use for your incident

206
00:09:03,329 --> 00:09:04,980
response and they'll be like oh yeah we

207
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,220
use you want them you never know right

208
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,220
here we use weird on it on a file share

209
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,829
or you know something available use a

210
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:16,410
box with something like that and that's

211
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:19,500
surprisingly right because usually these

212
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,110
organizations can buy whatever tool they

213
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:24,720
want right the kinds of budgets that

214
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,360
allow them to do that and in fact you

215
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,009
know we can tend to not see that right

216
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:31,259
so that was one of our hypotheses and

217
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:33,269
also that there is a lot of commonality

218
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:37,019
as well among among different goals and

219
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:39,420
different tool chains and things like

220
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,250
that that are in use at these

221
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,579
organizations so in order to be someone

222
00:09:44,579 --> 00:09:46,470
science that they not not terribly

223
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,060
quantitative but we kind of wrote down

224
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,610
these people policies and we lined up

225
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,560
like seven or eight people that were

226
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,750
willing to talk to us and spend some of

227
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,699
their busy time and weeks we came up

228
00:09:56,699 --> 00:09:57,990
with a bunch of questions I know you

229
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,879
can't read that but you'll be able to

230
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:02,879
see it if you download it but use the

231
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,139
questions that we asked to try to

232
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:05,750
uncover the answers to these questions

233
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:09,000
but ultimately there's plenty of my

234
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,430
humble opinion sprinkled throughout here

235
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:14,550
oh then we're here to share the best

236
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:17,899
with you Ryan makes great slide

237
00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:21,569
economist look important um and we'll

238
00:10:21,569 --> 00:10:25,790
share this with you um all right so

239
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:28,019
people are more important as well so

240
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:30,059
before I jump into kind of proving out

241
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:31,709
those hypotheses there was just a few

242
00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:33,750
things that we learned that were that

243
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,470
were pretty cool I wanted to share that

244
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,959
first one is super important because

245
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:41,699
people are more important than tools

246
00:10:41,699 --> 00:10:43,649
right and so whenever you go into an

247
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:45,740
organization this is something that that

248
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:49,199
I do a lot of my day job is we come in

249
00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:51,449
and talk to you a customer and they

250
00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:53,069
think I'm gonna start talking to them

251
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,439
about this product and I say forget

252
00:10:55,439 --> 00:10:57,120
about the product is your ever ever

253
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,980
going to be able to use that product the

254
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,569
way that you're organized right now the

255
00:11:00,569 --> 00:11:02,339
way that your security team is set up

256
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:03,900
who your management

257
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,800
it is it's ways that your management

258
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,330
ears are set out the way that your

259
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,550
security engineers and your security

260
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,520
analysts are trying to kill each other

261
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,600
all day long

262
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,910
need to fix some of those things before

263
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,860
you can actually do the tool right at

264
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,830
the start bottome and so people were

265
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:25,130
important the tool that's me and Ryan

266
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:27,240
didn't Hong Kong long time

267
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:33,270
very nice um so Trail of Tears right so

268
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:36,150
you can get the reference um for my

269
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:38,190
daughter's a specific project Trail of

270
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,470
Tears I thought that was funny I'm not

271
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:45,120
hungry honey

272
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:52,380
definitely not last time I ever but the

273
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,589
concept of rigid structure within the

274
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:57,480
security operation center of you know

275
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,400
this is Tier one and this is all that

276
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,320
they can do this is tier two this is

277
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,029
their job they only get things that are

278
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:04,890
activated to them from tier 1 and this

279
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,930
is G or 3 and they're the only ones that

280
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,880
can do hunting in your report you know

281
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,100
prescribe some some action or something

282
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,230
in the environment that's really going

283
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:16,950
away I think the one of the things that

284
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:19,200
that we found as well yeah hey what's

285
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,700
what's the perfect Security Operations

286
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,720
Center personnel look like to you and

287
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,370
these folks every one of them every

288
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,320
single one of them said the very most

289
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,810
important thing was its curiosity right

290
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,610
they wanted their security people to

291
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:35,640
have a curious mind right to be somebody

292
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,190
who's not satisfied with the surface

293
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,080
level answer the ones that dive deeper

294
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,630
right and get to the bottom of field of

295
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:45,029
the root cause of a problem and if you

296
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:46,709
can think about those types of folks

297
00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:49,580
right and creative people serious people

298
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,300
probably the worst type of

299
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,010
organizational structure that you can

300
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:55,320
possibly think of is is what we look at

301
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,089
is the traditional tiered model right

302
00:12:57,089 --> 00:12:59,130
where you have you can only do this you

303
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,959
can only do that right you're sort of

304
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,779
working against their nature by doing

305
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:08,160
that also the most valuable technical

306
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,529
skill we talk to these folks was coding

307
00:13:10,529 --> 00:13:11,760
right we said what's the most valuable

308
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,240
technical skill and they all said it

309
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,649
coding right maybe it's

310
00:13:17,649 --> 00:13:20,110
recorder powers of PowerShell or goes

311
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,029
and a little mentioned go which I was

312
00:13:22,029 --> 00:13:26,709
impressed with it I don't know go myself

313
00:13:26,709 --> 00:13:30,009
but um you know playing on certainly so

314
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:33,269
you get the ability right to tie

315
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:35,980
different products together different

316
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,290
processes together into some kind of

317
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:40,689
scripting or coding if you don't have to

318
00:13:40,689 --> 00:13:42,730
be an application architect right you

319
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:45,939
will need to be a software developer

320
00:13:45,939 --> 00:13:47,800
right professional for say it you need

321
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,290
to be able to pull things together need

322
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:52,149
to be able to write code very

323
00:13:52,149 --> 00:13:56,529
practically so very very important a lot

324
00:13:56,529 --> 00:13:57,819
of the boats when we talk to you said

325
00:13:57,819 --> 00:13:59,860
hey do the folks in your sock have

326
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,749
degrees and a lot of people don't and

327
00:14:01,749 --> 00:14:04,600
that's a great note no worries but of

328
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,850
the people that do that a what kind of

329
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:09,730
degrees um do people have right in

330
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:11,889
desert mr. manager of giant high

331
00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:15,059
performing sauce or just miss manager

332
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:16,720
will pun intended

333
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,139
um what you know what types of degrees

334
00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:22,300
to your people have right and there's

335
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,519
you know normal stuff computer science

336
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:26,499
and certain types of engineering and

337
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:28,749
that sort of thing but also we're really

338
00:14:28,749 --> 00:14:31,329
surprised to find there's tons of folks

339
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:36,759
with with psychology degrees philosophy

340
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:37,300
degrees

341
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,029
use it right other other types of

342
00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:42,069
degrees where we're critical thinking or

343
00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:44,679
report on sort of organized patterns of

344
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:46,779
thought were useful right but not

345
00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:51,819
necessarily technically oriented oh yeah

346
00:14:51,819 --> 00:14:57,040
this is the best so learn to communicate

347
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,529
clearly overwritten and gooder speaking

348
00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:04,839
um so hope this is super important right

349
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:07,120
like even is technical right the most

350
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,549
technical person in the room you still

351
00:15:09,549 --> 00:15:11,319
need to be able to sell your ideas and

352
00:15:11,319 --> 00:15:13,929
communicate them right everybody in some

353
00:15:13,929 --> 00:15:15,749
ways has to sell something to somebody

354
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:18,790
whether it be your technical approach to

355
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:21,040
a problem or you're getting buy-in right

356
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,619
it's your analysis of a breach or

357
00:15:23,619 --> 00:15:26,769
something like that is correct very very

358
00:15:26,769 --> 00:15:29,649
important to have those communication

359
00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:30,300
skills

360
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:37,050
oh yeah so the sort of emergence of data

361
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:39,510
signs in security operations is an

362
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:43,710
interesting one one of the one of the

363
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,150
guys who talked to you guy in Denver

364
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,280
runs the security operation center for

365
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,110
one of the biggest healthcare companies

366
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:51,990
in the world gichan said you know we're

367
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:54,000
actually not trying to automate to your

368
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,400
one right I mention that earlier he's

369
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,080
like we're just trying to build such

370
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,120
better detection mechanisms user data

371
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,000
science that the vast majority of the

372
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,790
things that your one traditionally has

373
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:09,420
done they they just do this aren't there

374
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,070
we've eliminated those things right

375
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,050
they're not there because the detection

376
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:15,300
mechanisms are more solid because

377
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,330
they're based on some of the premises in

378
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:22,140
data science very much a buzzword of

379
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,090
course there aren't that many true

380
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:26,970
security data scientists around the

381
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:29,100
organization we thought to add them as

382
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,720
their the big ones it's important that

383
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,670
type of thing

384
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:37,290
however the I think the premise right

385
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:39,630
that the pieces and parts that go into a

386
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,700
data Sciences those those things are

387
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,050
becoming more and more important

388
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:45,120
definitely something to take away right

389
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,890
you don't need to necessarily be a

390
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:52,620
master of machine learning right but you

391
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,720
should be able to understand what's the

392
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,000
distribution of my data right because it

393
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,430
makes sense for me to do a standard

394
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:01,650
deviation analysis or the interquartile

395
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:03,660
range or something like that it's just

396
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,780
very quickly packing to do a analysis is

397
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,700
the spike in activity right into some

398
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:12,089
anomaly those types of skills like

399
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:15,329
practical skills that our data scientist

400
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:17,270
will be a master of those things but

401
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,800
security ops people need to have those

402
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,280
skills in general right those teachers

403
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,680
who borrow from the tactical the

404
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:31,230
tactical parts of that versus on-prem so

405
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,210
this is something that is fascinating to

406
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:35,610
me this is mostly happened since I've

407
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:37,890
been not so operational from the

408
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:38,559
security

409
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,529
effective but that's the fact that many

410
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:43,659
companies right actually has less and

411
00:17:43,659 --> 00:17:46,210
less infrastructure that's traditionally

412
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,879
on from right in their four walls like

413
00:17:48,879 --> 00:17:51,610
the company I work for you know we

414
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,889
actually have almost no no

415
00:17:53,889 --> 00:17:55,960
infrastructure inside our four walls

416
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,210
right all of our you know files are

417
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:04,029
stored in a box you know our customer

418
00:18:04,029 --> 00:18:06,610
data is stored with a operating service

419
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:09,759
company our you know most of our

420
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:11,529
infrastructure is provided by cloud

421
00:18:11,529 --> 00:18:14,049
service providers etc so you start

422
00:18:14,049 --> 00:18:16,269
thinking about the things that security

423
00:18:16,269 --> 00:18:18,399
operations center needs to do like an

424
00:18:18,399 --> 00:18:21,009
imperative perimeter maybe look at some

425
00:18:21,009 --> 00:18:24,549
some post bases post based data that

426
00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:26,889
sort of thing that's all kind of flipped

427
00:18:26,889 --> 00:18:29,740
around right and collecting the right

428
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,480
data through security operations center

429
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,360
is also become quite a different quite a

430
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,740
different endeavor than it used to be

431
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,929
not just for forwarding a lot from

432
00:18:37,929 --> 00:18:39,789
servers just logging company from a

433
00:18:39,789 --> 00:18:42,369
network device but pulling data maybe

434
00:18:42,369 --> 00:18:46,659
from an API or maybe if you had a

435
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:48,700
service that posts data back to you

436
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,159
right look at platform as a service it

437
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:52,509
will say you know we're going to

438
00:18:52,509 --> 00:18:54,669
actually going to just give us a RL

439
00:18:54,669 --> 00:18:56,470
listener we're going to post all that

440
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,149
data back to you that's your mob data

441
00:18:58,149 --> 00:19:01,269
right I'm so lots of different them lots

442
00:19:01,269 --> 00:19:02,860
of different paradigms going on there

443
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:07,749
for certain yeah I mentioned just

444
00:19:07,749 --> 00:19:10,269
earlier the most important analyst

445
00:19:10,269 --> 00:19:12,759
trades right and talk to these folks was

446
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:16,299
curiosity and and I think this probably

447
00:19:16,299 --> 00:19:18,999
surprised anybody but you know I think

448
00:19:18,999 --> 00:19:23,289
that's you know that that means is to

449
00:19:23,289 --> 00:19:25,659
hire people right that aren't satisfied

450
00:19:25,659 --> 00:19:28,899
with simple answers we're willing that

451
00:19:28,899 --> 00:19:31,119
something's just bothering them so badly

452
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:33,009
after they get home from work right that

453
00:19:33,009 --> 00:19:34,840
they're like oh I got it I got to dive

454
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,240
in right I got to find out why you know

455
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,700
that packet looked like it

456
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,210
that that log error message said what it

457
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:45,240
is writing and diving diving down deeper

458
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:58,290
so so I do these little hypotheses of

459
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:59,880
you pop it on earlier so the

460
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,310
organization couldn't ask tears and that

461
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:04,140
tear when jobs are being replaced by

462
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,300
automation

463
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,940
the best Doc's have data scientist no

464
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,240
one has a good reporting tool and socks

465
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,400
have similar people and toolset so and

466
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,290
we're doing this mythbuster style even

467
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:22,740
though they went off the air sadly a new

468
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:26,700
one doesn't count so organizations have

469
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,350
new packs here so I think this is

470
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:31,110
something we have a lot of these

471
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,790
organizations I mean how do you actually

472
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:35,700
organize your security operations team

473
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,010
and many of them told us you look at it

474
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:40,920
as a one of them actually use these

475
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,840
exact words and we look at it like a

476
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,270
draft right when we go out to hire we

477
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:47,640
find sort of the best person available

478
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,660
right and we don't know necessarily

479
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,980
we're not that necessarily is worried

480
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:56,400
about exactly what what their precise

481
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,220
skills are we have sort of a team of

482
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:02,010
generalists right they can code the has

483
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,720
a curious mind right if they're good

484
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,330
communicator and they work well they

485
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:08,910
work well in a team one point gentleman

486
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:11,780
mentioned that that who looks at it is

487
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:14,550
folks on his operations team and it's

488
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:17,610
like a almost like a mission team right

489
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,100
where you have this you have a somebody

490
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,840
who's just as comfortable working an

491
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,670
incident right and responding to an

492
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:26,610
incident on one day as they are the next

493
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,530
day like going to the security

494
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:31,830
engineering team right and say oh let's

495
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,630
let's pull something off you that needs

496
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:35,400
to be done right these two systems need

497
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,110
to talk to each other you know this

498
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,550
thread is healthy needs to be

499
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,560
automatically downloaded and ingested

500
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,170
into our indoor stand or something like

501
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:43,620
that

502
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,350
taking projects like that and running

503
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,970
with those and implementing those and

504
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:50,280
then the next day maybe you know working

505
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,110
in incident again invaded a next day

506
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,600
like doing some threat hunting something

507
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,450
like that right so I'm trying to play

508
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:00,180
this you know sort of structure the job

509
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,220
and the requirement of the job or to

510
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,920
satisfy the types of people that he's

511
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,900
trying to attract right trying to

512
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,550
attract people that like to do different

513
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,500
things that have a broad skill set that

514
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,300
are generalists and communicate on that

515
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:16,680
so make a job being more aligned to that

516
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:21,420
and was pretty cool from the times when

517
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,890
we asked a couple of these folks

518
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:25,740
mentioned that tears are actually still

519
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:28,380
a lot of the reason why period exists in

520
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,790
the first place is because they might

521
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:32,700
give an NSF fee so they might say our

522
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,430
Tier one environment SP so which is make

523
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,840
sense that there's these kind of

524
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:40,380
boundaries around them but for a lot of

525
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,480
these other organizations I was pretty

526
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,540
cool this is the generalist idea because

527
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,040
that's a job on a blog right that would

528
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:51,690
be super fun super fun sort of rule to

529
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:59,450
find yourself in all right automation

530
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,110
so everybody said they want to replace

531
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:09,320
the tier one analyst with automation

532
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,840
anything to say eating things is for a

533
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,260
vendor to say just very very hard to

534
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:20,610
write hard to realize that I don't think

535
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:24,750
that we see we don't we don't see you I

536
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,760
first started thinking about automation

537
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,670
for security a few years ago or

538
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:31,140
automated response that sort of thing I

539
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,790
kind of I kind of wrote it off and said

540
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,890
it will never never work because I had a

541
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:37,070
kind of a narrow view in my own head

542
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,600
okay there's alert Flyers then we're

543
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,980
going to go and do something

544
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,710
automatically right and it's not there's

545
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,660
too many things that are scary about

546
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:48,090
that I would you know be suing things

547
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:49,980
that you wanted human being to look at

548
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:53,030
and confirm and you know make sure that

549
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:56,720
that's the right thing right but and

550
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,710
then that's true I think that's still

551
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:01,110
true winning most of us who run security

552
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:03,630
programs we don't want to say turn off

553
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:06,150
our production website right in response

554
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:08,130
to some alert that we got from a certain

555
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:10,410
system in our network we want to keep it

556
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:12,570
being to see that alert and make that

557
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:15,870
halt however that that a narrow human

558
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:17,910
right of automation was wrong on my part

559
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:19,680
right because there's so much more that

560
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,590
you can do with automation the big thing

561
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:25,680
I think that we see is is sort of the

562
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:29,550
automated triage and automated context

563
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:32,430
gathering so we see an alert right and

564
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,320
I'm going to go take some crazy action

565
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,580
based on that that you're going to go

566
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,680
pull a whole bunch more data from your

567
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,650
environment right hold the list of

568
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:42,600
running processes from a machine or

569
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,540
below maybe even a memory down

570
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:48,060
forensic disk image or just you know say

571
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:50,070
okay we got this alert for this user

572
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:52,170
let's find out the last ten systems of

573
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:54,510
my user logged into or let's find out

574
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:57,360
the last ten email domain they received

575
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,100
an email from with a name of the last

576
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,410
zero 50 attachments and they received or

577
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:02,970
whatever these are things that are

578
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,980
pretty easy to automate in a lot of

579
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:09,270
systems if someone you do a job pretty

580
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:11,190
well as you can pull these things

581
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:14,250
together right into what I've heard

582
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,620
described as a triage package which I

583
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:19,350
like that a lot at that term so that the

584
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:21,150
first time if your analyst rank is

585
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:23,280
really expensive people is really

586
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,930
valuable people that we've been talking

587
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:26,700
about the first time they laid eyes on

588
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,880
it there's a whole bunch more context

589
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,950
rather they have available to them but

590
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:34,260
the first 15 minutes of activity that

591
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,810
they might they might normally do to go

592
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:39,180
you know I see this alert you know my

593
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,280
normal response is to go look that up in

594
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,800
my inventory system and see drones and I

595
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,350
maybe search for logs or whatever is all

596
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,810
these manually steps right these are

597
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:50,280
things that could be automated and

598
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,830
that's where I think the biggest benefit

599
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:56,360
of automation is coming is coming in

600
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,710
every once in a while I can residue

601
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:01,020
somebody says yeah we actually making

602
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,960
the actual block something will block an

603
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,790
IP address or something into surgery we

604
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:08,310
see a certain moment that is generally

605
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:11,280
the attraction and definitely not the

606
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:16,500
norm so the best Doc's have a design so

607
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,730
I kind of dwell on this a little bit

608
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:20,430
earlier jump go ahead but we are

609
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:23,400
speaking this we are seeing the most

610
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,810
advanced stop going in this direction I

611
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:31,020
think that there's it's hard to find in

612
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,240
security data scientists right there was

613
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,370
some great training after data rooms at

614
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:37,710
the training that's besides yeah

615
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:39,870
so you guys got in the morning from John

616
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:41,670
you got a whole bunch of great

617
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:43,590
information about machine learning

618
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:46,289
in science and so that information

619
00:26:46,289 --> 00:26:48,659
starting to get out there and perform

620
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:50,520
with local training sessions and things

621
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,900
like that I think the in my opinion

622
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,400
racist unless you're going to devote

623
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,789
your career kind of to that you might

624
00:26:59,789 --> 00:27:01,140
want to do more like what I described

625
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,779
earlier right which is to say you know I

626
00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:06,210
should know the basics of I should know

627
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:08,100
the basics of how to how to select a

628
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,470
machine learning model or like what are

629
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:12,000
the categories of different types of

630
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,100
machine learning or just basic

631
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,169
statistics right how do i how do i

632
00:27:16,169 --> 00:27:18,270
calculate an average in a meaning and a

633
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:21,480
enter deviation and therefore power

634
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,860
range these things are pretty simple

635
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:25,110
like you can do minutes Allen and other

636
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:28,350
tools on those kinds of things right

637
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:30,779
that I think are achievable for most

638
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:33,539
organizations professional and a

639
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:35,820
security data scientist although you do

640
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,309
see in more little more frequently than

641
00:27:38,309 --> 00:27:42,899
some YouTube no one ever goes into their

642
00:27:42,899 --> 00:27:45,299
reporting tool so this one is funny

643
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:47,789
because we I haven't worked for a

644
00:27:47,789 --> 00:27:50,309
company that sells such a thing often

645
00:27:50,309 --> 00:27:53,070
but we're not seeing anybody out there

646
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:55,049
saying and this is the best way to

647
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:58,230
record all the aspects of an incident or

648
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:01,350
record all the aspects of a threat actor

649
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,909
right there's tools out there

650
00:28:02,909 --> 00:28:05,610
I know those vendors out there Drakken

651
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:08,429
act good root man and others they're

652
00:28:08,429 --> 00:28:10,649
diving model approach to collecting

653
00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:13,049
indicators and information about

654
00:28:13,049 --> 00:28:14,700
adversaries and then those kind of

655
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:18,600
things good solution but consistently

656
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,429
blown away by everybody's like oh we

657
00:28:20,429 --> 00:28:22,649
definitely use this tool or that tool or

658
00:28:22,649 --> 00:28:24,779
yet sometimes we've seen both with Chris

659
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:26,460
or something like that

660
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:30,049
for indicator posit or II but definitely

661
00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:34,350
definitely not not even a classic tool

662
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:37,350
really that that are that we see

663
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:40,500
consistently out there so anybody wants

664
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:44,700
to want to start good start up ideas you

665
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,029
down

666
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:53,190
so this one security operation centers

667
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:58,020
has similar people and cools us so the

668
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:01,080
idea here that high-performing

669
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,900
organizations are trending in the same

670
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,920
same direction right moving towards

671
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,960
moving towards folks with similar skill

672
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,559
sets and you're definitely seeing this

673
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,660
you know this this concept of the

674
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,040
generalist and the security operation

675
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,679
center that can do internet response it

676
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,600
can do a little bit of coding and do a

677
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,090
little bit of fret hunting and then

678
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:25,799
there's still you know a lot of

679
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:27,900
specialist right product but I call them

680
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,240
gilts sometimes registers groups like

681
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,690
reverse engineers or really deep threat

682
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:35,100
hunters for her divorce evening

683
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,530
operators that really beat cyber threat

684
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:41,070
the threat intelligence analyst writing

685
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,260
track adversaries over long periods of

686
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:43,500
time

687
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,780
maybe has language skills and you know

688
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:48,150
that support you know the type of

689
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:50,429
adversary they're going after those

690
00:29:50,429 --> 00:29:52,950
gilts still exist those specialty still

691
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:56,280
exist but it's often that we talk to

692
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,770
they're looking for ahead folks you can

693
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:03,510
do boxes a nice flow alright so

694
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:08,370
takeaways um we're gonna actually going

695
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:10,820
to write all this up into a white paper

696
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:14,940
full of blog posts probably coming out

697
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,860
soon and so and without all the

698
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,350
typography these questions attention not

699
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,760
