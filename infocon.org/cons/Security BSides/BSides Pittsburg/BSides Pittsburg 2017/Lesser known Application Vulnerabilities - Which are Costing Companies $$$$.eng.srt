to talk about apps Tech in 2017 looks a

52
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,690
lot like this

53
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,319
[Laughter]

54
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:37,650
so when we thought about in 2017 we're

55
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,510
making the headlines and what's keeping

56
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,579
us busy darlings

57
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:43,920
so for the three people here doing bug

58
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,299
bounties we see wanted to raise their

59
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:48,420
hand but those are cube right now we'll

60
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,430
get more of that here involvement we're

61
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,340
now up to seven digits on DVD because we

62
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,739
get Aundre orderlies

63
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:58,470
we needed to make that longer we're

64
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,959
experiencing naive in 2009 Soulja

65
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,819
everyday we're finding these angles

66
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:05,280
rated reinvented the difference in the

67
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,069
curated circumstances everything's

68
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:10,290
connected this is a surprise anyone I'm

69
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,000
afraid to talk into my nest cam and

70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,250
that's me in the car like at all

71
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,250
in regards of my card drawn like all

72
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,060
that the stuff and whatever the crypto

73
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,769
ransoms paid a lot change currency today

74
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:27,049
so what does that really mean for us

75
00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:30,419
that means a lot of work anyone out

76
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,160

check for that ex accept it because that

92
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,180
was unbelievable

93
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,510
code per day if you happen to be in

94
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,728
security and you care about ethics

95
00:04:16,728 --> 00:04:19,519
there is never-ending get hungry codes

96
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,160
out there if you could stage in D for

97
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,419
rest of your life there's some drama out

98
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:28,790
there and you learn the out security

99
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,949
world I will point fingers or name games

100
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:36,830
but the codec drama yeah and I didn't

101
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:39,110
say there's a requirement to stay up to

102
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,720
date things are involving a lot of our

103
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,810
platforms are kind of rehab and things

104
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:47,050
just rehab in a different way however

105
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,639
the bond abilities are new intriguing

106
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:51,800
interesting and staying up to date on

107
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,320
this all is again itself will not God so

108
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,120
without further ado I'm going to improve

109
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,160
some does this is we should be looking

110
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,860
at in our day-to-day lot if you are

111
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,750
familiar are not familiar with something

112
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,789
if you have questions I want this to be

113
00:05:07,789 --> 00:05:09,199
interactive raise your hand

114
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,180
happy to get some questions answered

115
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:14,979
upfront you don't have to include in it

116
00:05:14,979 --> 00:05:17,539
okay this is Liam here is familiar with

117
00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:22,130
a lot top ten that's over half fantastic

118
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,500
I like to talk about the drama three

119
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,919
2013 version but that's me

120
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,630
so this is a lot that you're not

121
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,090
familiar with it is the top 10 web

122
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,919
application security vulnerabilities

123
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,669
there in some Ouija boards that way

124
00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:40,820
we're creating in this top 10 list but

125
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,169
there's no business up right yet

126
00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:48,320
injection covers a huge majority of

127
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,430
different type of injection

128
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,710
vulnerabilities for broken into

129
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:54,560
categories we have broken off medication

130
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,800

132
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,550
reference any one of those those are my

133
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:04,010
favorite you feed into dirt again or

134
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:05,960
what happened fine thermostat by one

135
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,789
okay there's no one else's bank account

136
00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:11,690
um hearing misusing is huge

137
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:15,139
I read a study a few weeks ago and I'm

138
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:17,300
already water could come on the spot but

139
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,129
what it does it's

140
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:22,470
facility wasn't this together actually

141
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:25,710
cook in that the the Verizon DVR

142
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,050
breaches basket lock top 10 freshly

143
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,150
ground look was the most prevalent thing

144
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,860
because I'm saying you're telling you

145
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,900
usually wears out objections I'm putting

146
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,060
it on TV we're not dropping stripping a

147
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,400
little drop a turkey legs to a big

148
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,069
breach and any major way where we know

149
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:42,599
there'd be folks out there we know

150
00:06:42,599 --> 00:06:44,699
there's anything you can do you're

151
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:46,680
running arbitrary code your router on

152
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,719
someone's machine but the end today

153
00:06:48,719 --> 00:06:50,580
where's the breach what is that map out

154
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,039
it and whatever event formula this

155
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,440
person used and again not trying to to

156
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,240
the great event but they said that

157
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,949
security misconfigurations was the

158
00:06:58,949 --> 00:07:02,610
number one alleged in those breaches you

159
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:05,129
know what Andrew a with that we're done

160
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:07,099
covering but about here today

161
00:07:07,099 --> 00:07:11,279
you can look at the rest of the stuff

162
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:14,490
alright so jump right in here anyone

163
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:17,599
here a server-side the quest for dreams

164
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,610
one two and greatly we're going to talk

165
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,830
on so server-side requests ordinary this

166
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,690
is business katakana cheat not good

167
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:27,389
electronic record race but you're kind

168
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:29,550
of making someone do something that they

169
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:32,099
didn't really want to do so we can call

170
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:35,490
it uh similar to products forgery but

171
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:38,159
basically attackers use certified

172
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:40,469
request forgeries to probe internal port

173
00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:42,690
and then consuls get around

174
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:45,080
I can whitelist peek at this control it

175
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,400
yeah sounds fun

176
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,460
I was fine after that right so uh we're

177
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,060
talking about it

178
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,620
full disclosure I took this image from

179
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,750
that Parker I did not create this they

180
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:01,409
had not finished and using it so if I am

181
00:08:01,409 --> 00:08:04,770
mr. Thackeray user and interacting with

182
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,279
your web server up here there are

183
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,129
already lots of all or delete English

184
00:08:11,129 --> 00:08:15,629
audience utilize your server to do my

185
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:20,159
pain and bypass me altogether next all

186
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:23,819
of server side request ordering for them

187
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:26,539
or what that looked like and

188
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:30,030
this is what it look like imagine this

189
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:33,899
is an HTTP request get a fee thought

190
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:36,269
Pittsburghers domain and you're talking

191
00:08:36,269 --> 00:08:39,990
there's good and because they did more

192
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,990
cache it or the one that gets muscle

193
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,850
today or they want to increase their a

194
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:48,060
three bills because pin for both their

195
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,570
s-300 or a good bottle and three and

196
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:54,420
it's punku buttons URL bring alright but

197
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,220
instead of making you go out and fetch

198
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,550
that a lot of quasi stuff they decide

199
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,839
they're going to pull that back for

200
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:03,660
whatever you have ACI easier way they

201
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:07,380
see them what happened but this is user

202
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,470
controllable dead right so what if I

203
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:14,600
change from because Pittsburgh 2015 -

204
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,089
although s3 super secret password

205
00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:19,740
manager all right

206
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,350
and now what if you as an organization I

207
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,269
see whitelisted ETSU proceed to that

208
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:26,880
ministry or function but only come from

209
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,250
your internal server but now I'm

210
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,649
controlling requests that are actually

211
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:34,440
originating from your server out at

212
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,949
three not just bypass Euler - like now

213
00:09:37,949 --> 00:09:39,779
you might be thinking your self okay the

214
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,130
house you can manage at the self

215
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:43,199
bathroom users that's where some little

216
00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:45,329
tricky some of it may be blind you might

217
00:09:45,329 --> 00:09:47,910
have to rely on say how long the request

218
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:51,510
hook answer using boolean logic or what

219
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:54,120
happened but the end of the day you are

220
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,089
supplying an end user the ability to

221
00:09:57,089 --> 00:10:00,360
make requests to arbitrary resources

222
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,920
that is fully controllable from the user

223
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,519
side but the originating from your third

224
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,890
there's a different version of it which

225
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:14,010
of you may be more familiar with it's a

226
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:19,140
health external entity injection so sspe

227
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,209
is pretty simple basically you have

228
00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:24,959
these BCD declarations at the top of

229
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,899
your XML and basically what you could do

230
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:30,570
if it's it direct smell a lot of parser

231
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:31,110
rose

232
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:33,510
or vision and all of that good stuff you

233
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:37,380
can actually declare external entities

234
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,990
irregular using HTTPS because Pittsburg

235
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:42,630
calm and what have you and amazingly

236
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:45,959
this halo here simcha see it interviews

237
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:48,120
with audio yes enough when that's red

238
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,050
this is declared up here and compared in

239
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,519
brief some system and adult

240
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,800
I'm just looking pool this died in at

241
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,649
least from this this external site so it

242
00:10:58,649 --> 00:11:01,140
reaches out right so this is very very

243
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,390
similar to the previous example except

244
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,950
for we've known about this for a while

245
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:08,640
as XML I can see a lot of the parsers

246
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,470
and the server bust up is a type of box

247
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,410
to protect against it but at the end of

248
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,970
the day it's the same vulnerability

249
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:20,550
basically you are utilizing the internal

250
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:25,980
system or the idea of dynamic and

251
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,800
pulling down content on bananas it's

252
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,810
rotating from the server side and easy

253
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:35,250
to work damage so we talked about a

254
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:38,190
server side request forgeries the first

255
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,899
thing we want to look at the cobweb how

256
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,640
do you identify what just look like how

257
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,040
can we protect ourselves so the easiest

258
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,899
and most thorough way through this is

259
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:48,449
the source analysis because all of our

260
00:11:48,449 --> 00:11:51,209
source is repose our life easy to review

261
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:53,250
and don't have any alarms koves

262
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,110
so we get to be bleep point that say

263
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,120
without ganna people in that age just

264
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,560
coming from these are controllable data

265
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:04,470
right right okay ah yeah so this goes

266
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:07,110
out to pan - I don't know anything out

267
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:10,130
locks and or checkmark the web inspector

268
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,690
fortify whatever it is it does it's out

269
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,430
of the box of watching poisonous and say

270
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:16,680
hey other bands there's some type of

271
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,040
change source this is user controllable

272
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,660
data I don't know anyone that watches

273
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:25,079
hwagok as SSRS but I'm sure speedy

274
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:28,199
training center to do it but most likely

275
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:30,300
you're going to be seeing this owner

276
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,000
ability show up at run convey a human

277
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,949
interaction right ten pet serves on

278
00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:36,420
analyst or actually can see that

279
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,270
parameter put that into contact try out

280
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:42,120
for a lot of a or ellen see if you can

281
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:42,780
resolve

282
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:46,470
from an extra Monty sorry

283
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,900
if it results from the server's IP or an

284
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,710
I found agent so England here use our

285
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:56,220
flat collaborator couple people so Burke

286
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:56,880
library

287
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,950
it basically is instant the first week

288
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:01,530
web application proxy that can solve on

289
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,630
a server somewhere just exposed to the

290
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,670
Internet and what happens is and you are

291
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:08,520
utilizing work to do your skin extracted

292
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,550
inning it will actually generate a DNS

293
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,980
request and team behind the Sun tables

294
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,170
that are looking to reach that out to

295
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,390
this collaborator server so this these

296
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:22,350
calls that are coming from URL that was

297
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:25,140
the creatives which have a crazy do it

298
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:28,200
it can then that goes back to the tables

299
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,990
which it originated from be affirmed but

300
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,880
again you have to have a set up

301
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,090
something that's out of boss and it

302
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:39,000
requires a little bit of work at the

303
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,070
other days to remediate it is pretty

304
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,900
straightforward we talked about this in

305
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,140
context of other co-op and zone you

306
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:49,200
never trust user inputs we always say

307
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,170
that man's eyes don't allow either

308
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:55,740
insolence don't expose server side pause

309
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,600
so at the end of days you want to reach

310
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,740
out to pull down dynamic content don't

311
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,380
put it as a printer in a poster or

312
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,360
Easter egg or whatever I just do that

313
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,490
also kind of met back in that function

314
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:11,370
right do the query you don't allow that

315
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:14,180
to be exposed from from from the outside

316
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:17,790
and as I happen to mention it xml card

317
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,790
for doubly disable DTD represent

318
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,650
declaration to this effect yourself

319
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:28,730
again XML EES SP all right from Sophie

320
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,110
okay

321
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,910
the dips one anti automation this one

322
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,130
down pretty straightforward simple verb

323
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:38,280
another time it's very rare that I've

324
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,920
done with an assessment where I work and

325
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,870
don't like bar comes out of anti

326
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,790
automation when we're putting some

327
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,530
different objects today I'll talk about

328
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:49,350
three very specific things SMS

329
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:55,280
use out of a lot medicator at bat in dpi

330
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,990
okay I know it's probably a little

331
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,460
grainy little Hardesty does anyone know

332
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,980
what this is little little bit circle

333
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,160
for dots in it training for external

334
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:09,630
service the number one SMS service out

335
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:13,920
there you've all heard of it

336
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,060
willow Lily over 100k okay one for good

337
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,820
so this is a framework to basically

338
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,250
utilize Herschel framework they will

339
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:27,900
send SMS messages on under services

340
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,910
behalf right so this is almost as big

341
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,010
players ever to spend on that that's the

342
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,500
Jews eater I found authentication short

343
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:39,450
codes or hey your balance is low on your

344
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,250
account or whatnot a lot of these are

345
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,640
using Scalia's API use this you can see

346
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,510
here that for example short code best

347
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:51,990
messages for high-volume clients are

348
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:56,340
pack a penny pervenche right so not a

349
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:59,280
whole lot of money but what happens if

350
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:03,990
we don't forget the corn that utilize

351
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:08,330
this forced a password reset or say

352
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:11,760
Nocenti your latest info on that's why

353
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,490
we products via text message in any one

354
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:16,070
magical book happens you're not

355
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:20,870
protecting innovation on the API calls

356
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:23,700
this bill is going to go through the

357
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:27,060
route I seen this I I'm doing today

358
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:30,480
holy we were just leading lead um

359
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,400
with a huge service charge because

360
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,010
someone ran a fighter for

361
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:37,530
purposely ran or bill on this as a net

362
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:40,830
service just to stand users or predicts

363
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:44,820
and whatnot ah and well because this SMS

364
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,700
I used to work in silence on my network

365
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:50,610
they go and why are so many many years

366
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,640
this is our consensus the infrastructure

367
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:57,420
is old is a fallback to not even like 20

368
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,579
or one Jeter Network before all of that

369
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:01,019
involved bathroom

370
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:02,790
that's why unless you can detect message

371
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:05,429
is an area the Union have service others

372
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:07,920
gone through because it's an old service

373
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,170
and because it's cold cost a lot of

374
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:12,720
money to transmit though so when you add

375
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,349
the carrier charges on top of a provider

376
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:19,770
to Tullio you get really costly bills so

377
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,439
if I were to run up 300,000 best

378
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:25,049
messages in a matter of seconds against

379
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:26,939
your API is charging you half a penny

380
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:29,370
per message that's a significant

381
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:31,410
difference your start up with using

382
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:34,830
cannot mount functionality either the

383
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:37,740
one it would want to pay that bill for

384
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,710
simple inside automation miss in my fat

385
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:45,679
metrics or AP icon into another

386
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,720
unprotected resource today I remember a

387
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,059
rainbow here about this guy

388
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:55,410
Facebook last year he found that you

389
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:58,380
reset your password Facebook send you it

390
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,840
out about out of day in deck connectors

391
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,380
okay

392
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,110
enter this code in and when you enter

393
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:08,790
that code we will validate that

394
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:11,280
server-side and then note you are either

395
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,590
user who sent has a reason it it's

396
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,720
Miller with this pretty you know

397
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,780
well done concept so this guy tested

398
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,150
this on Facebook okay I'm forced to

399
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:23,460
think I just run rural millions or

400
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,860
whatever that odel number of blank

401
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:30,840
carriers are to think yeah and this

402
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,429
reports the thing is see if I can get in

403
00:18:32,429 --> 00:18:33,870
someone's account you try that on

404
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:38,340
production can avail like on our network

405
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,530
but then you try to not data because for

406
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,419
whatever reason everything that work in

407
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:44,580
production is in beta you can just log

408
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,650
into beta is up facebook.com/

409
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,750
with your production cred and then to in

410
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,700
and you can try out a new feature or as

411
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,010
an auditor them now basically allows you

412
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:56,970
to do ah but he drop same thing and

413
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,919
brute force on beta here sure enough

414
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:00,870
they were missing their API

415
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:06,779
anteye automation controls in beta so

416
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:08,909
what he did is he just forced through

417
00:19:08,909 --> 00:19:13,409
the pin code you know 1 5 4 0 1 0 0 & 1

418
00:19:13,409 --> 00:19:16,470
0 to better Sarah was actually able to

419
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:20,039
basically force reset someone password

420
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:23,190
reset with complete loop course right so

421
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:25,049
they were doing the repeater production

422
00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:26,700
environment but unfortunately they

423
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,669
failed at data and that led to that

424
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:33,330
automation last which caused real world

425
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:36,330
path and he was a copy 10 or 15 grand

426
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:39,629
for figure it out so who was going to do

427
00:19:39,629 --> 00:19:41,340
bug bounty from you leave your accrual

428
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:44,159
is right there some silly but that is a

429
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:49,559
big big big money so there's what the

430
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:52,200
general API is used so other work with

431
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,269
some the financials out there and there

432
00:19:54,269 --> 00:19:57,919
things like you know stop services or

433
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,509
Bloomberg alerts or whatever that

434
00:20:00,509 --> 00:20:04,110
someone once little Bob charging for and

435
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:06,720
those services actually caught certain

436
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,249
providing money even though you may see

437
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:10,409
it in your user interface on the website

438
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:13,230
they all look there's a newsfeed coming

439
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:15,860
from XYZ source it says that the

440
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,690
analytics are showing the XYZ stock is

441
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:20,730
going to go up tomorrow there's a good

442
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:23,070
chance to the provider with any of that

443
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,509
information is actually paying for those

444
00:20:24,509 --> 00:20:26,490
calls from some servers on the backend

445
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:31,590
what's that exposed to be a female X or

446
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:34,679
or what have you and user is able to

447
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:37,049
invoke those queries directly or you'll

448
00:20:37,049 --> 00:20:38,759
have a throttle property words reaching

449
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:40,350
out every time because you're against

450
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:43,529
cash and they ring up in a 10,000

451
00:20:43,529 --> 00:20:45,419
queries against a denied and now again

452
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:47,519
you're putting two bills for someone

453
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:50,340
else being silly and trying to secure

454
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:53,940
you a non-public API bunch of times your

455
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:56,789
key is being used right so um

456
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:58,830
something to be cognizant up I didn't

457
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,119
have a really good example to show

458
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:02,190
something that's Ben's allowed most

459
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:04,320
likely because this wouldn't be really

460
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,289
seen by end-user this is something that

461
00:21:07,289 --> 00:21:07,900
we serve

462
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,690
providing speeds our bill goes low or

463
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:12,750
has come from why we all sudden seeing

464
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:19,780
$10,000 from bloomberg xyb API and the

465
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,520
end-user had no idea they even caused

466
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,370
that or they did they were pretty

467
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:25,830
knowledgeable

468
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:29,820
so if foundation in general again

469
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,200
identification you're really look this

470
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,059
through source code analysis

471
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:37,090
I don't know again of a scanner out

472
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:39,179
there looking for in that automation

473
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:42,540
fallacy to your post so if you do

474
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,920
 after this and I can add my

475
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:49,120
little list of not try them but that can

476
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,830
be your airplane to look for is when

477
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:51,940
you're looking for your code if you're

478
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:55,179
having third-party reviews definitely

479
00:21:55,179 --> 00:21:57,400
look for areas that may be prone to

480
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,650
abuse services a you pay money for

481
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:02,080
services that you're relying on security

482
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,580
out of and communication or services

483
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:09,190
Vista rely on their parties you make

484
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:10,750
sure that your perception is again in

485
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,220
the automation if they're triggered by a

486
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:15,520
user generated event and of course

487
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,110
menial hesitation sentences again

488
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,610
something you're going to find traffic

489
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:20,620
offender solve mouse is something with

490
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,250
that sort

491
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,650
humans are considerate finding me sort

492
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,570
of thing if they can see clearly from

493
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:32,110
a-z remediation rates on it right so it

494
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:35,050
is if you have all of a sudden surge

495
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:37,150
from certain quantities your cookie or

496
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:40,510
whatever in a server-side session that

497
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:43,809
is query from that server to cost you

498
00:22:43,809 --> 00:22:47,050
money and it seems out of normal

499
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:49,090
behavior or it's above a certain

500
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:52,750
threshold limit back gray less then one

501
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,540
every five seconds or 10 seconds the

502
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,820
user model doesn't say hey things are a

503
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:00,400
little bit slow but from recession

504
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,860
that's a game huge huge gain from your

505
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,840
size they are legitimately trying to

506
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:08,260
amuse it CAPTCHA where applicable or

507
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:11,679
reCAPTCHA any would be the you get not

508
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:12,460
robots

509
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,290
click the click a question you're done

510
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:16,270
anyone knows their community they're

511
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,000
competing books in years this monkey

512
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,920
obvious there's a new recapture that

513
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,830
your actions all you probably don't know

514
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,210
that because you don't see it it's

515
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:29,170
actually off the page you're busy SS or

516
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:31,990
is my brain somewhere and how that works

517
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:35,140
is just Google's reputation of you so if

518
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:38,530
you ever are the Panda repetitive

519
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:40,630
music a caption here you know so much

520
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:42,550
you need to be monitored as I can I can

521
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:45,100
group forces things go in the incognito

522
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,620
mode or in private inspire call and see

523
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:50,380
if you happen to be a captain or see if

524
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:52,990
your usual kickbox but not a robot turns

525
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:55,360
into a click all the cat pictures or

526
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,590
find all the signs animal can outsource

527
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:03,520
their and legacy right because what

528
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,930
Google is doing is they below these

529
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:07,210
first part is looking on you that

530
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:09,820
they're referencing to know hey this guy

531
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,190
this is what we got right it goes with

532
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:16,780
Google a lot he goes to Gmail we are

533
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,520
Emily cookies new artery Halloween

534
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,990
analytics we know we've got a robot

535
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:22,300
there's humor identity is Perl script

536
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,100
those cookies are going to go on your

537
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,350
Perl script 12 dozen now that Perl

538
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:28,870
script is being thrown about a caption

539
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:30,940
where your users are either cooking a

540
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,620
chat box or all you have to do anything

541
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:36,520
all right so the day's a look at this

542
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,870
how you pictured or breaking your

543
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:41,380
schedule is buggy picture outsource with

544
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:45,070
my picture to put bar somewhere those

545
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:49,270
days are numbered and at the end of the

546
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:51,640
day if you're paying for a service like

547
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,940
a bird feed or what have you - a kind of

548
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:57,400
even though in the arms of Bloomberg but

549
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,170
you're paying for some other speed I

550
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:01,900
will getting it up to date sound ribbit

551
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,240
it's a great idea and the user once you

552
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,150
reach out for both of the date but

553
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:08,530
catching in that type of context when

554
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:11,080
you're paying for data for user makes

555
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:16,450
the whole head of loss 10 okay um this

556
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:18,910
one is API keys leakage

557
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,500
I know everyone's probably thinking

558
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,680
about it it's again but there's some

559
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,630
really good stories here and these are

560
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:28,260
really really important to protect um

561
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:33,310
how many of you have seen her of a BITC

562
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,680
beacon Co

563
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:41,070
Rico right yeah I was doing an

564
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,990
assessment in a while that update at the

565
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:46,080
end solution and whatever reason the NBN

566
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,600
provider it want to give the copy of

567
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:52,860
their SDK the next you have to be get to

568
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:55,830
be a customer to see our software

569
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,690
development kit like what I want to

570
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,850
iterate the I as I'm tester you know

571
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,800
we're going to responsibly to close this

572
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,630
up through your customer I got a big guy

573
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:06,510
now you need on the license book or

574
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:10,200
we'll give you our our SDK so pop it in

575
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,450
as I did it was gonna get someone has a

576
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:14,730
full listing on yet I'm going through it

577
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:18,000
into the major retail major retailer has

578
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,670
a full copy of the MVS SBA so not only

579
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:26,160
that they had their API key hard-coded

580
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:31,560
to it on disk Oh Mike no this won't work

581
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,080
cuz I should rip it heaven works but

582
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,600
should let them know if it so those and

583
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,910
have expose and it's right guess it'll

584
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:39,450
work

585
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:42,030
you know come one of those things always

586
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:44,900
ending up to your imagination

587
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,900
yeah so it doesn't happen all the time

588
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,220
willingly or unwillingly people are

589
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,800
putting adi feeds into their source code

590
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,050
repos and then exposing those every goes

591
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:57,300
out for those internet doesn't get an

592
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,280
untaught but you want to sound like hey

593
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:02,970
I grow a guy II that breach on github

594
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:05,970
House passes optimize another 90 seconds

595
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:08,790
bumpers making up same bitters cause

596
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:11,040
it's crazy for different permutations of

597
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:16,800
API team so don't do that all other

598
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,480
types does open source intelligence I

599
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,390
haven't worked with a guy symptoms

600
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,550
protected to my manager he created cool

601
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:27,290
call of a freak on Angie and her real ng

602
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:31,850
instant created that who and yes yeah

603
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:34,080
okay

604
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,160
oh so there's all the great modulo my

605
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,980
here it's assistant out his tool but if

606
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:41,800
you're looking for

607
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:45,280
or intelligence recon in g zom use it in

608
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,890
see what kind of crazy data you can get

609
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:49,630
that every once awhile we'll have a

610
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:51,370
client who wants to do with the truly

611
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:54,550
blackbox assessments okay again and if

612
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,140
you get in then maybe we'll give you

613
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:59,620
prayers but it adverse and again come

614
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,420
back to be with pages and pages and

615
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:05,680
pages of credential dumps and source

616
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,390
code repos and all kinds of stuff and

617
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:10,030
the essence our experiences all right

618
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:12,700
for me to be creative easy school of the

619
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,350
birth engineering just really up it

620
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:18,610
plays the thick client app html5 i side

621
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:21,310
of stuff or mobile apps right give a

622
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:24,460
mobile app knows someone is reversing

623
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:28,240
that someone is to look at that actually

624
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,860
some folks in this room from from SDI or

625
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:38,140
certain are probably looking at that so

626
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,870
no there's you harmful apip no matter

627
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:42,730
how you try to often it no matter what

628
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:45,070
you do to try to spaghetti slow that

629
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:47,110
thing together runtime someone's going

630
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:47,680
to figure that out

631
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,360
someone's going to do your api key and

632
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,450
if it's not harden or you know something

633
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:54,730
that it should be able to be seen by

634
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:58,000
outsiders it's going to be used on fire

635
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,210
picked up local file inclusion and

636
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:03,310
directory traversal right so I'm

637
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:05,170
presenting on anyone see here to ask you

638
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:07,870
week's creds cannot an article about a

639
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:09,430
big attach right hander something or

640
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:09,670
other

641
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:12,310
this was any of you like to break down

642
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:15,900
what happen on that step that goes to

643
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:19,150
speculations is showing that basically

644
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:21,970
those awesome sets read and then they're

645
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:26,080
that openness um fun money is on

646
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,910
something like this being the cause of

647
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:30,910
the leak of those I have any president

648
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:33,720
Saturn dollars but at the end of the day

649
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:38,440
that was my money my good work again

650
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,210
another colleague of mine John Poland

651
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:42,490
keeps without the trails dynamic

652
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:48,730
regardless I bought a real guy but this

653
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:51,430
is crazy thing if you if you google real

654
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,070
dynamic

655
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:54,800
durjan TV the person pops up these dudes

656
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,820
knowledge on bullet it's ridiculous levy

657
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,560
how you can get those file inclusions

658
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,260
and full bottle off of local file system

659
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,840
then you're going to store them in

660
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,560
places on the server they might be song

661
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:13,850
look there's another story on AP IP and

662
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:15,560
we'll remember this million dollar

663
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,980
Instagram does that brings the tunas

664
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:22,300
last year your name on the snuff ah

665
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,740
LinkedIn here and how to give out anyone

666
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:27,410
oh it caused a lot of drama there was

667
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:30,290
like this guy would say it did and I

668
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:32,540
would say most from Facebook with ain't

669
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,310
dead and the truth is probably somewhere

670
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,840
in between but let's just break down

671
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,390
what happened you can kind of see be

672
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:42,740
working so so I plugged on me both they

673
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,720
do a lot of recon they do a lot of

674
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,150
searching out there for like scope creep

675
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:49,190
because all the low-hanging fruit all

676
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:51,890
good stuff is done on like Facebook Tom

677
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:54,170
main they look what else is out there it

678
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:56,240
is owned by the same organization that I

679
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,160
could go freeze and break into and then

680
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,710
maybe you benefited something bigger so

681
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:02,780
the government's do this he found that

682
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:06,610
Instagram had external sense to basing

683
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:10,310
portals and it's the sense audacity to

684
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:14,000
some types of an interface and he tried

685
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,740
a bunch of like credentials up being

686
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,500
weak passwords get in all of the day

687
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,210
then he started doing some research and

688
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:22,070
realized that there was is remote code

689
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:24,700
execution vulnerability incentives oh

690
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:28,550
they see them leverage to then at the

691
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:30,470
back spread or creating an outward

692
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:32,420
selling time you can read this long if

693
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,740
you want to get the exact details but

694
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:36,830
what you then he found this config stuff

695
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:39,170
on fire which had to be WS key in the

696
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:43,070
config file which that's her Facebook

697
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,960
Likes cool we would give you 10 grand

698
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,580
for that you should have stopped there

699
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:51,590
but he did all he then took this and ran

700
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:54,260
over to the s3 auto scale bucket which

701
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:57,460
had additional keys in it

702
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:00,200
and he's not going he then took that and

703
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,690
went over the third bucket

704
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:05,270
but all the user made it in it and this

705
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:07,250
guy's indeed that's again how about a

706
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:09,680
facebook fraud and what user data visit

707
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,930
and this is completely outside of our

708
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,600
what a program and what happening but at

709
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,580
the end of the day it was this kita was

710
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:19,070
exposed who identified was available to

711
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:21,470
BMI lift system which should have never

712
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:24,080
been there and let's be honest you have

713
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,820
never been externally aging begin with

714
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:30,260
uh maybe I can filter if you don't have

715
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,180
certain sizes or jury bombs that's

716
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:35,960
whatever um when we're talking about API

717
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,840
key leakage remediation some is a pretty

718
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,390
free simple but like packages make sure

719
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:43,490
if you have something to close out to

720
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:46,390
the wild you're patching it right um

721
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:50,030
especially it's a admin portal or

722
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:53,120
something like that those expose on

723
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,920
necessary right if you have in Portal

724
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,250
try not to make an external be patient

725
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:00,380
what is it this is an interesting one

726
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:04,460
off with f3 and Burke are the key key to

727
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:07,220
the notion of the federal environment

728
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,410
they right now right you stand up a

729
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:11,450
one-time environment to do a data

730
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:13,550
transfer or you send up a one-time

731
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:17,810
environment to do X Y V bug bounty

732
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:19,640
hunters are going crazy right now

733
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,370
figuring out ways to great general

734
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:24,170
environment because even if their own

735
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:27,410
and for our or three hours or it's

736
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:30,490
participe torn down it's about it

737
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:34,010
they're usually let less harden then the

738
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:36,020
something you know is out there is easy

739
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:38,210
or out the cloud because that's data

740
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:41,060
little bit so if ever alarms are really

741
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,340
really big right now people are going

742
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:45,680
crazy looking for different ways there's

743
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,450
a bunch of interesting scripts out there

744
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:49,310
people have told to people of written to

745
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:51,460
try to enumerate ephemeral environment

746
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:55,070
before they're torn down and you know of

747
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,630
course they will trust no one right done

748
00:33:56,630 --> 00:34:00,920
exposure API keys of ability so wait

749
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:05,330
there's more um I'm just going to watch

750
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:07,550
for the biggest time and make sure I

751
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:10,250
confer questions here if I've got admin

752
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:13,790
portal it sounds silly people have admin

753
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:15,120
portal available to be

754
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,969
everywhere if you do that there's a very

755
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:20,280
good chance that your monkey hard-coded

756
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,469
correct that you forgot about or did you

757
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:25,380
know over a visited right or maybe it's

758
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:28,290
not integrated to the sample that or a

759
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:31,980
bee that were you know rescue

760
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:34,110
organization is or maybe it ought to be

761
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:38,310
looked at or your your idea or whatnot

762
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:41,040
so as in portals are big baby size like

763
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,409
baseball things right if you don't have

764
00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:45,239
a period under database if you're making

765
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:47,850
a publicly accessible that's right for a

766
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:50,400
disaster on a piece here is Asians

767
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,719
everywhere I thought about that for

768
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:54,739
hours just because in some of that

769
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:57,510
header Lee is everyone seems you know

770
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,890
competitors that are coming back from

771
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:00,990
web servers anything lately I mean it's

772
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:03,450
like this long of all the different

773
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:05,820
headers and basically for its own

774
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:08,700
existence and whatnot be cognizant that

775
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,370
people are echoing that better from your

776
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:13,350
server that's all go you're fine

777
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:14,670
all you have to do is look at it and

778
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:18,180
they are looking at it and possibly some

779
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,620
credentials something obviously this is

780
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:22,170
right everywhere one thing kiddos I just

781
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:24,240
wanted to say our peoples litter with

782
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:28,440
password ratcheting anyone so time for

783
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,870
rapid at a1 shaking head back arresting

784
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:32,820
is basically today you have some old

785
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:36,210
leaked hash absolute MD pop right and

786
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:39,330
you want to pay how can we convert over

787
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:40,230
users

788
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:45,630
Tuesday Esther well instead of making it

789
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,130
so the UH next login the user

790
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:49,890
credentials will be upgraded experts you

791
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:53,160
just ratchet the one into the next one

792
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,220
so for instance if user logged in and

793
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:00,000
they have an entry podcast what you

794
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,920
would first do is check to see if that

795
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,310
cash match is the first algorithms and

796
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:07,320
it doesn't then you use the first

797
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,610
algorithm to feed into the second

798
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:10,200
algorithm help said you've updated all

799
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,760
your passwords to do

800
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,080
memories are the password system and

801
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,850
uses ratcheting one feeding it in

802
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:18,450
together

803
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:21,240
right so I'm not a long time if you want

804
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,670
that easy step to basically take your

805
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:25,770
old allocation either encrypting fridge

806
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:30,900
or your non memory hard ashes and

807
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:35,550
upgrade them to something like a trip so

808
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:39,420
this is still where we are at the end of

809
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:43,110
the day the other actively say is either

810
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:45,600
lot of stuff just by reading up on lost

811
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,640
reading bug bounties reports those other

812
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:51,630
sorts are awesome um one a local company

813
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:53,940
uber who are has a fantastic value

814
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:56,520
business by after one but they have

815
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,830
insane report on from the walls that

816
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:03,260
were found by their bug bounties earth

817
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,760
and you read through them you can see

818
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,710
little typically right oh man I would

819
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:10,200
have just gone this extra step or if

820
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,200
uber would not have done this XYZ way

821
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,290
knocking maneuver but it's a really

822
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:18,869
great tool out there that we can learn

823

workers season as far as going actually

829
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:45,570
penetration test yeah yeah so there's a

830
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:47,430
great question the question was what

831
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:49,050
falls in particular methodology

832
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:51,619
framework org like you to use my gut I

833
00:37:51,619 --> 00:37:54,060
would be lying on a date dopey through

834
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,380
that I certainly do

835
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,780
there certainly mythology script that I

836
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,790
run through things that I do when I'm

837
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:01,770
starting off an assessment to get a

838
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:04,140
little covered them a Buick at the end

839
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,520
of the day I'm going to spend my time on

840
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,070
VP forgiveness blog applause I was might

841
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:09,570
have looking for the most critical

842
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:10,710
things that I can find for an

843
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:11,820
organization when I'm doing an

844
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,470
assessment and those are not gonna be

845
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:16,350
the things that are found by methodology

846
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:18,869
and coverage in terms of capsule white

847
00:38:18,869 --> 00:38:20,940
blanket or really have to narrow in so I

848
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,940
use a

849
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:25,430
and I use different tooling to get that

850
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:27,410
coverage of the methodology framework

851
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:29,720
and then I start breaking off what's

852
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,460
going to constable another source

853
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:38,289
