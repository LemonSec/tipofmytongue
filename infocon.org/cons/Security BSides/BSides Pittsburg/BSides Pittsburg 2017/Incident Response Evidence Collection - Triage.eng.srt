1
00:00:02,449 --> 00:00:06,270
all right mom pickle not enjoying

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:10,200
without difficulty we have John Mayer

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,849
here two years in our country analyst

4
00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:17,760
Kubrick he told clients both their peter

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,340
spierig office she has worked on a wide

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,890
range of engine spirit including in side

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,070
effects ABT colorized and holler

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,920
algorithm in popular today it's his

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,820
response and how it speeds or fail an

10
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,950
impression and as a lot of them may not

11
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,350
know it's really important they collect

12
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,590
the right of it at the right time for

13
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,100
today due to some issues we have the

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,020
content think we're going to be denied a

15
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,420
demo but who these movements to

16
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,570
Bertolini demonstrate the sickness so

17
00:00:51,570 --> 00:01:03,149
here we get the time yes i wanted to do

18
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:05,339
a live demo but look at the perfection

19
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:09,380
doing that oh my god amazing extra ah

20
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,210
I'm sure mother so I can configure it to

21
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,970
response analyst is security how do i

22
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:18,479
role is to accident go back and respond

23
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,790
significant for fun let's find time our

24
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,280
outbreak or some kind of generating or

25
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,479
something like that where they needed to

26
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,100
respond services or private services

27
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,840
then they come through my team in there

28
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,939
we people provide that so we'll help

29
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:32,070
them energy is negative Brenda will do

30
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,970
look at the amount amount for that and

31
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,189
the other side of the house that we do

32
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:41,040
is they actually train our clients and

33
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,020
how do people can respond so we want to

34
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,850
get on with their in some spots player

35
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,950
love them develop rut looks and then for

36
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,390
the longer clients eyes hold on people

37
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,579
top scenarios where we will actually

38
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:51,869
explain the client to run three

39
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:53,220
different scenarios within a very

40
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,350
responsible you know there's a couple

41
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,110
scenarios are relevant and posted bound

42
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,240
responses to delay okay and you can ask

43
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,560
you guys the same work region what is

44
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,360
your instance marking points two minutes

45
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,450
and then I went to those challenges

46
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,920
part is this is material for HP

47
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,788
enterprise that reviewing

48
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:12,969
caught up here to go around a while and

49
00:02:12,969 --> 00:02:15,549
I do have a home laughs and some of the

50
00:02:15,549 --> 00:02:17,290
things I have in my homeland security

51
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,689
onion I have a fog reading servers on

52
00:02:19,689 --> 00:02:22,090
image clients also how the people box it

53
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,069
up so I could get out a little bit all

54
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:26,379
that if I'm not doing computer geek

55
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:28,780
stuff I think their room is back run so

56
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,280
I'm outside Bernadette walked on and

57
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,470
your follicle apply mini burger teacher

58
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,030
so evidence question look at the neck

59
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,519
 up come look about why you want

60
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,560
eclectic I want to collect evidence

61
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,900
which one collective expertise

62
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:48,609
construction module onto my left hand

63
00:02:48,609 --> 00:02:52,599
biggest reason is one connects to do now

64
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:55,389
root cause what are a bit positive

65
00:02:55,389 --> 00:02:57,819
article evidence University okay we got

66
00:02:57,819 --> 00:02:59,980
some kind of security and then tapping

67
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,599
on your network you know some kind of

68
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,629
security control today at some point

69
00:03:04,629 --> 00:03:06,609
it's plot in order to understand where

70
00:03:06,609 --> 00:03:08,319
that process failure to be some kind of

71
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,120
rethought analysis in order to do that

72
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,189
the extra copies lecture later on

73
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:13,959
American regulatory regions water type

74
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:17,169
of evidence rediscovery lawsuits to

75
00:03:17,169 --> 00:03:19,239
guarantee our technology like sometimes

76
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:22,000
people from princess does not very

77
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,400
recent storm evidence and again you want

78
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,139
to try and improve your product so in

79
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,310
order to really understand what happened

80
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,900
in the crooked processes you have to

81
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:34,810
understand with a be profitable so when

82
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,790
you want to collect in it you want to

83
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:40,030
cut the decisions possible so you're

84
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,229
going to have to define when you're

85
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:43,750
going to collect a better condition you

86
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,760
can't collect heaven every time bars

87
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,949
left pops up or these are disinfected

88
00:03:47,949 --> 00:03:49,569
with a piece of modify or anything like

89
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:51,609
that but if you actually defined some

90
00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:53,129
scenarios we're going to left evidence

91
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:57,430
our entrees we be pumpkins final ravages

92
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,260
of you how can you start looking at

93
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,150
collective everything looks situated as

94
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,680
you actually want to pick up this

95
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,229
response time you click better if you

96
00:04:05,229 --> 00:04:06,609
want to cook it as soon as possible

97
00:04:06,609 --> 00:04:09,069
after the event we've had clients come

98
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:11,769
to us in your past and this is Nick want

99
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:14,290
relief and they want to know what

100
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,079
happened on its laptop of a rien a store

101
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,250
red bow electron or cleaned out first

102
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,980
and forever over the last be very does

103
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,840
say what you can become about it this

104
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,630
tastes inaudible lot is you destroy

105
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:29,210
everything I could look at material but

106
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,310
actually so the fact that we have it in

107
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,440
person is possible I'm belated beginning

108
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,620
of the engineering particular and you

109
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,770
wanted 20 minutes prior to running your

110
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:42,740
mouth like remediating situation or you

111
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,060
guys get on there and so they get on

112
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,850
boss I come from a I see I'm in Accra

113
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:49,250
and I know when I was in that role the

114
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,750
first thing I want to do get on the boss

115
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,520
realized these were times whatever

116
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,710
problem or Adam and pitches on you on

117
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,930
Atlas c'mon away when you're handling

118
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,940
interesting together this setting policy

119
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,919
number created you team welcomes their

120
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:03,290
their IP apartment building experience

121
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:06,110
response you try and make it very clear

122
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,240
answers exciting public actions like

123
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,680
that evidence first and preserve it

124
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,050
before that with started orientation

125
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:16,070
there's also going to be fourth out

126
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,830
there I primarily that the ginger and

127
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,270
takes broken imager is another one

128
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,760
eating works if you're on Linux box to

129
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,210
all those rules Evert you want to have

130
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:29,030
to enter into the new clutch SDK imager

131
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,740
and in page when you click this image

132
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,479
they'll actually go to ask for that

133
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,640
evidence whenever it busted so you want

134
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,800
her to ask available if you're not using

135
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,979
medical reason DD then you can use other

136
00:05:38,979 --> 00:05:42,229
tools like 85 summer sometime get to get

137
00:05:42,229 --> 00:05:44,750
a Selectric see other lucky then we even

138
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,979
clear that the others have to change

139
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:49,010
since you've taken and then you want to

140
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,960
create American coffee to actually work

141
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,250
on that edge so you're doing your

142
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,320
analysis your forensics going to

143
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,820
actually be working on working talking

144
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,740
four copies of that original either you

145
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,169
want to conserve that original weapon in

146
00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:02,450
case something goes wrong book for us if

147
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:03,919
you have some can screw up on your first

148
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,479
station or something like that and we're

149
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:07,700
about to get deleted or some otherwise

150
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,620
rusted if you still have the original

151
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,660
copy you can still get another copy fill

152
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,790
command to get the situation you swap a

153
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:18,410
little time on the type of evidence can

154
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,990
we inquire you can quite a memory which

155
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:23,540
is the activated system on on the device

156
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:26,960
even or other 50 nations 250 perfect

157
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,270
copy of this goods device or whatever

158
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,720
whatever

159
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,780
beautiful ice nuclear attraction and I

160
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,720
can't get Baba so proxy law firewall

161
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,660
laws is more expensive things and then

162
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,220
other effects evidence they put peak

163
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,750
jockeys you have to go to be test

164
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,870
capture network data travel tourism your

165
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,540
network you can get this key tasks

166
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,860
editors get files or something like that

167
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,500
if you want to grab if you have some

168
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,180
kind of cloud backup solution in your

169
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,920
kitchen there's all kinds of different

170
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,200
when you're current remember you want to

171
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,150
ask a few questions on the first one can

172
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,560
be how they can have because you got to

173
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,810
put that every summer I feel if you want

174
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,820
to have an external hard drive it's got

175
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,280
that number two so you have an external

176
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,050
guy that you convert into the laptop or

177
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,310
user device and you can save your number

178
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:17,940
to that if you don't have that storage

179
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,310
and you have to register the biskits

180
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:23,700
stuff than anything you can user get AF

181
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,280
from the network ocular go if you think

182
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,990
it is religious nuts to market bug and I

183
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,450
previously gotten hit your truck your

184
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,850
country remember that way if you've got

185
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,980
a server in data center and you have

186
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,900
very screwed change controls an update

187
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,550
Center about what you can and can't go

188
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,230
into those servers that you file maybe

189
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,690
not okay right now and you're going to

190
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,280
have to figure out some other way to get

191
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,460
that memory off that servers to a lot of

192
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:51,630
these like I said Gillian says it's nice

193
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:54,930
to have an extra music store times you

194
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,880
can buy covered exists but the one

195
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,919
caveat to that is it devices with disk

196
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:01,020
and you might feel the right unallocated

197
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:05,330
space any other may have been a mess

198
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:12,060
okay this is really doing a live demo

199
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,400
with entertain proportions that you do

200
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,910
that at all guys but it's a if they're

201
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,530
program that you can download necklace

202
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:22,080
data and the feeling interface because a

203
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,060
couple versions is the like version

204
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,590
which is you don't have to actually

205
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,120
install anything you can run it up a

206
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,740
business drive and then there's an

207
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,350
actual install version be installed on

208
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:35,760
Tyson and run the the installed versions

209
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,799
motoric recent summer main things and

210
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,029
the light versions which are new

211
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:41,520
preferences in cases where we have to

212
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,770
keep her on construction top

213
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:47,310
so it's capturing the image image is as

214
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,350
simple as open up McEwing second on fire

215
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:58,589
and there's a capture memory acquiring

216
00:08:58,589 --> 00:09:00,960
this image not the sweet spec times

217
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,730
questions are going to be needed at the

218
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:05,279
current situation public spaces on the

219
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,310
bit so you have a 500 gig hard drive you

220
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,470
have a terabyte hard drive how much

221
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,570
space destinies on these an honor tapes

222
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:13,980
out they review the cool air file

223
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,560
because then you have to find a medium

224
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,420
to put that data whenever you're

225
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,330
actually tapping the other question you

226
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,190
want to know is is encrypted

227
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,260
almost everybody go out there can

228
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,760
support hit lock are in the major

229
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,160
compression programs in the together to

230
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,440
plug-in enterprise market robotics you

231
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,500
can get better cheap so you can use that

232
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,600
but if you don't have an access to the

233
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,610
keys or maybe it's some subject this

234
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,290
year you don't have access to in here to

235
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,180
see if any you don't want to get a

236
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,500
physical drug is I'm going to get

237
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,870
logical drive so that your marketing

238
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:49,410
purposes and then be my physical or

239
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,240
logical image again another reason for

240
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,420
that my feet raid every Brenda's go out

241
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,950
there with a day support raid and you

242
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,810
can take internal images of great device

243
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,550
and then stitch it back together and be

244
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,530
able to present to the data and practice

245
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:02,790
that works about ninety percent of time

246
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:06,480
so what we do in my organization is do

247
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,910
is run grab a logical image of great

248
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:11,690
servers for honor to ditch assets is

249
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:14,279
amazing if we ask one issue with the

250
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:16,230
brain epi day with effective forensic

251
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,570
tools and still have an image of the

252
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:20,810
server

253
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,829
and this is where I did a lot of demo

254
00:10:24,829 --> 00:10:27,170
damage your own band together have that

255
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:29,390
but again once you have it GUI up you

256
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,399
can search by out and create this image

257
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:32,950
and there's bump it up all your

258
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:41,300
attention before I not quite what the

259
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,160
first things you want to do is find out

260
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,959
if the lobster dinner bar actually

261
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,720
relevant and have the data that you want

262
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,350
and I in situations like this make sure

263
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,149
you get your follow along while robots

264
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:55,040
will typically record the IP address I

265
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,660
don't borrow a lot of a lot of the

266
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,740
domain names so if you're actually

267
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,720
looking for a mega names and you look in

268
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,279
your file below that's main name you

269
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,680
might not find information convert

270
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,360
that's a name into a nice to get dressed

271
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,480
because it's a firewall attack same for

272
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,250
proxy locks once in love technically how

273
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,990
the survey today but maybe not an FPS

274
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:15,140
and reverse the script maybe need to

275
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,670
know how big the log files are because

276
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,269
you have to get them some of using

277
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:21,769
uncommon consulted talking back off

278
00:11:21,769 --> 00:11:23,480
whenever a time to gauge us and they're

279
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,820
delivering props to us if we're not

280
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,199
already exist in work at over two

281
00:11:27,199 --> 00:11:29,269
thousand eight month sometimes story or

282
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:33,440
some puppy you get to us and then you I

283
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,570
asked if they can be pushed I bring this

284
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,399
up because circular thoughts are a

285
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:40,490
binary format and you can insert an

286
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:41,990
artist check one well on different

287
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:45,230
questions there's lovely to do that but

288
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:47,690
if your opponent binary file off giving

289
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:50,480
it media third party if I don't have the

290
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,250
check play infrastructure in places to

291
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,779
put that file and I won't be able to do

292
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:56,120
that and prove that the text model Tom

293
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,649
we have a lot of clients will bring on a

294
00:11:57,649 --> 00:11:59,570
deliverer file again in text format

295
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:01,910
because it's easier for us to parse and

296
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:04,149
it's less expensive event pay for

297
00:12:04,149 --> 00:12:10,250
concert yet make sure you have a limited

298
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:18,800
funds and another nice demo here it's

299
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,519
going technology was founded yeah maybe

300
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:27,199
the next one okay Evan extry Ives what

301
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:28,640
I'm talking about here is figuring out

302
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,779
what evidence you want to look what

303
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:31,069
first again I come from a wealthy

304
00:12:31,069 --> 00:12:32,779
backgrounds of ever getting nation in

305
00:12:32,779 --> 00:12:34,520
business usually have a fine

306
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,900
throw in a bunch of different editing

307
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,400
sets we're going to get images from

308
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,680
career for devices and memory loss files

309
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,840
all the sort of evidence is coming in

310
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,060
you need to sit down and figure out what

311
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,220
you need to look at first and prioritize

312
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,540
where you're going to find get the most

313
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,790
bang for your buck time step so you want

314
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:52,010
to try and focus on hi gunner gluttons

315
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:53,690
for a particular patient that you're

316
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,320
working on so here's a couple of dances

317
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,460
say they will work on a phishing email

318
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,290
page where Christians know is used to

319
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:02,960
install malware so now you know there's

320
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,700
gonna be much different luck available

321
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,950
we've got to think about what the most

322
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,610
important or where the most high

323
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:11,090
priority is vs real action no problem so

324
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,950
to do a phishing email then you're

325
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,960
probably going to skin cloth get peel

326
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,450
off maybe there's gonna be memory memory

327
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:19,220
is there's going to be action to them

328
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,590
some remnants on the fifth a natural

329
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:23,540
phishing email so there's a few kinds of

330
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,250
places where you want to look for refine

331
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:28,000
that patient's you never see if you can

332
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,710
find out where install then the

333
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,060
concentrations you're going to look at

334
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,650
are under this and you're going to want

335
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:35,870
to look at again file see if that file

336
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:38,660
to install maybe this run that the

337
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,050
screen with our team converts to say

338
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:43,550
possibly there's possible to part of all

339
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,800
office hours talking up to a community

340
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,260
closest location of the internet you

341
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,170
might have lots of data in memory when

342
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:52,460
offering processes and network

343
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,470
connections and those sorts of things is

344
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:58,130
irrelevant here takes another example

345
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,480
that you have fit to the company

346
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,730
documents on page then nobody wants to

347
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:03,410
wake up that person amorous teachers

348
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:06,440
into done drop-off casement but if you

349
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,210
have that kind of situation you can try

350
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:09,440
to have to figure out how you're going

351
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,750
to find that it's kind of a broad think

352
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,420
so catches the documents things you want

353
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,100
to think of is where are those documents

354
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,650
of glass that's been give you the scope

355
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,320
of using that might have has something

356
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,720
happen on the devices and then you're

357
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,490
going to want to shoot you know where

358
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,080
would you find that information serving

359
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,860
SharePoint box PLP losses get big loss

360
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:34,370
prevention installing new network 80-odd

361
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:35,960
applause if you have certain ought to be

362
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,820
enabled you can tell them to watch files

363
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,770
and do files or anything like that and

364
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,330
those look like you're else you get some

365
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:43,100
numeric data

366
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,970
bunch of slides basically some page hey

367
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,740
spin the questions you want to ask if

368
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,120
you could be scenarios are maybe you had

369
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,280
a Kenosha's insider or maybe it was a

370
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,230
hacker put in your and demo you gotta

371
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:56,330
consider both those scenarios and you've

372
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,650
got to think about the difference might

373
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:00,760
be to support or exclude those periods

374
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:04,250
thrown over 40 meters like images or

375
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:08,120
endpoint images rocks logs by the log if

376
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,340
they're actually uploading this stuff

377
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,480
with you've got your corporate network

378
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,700
to paste in you know that you might

379
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,260
actually have a recognized we're taking

380
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:20,480
that self out good but then the other

381
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,370
thing is looking for is two signs of a

382
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:24,320
dislocation so the hacker came in

383
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,940
they're definitely their mode of

384
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,740
operation into finally sent two

385
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,450
documents their role authenticity they

386
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,760
can put some into a archive file or zip

387
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,190
file or what file then they move them up

388
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:36,380
another so you may look for evidence of

389
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,940
that activity having the privilege

390
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:41,110
through traffic

391
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,070
traduction hundreds hundreds or 15 years

392
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,990
is volatility involved instructors about

393
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:51,020
genes and databases I'll use volatility

394
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,120
for you to do a lot of the numbering

395
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,520
office itself look at running processes

396
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,130
network connections those sort of things

397
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:00,110
against this is tree there's a kind of

398
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,940
things that were looking at whenever I

399
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,380
have a memory initial first thing next

400
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,670
day a couple things I guess going to

401
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,020
look at is what processes are running

402
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,870
the memory and what network connections

403
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,460
that's wise talking to this let's

404
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,870
continue quaternary things we usually

405
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,120
that'll lead you to other areas in the

406
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,210
memory that you want to look at another

407
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,160
connection is oval it difficulties next

408
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,050
game on the descendant and continuing on

409
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:23,600
Windows XP hopefully nobody's to running

410
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,060
the desert scanner by Ernest but based

411
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,830
on the waterfront virus currently

412
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,480
they're still our organization to have

413
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:34,460
it out there so it will be on color

414
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,530
other eligible for affectionate fond

415
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:39,200
memory of user accounts encryption key

416
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,260
if you have ransomware solvability

417
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:45,740
memory URLs registries and that explored

418
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,090
history all those sorts of things can be

419
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,200
found in learn during may be well

420
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,680
computers you can also pull up in at

421
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,010
people

422
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:58,310
okay they have to disk image finally

423
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,590
triage that you kind of have a focus on

424
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,690
where the artifacts repeat is irrelevant

425
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,760
for the personal feelings see up there

426
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,550
understanding which will again it's

427
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:10,369
almost to use at DK in cases are big one

428
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:13,400
I played fifth birthday smallest music

429
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,150
tips on the NFP will show you the

430
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,980
positive on system so if you want to

431
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,599
know if some file has been on there

432
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,490
these Rancic you visited or our install

433
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,260
or something like that in it be the

434
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,550
really good resource to look for those

435
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:28,730
kinds of things the registry center that

436
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:30,710
basic spent a report on exchanges on

437
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:33,050
system of iteration stuff so again if

438
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,180
you're looking for something that

439
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,740
installed or JSON system errors being on

440
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:43,280
those lines and I get under your brows

441
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,510
of injury that kind of self-explanatory

442
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,580
you want to find out if user actually

443
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,920
click on that fishing link and went out

444
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,500
to a URL downloaded that malware that

445
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,940
user is remarkable that's off the record

446
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:59,630
Smith is events that popular always have

447
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:02,830
is I want they always fit it's

448
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:05,270
underrated what the event must have on

449
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:07,040
system I always try market event log in

450
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,420
every system I look at you never know

451
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,380
what you're going to find even with

452
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,390
default settings on to those in the

453
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,010
closet for you you still find good

454
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,840
information and your vet blogs about

455
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,900
what happened on the system at important

456
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,670
times or whose money is coming off the

457
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:22,070
system to log on log off if somebody's

458
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,540
trying to use lateral movement and

459
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,890
running web services that's always

460
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,750
gaming you can find internet box so

461
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,090
there's kind of dangers to finding big

462
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:29,420
ones

463
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,660
then of the relevant laws like antivirus

464
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,150
logs on there most of our logs under the

465
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:37,070
shorter check those out to you sometimes

466
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,750
those will be to your investigation in

467
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,000
surprise what the end of our supports oh

468
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,830
we've seen this violence and cut down

469
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,930
and get install below you can stock so

470
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:46,970
please they clean it but they did

471
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:51,010
actually stopping section who she ever

472
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:57,679
ah true Russian balls and I'm from Essex

473
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,170
from far away as long as our Sun with

474
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:02,059
which he next so you have a kind of

475
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:03,770
event to happen under heckler whether

476
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:06,080
it's my DSLR or some other event like

477
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,059
that got a date sometime hopefully on

478
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:08,900
one second

479
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,000
so if you sort of like you know and look

480
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,799
at your watch from there off I'm used to

481
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,270
thinking through things and because laws

482
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,890
you can't just look at that stuff line

483
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,660
by line I'd actually have clients on

484
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,220
Apollo saying yeah we're looking well

485
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,440
upon my wand and that's the wrong way to

486
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,870
different off you actually have to find

487
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,040
out what you want to look for in

488
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,880
searching that you start pushing out and

489
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,320
you look for activity around that and

490
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,510
with that known event

491
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,070
so again and I will to lower together

492
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:36,440
and prototype together somewhat weren't

493
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,700
after and kind of get an idea of what

494
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,280
and Derek at the front were you looking

495
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,500
for unknown back and we do get that

496
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,049
quite a bit more than you do actually

497
00:19:48,049 --> 00:19:50,270
but it does happen that you want to

498
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,919
start built or not known good this is

499
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,660
where correct one is usual from which

500
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,850
you can actually look for known good IP

501
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:58,250
addresses no biggie or Alice Microsoft

502
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,110
offi home a source of energy directly at

503
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:03,049
high information see that it's no good

504
00:20:03,049 --> 00:20:07,190
and then we suppress that reference

505
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:09,020
being then you left with the other

506
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:16,370
something loans ok foot more story he

507
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:18,230
hasn't been changed because I want to

508
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:20,299
pick up significant view but this is

509
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:21,830
current off process that we went through

510
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:26,330
a different pace clearly in feedback and

511
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:26,840
response

512
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,490
there's always something coming down

513
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:31,520
belonging to the team's work but this is

514
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,850
one of the genie point so fires fish

515
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:35,630
we're going to say that your user

516
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,669
account they will compromise maybe users

517
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:39,500
and operators so they don't even fish

518
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,380
the user now to compromise their users

519
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,970
announced letting us p.m. and they never

520
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:47,480
say so they found sufficient out from

521
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,940
some of users there's fifty artisans of

522
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,280
all they come Kristen email and it's not

523
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,870
that may be plenty of those users we

524
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,820
want to know the other you know although

525
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,730
the third get has got the same fish and

526
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,530
different basically group uses different

527
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:04,190
places you know what happened so if you

528
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:08,410
wanted to know what else happens without

529
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,090
so looking at this from the solution

530
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:14,190
perspective the EPA solution would ban

531
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,799
they actually had in my monetary Intel

532
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,320
ago they've actually and their emails

533
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,590
for URLs and attachments BRL run mr.

534
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:24,809
standoff you know five luscious one to

535
00:21:24,809 --> 00:21:27,150
put ever view of course I was in college

536
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:30,990
which is quite a shock but it was

537
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,360
available to us if it's enough people to

538
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,049
contribute so next they say fingers are

539
00:21:37,049 --> 00:21:39,720
filed and I suspect we're throwing our

540
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,600
front it to education and reduce the

541
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,010
keyword searches maybe triathlon

542
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:46,740
something like that a little background

543
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,770
on their business processes part of a

544
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,630
lot of their business processes actually

545
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:55,080
relies on leaders send the documents and

546
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,770
PDF of other users with URL links inside

547
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:01,110
to support the difference product so

548
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,549
that is the way they were in the

549
00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:04,650
business of course that is a very high

550
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:07,020
account a very high false positive work

551
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:09,000
because you have all kinds of document

552
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,350
emissive on our entry reviews in

553
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:12,659
internal and external links run their

554
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:15,630
business but if you have a and do a

555
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:17,850
keyword searches for acoustic EP if your

556
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:20,520
house was going to take too long in

557
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:24,330
order to profit so you may want to

558
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:26,789
create files due to on pieces of Maya

559
00:22:26,789 --> 00:22:31,559
optics now it's going very well on on

560
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,270
phishing emails because generally it's

561
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:35,280
just the efficient unit a link to the

562
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,500
URL it's required if it's something that

563
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,539
went to follow up in a couple of eighty

564
00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:41,940
hit runners April 1115 are nothing

565
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,690
earth-shattering

566
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,400
there's no malware invented in it it's

567
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,990
not running sprints or anything like

568
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,240
that happening for houses it's just a

569
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,370
PDF file I can look outside and the

570
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,590
computer is clicking online ah

571
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:55,669
what I didn't notice was that it streams

572
00:22:55,669 --> 00:22:59,190
so with the strengthless being actually

573
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:02,030
this is the malicious URL which is good

574
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:05,120
then the downside was that I couldn't

575
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,770
feasibly running nine thousand across

576
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:09,510
PDF files through the bottom and

577
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,460
visually looking for strangers all

578
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,130
teachers again not something we want to

579
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:16,559
do so inside for the strengths command

580
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,630
on all these PDF files or

581
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,160
all the strings out of all of the PDF

582
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,620
files and their needs are other commands

583
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:25,760
in order to collect it out

584
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,360
so instructor the PDF files through in

585
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,880
strings - strings my staff will actually

586
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,250
prepend the filename of whatever string

587
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,840
is five and files so you'll have a

588
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,730
filename menu rather screen

589
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:40,890
piercing screams come in and run it

590
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:42,900
pulls all the ASCII characters out for

591
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,750
your foots in Manila so there's it's

592
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:47,400
baggage in there there's random

593
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,500
characters together and then there's a

594
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,980
few bits of useful information URLs made

595
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:56,610
sort of things so once would run that

596
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:59,220
the screens minus F and then we put it

597
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:02,190
into another file then what we can do is

598
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:05,280
we can prep on that biology to look at

599
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,020
the malicious URLs and those URLs

600
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,240
repetitive HTTP so if they're going to

601
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,860
do a better search on that and that

602
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:14,280
there is a list of every HTTP URL bar on

603
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,250
all those PDFs which it's a lot of data

604
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:18,750
together through but it creates a

605
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:21,170
solvable problem

606
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,440
so let's do that is you cook if remember

607
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,000
good dimensions so we know the mass

608
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,350
microsoft.com

609
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:30,480
probably not a malicious URL so I may

610
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,100
not agree with that on some people it's

611
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:35,930
generally good so to begin breath for

612
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:38,550
Microsoft Tom and you would do that

613
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:43,200
results so when you don't feel like

614
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,870
yourself up on all of what I do I use

615
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:49,350
the minefield - I often I actually do

616
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,640
the threat first for the particular

617
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,680
you're looking for and take Microsoft

618
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,060
and then Ottoman few those results

619
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,100
there's nothing in particular that I'm

620
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,570
looking for and I want to make sure that

621
00:24:57,570 --> 00:25:00,810
the a malware actor is not trying to

622
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:03,180
trick the users by having something to

623
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:06,930
missus Microsoft common is nothing

624
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:09,630
against onyx or Microsoft comments not

625
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:11,610
pretending to be news to you of your our

626
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:14,610
enemies so it would either cross you

627
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:16,680
really taking the perfect review best

628
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,260
product month and then any want the next

629
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,700
minute you're welcome

630
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:24,210
every calm the client inane what bomb so

631
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:26,160
all this interview you could do that

632
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,110
then at the end of that process you

633
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,420
actually have live down I'm going your

634
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,580
Alice it's no fun twist

635
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:35,740
pretty good very intelligent speed or

636
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,920
any other tools processes box turtle

637
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,710
Google whatever other process you not

638
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:44,710
release to find out that it will just

639
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:50,110
you all that that's all I have for now I

640
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,370
was going to do another demonstration

641
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:53,920
but actually how efficient stuff am i do

642
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,620
right now live demonstration denied

643
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:59,830
apologize for that I apologize for the

644
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:02,410
technical problem but is any questions I

645
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:07,450
don't know long a question yeah we are

646
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:10,960
the five malware to analyze the rajaiah

647
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,580
if there's a whitewash out of it and the

648
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:20,380
other ah there are sites that actually

649
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:23,380
have now respond back

650
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,580
I don't remember the exact searching

651
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,440
others you there but there are sites out

652
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,690
there that haven't done it I just I just

653
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:31,030
going out to malware's do something on

654
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:33,010
public about a month ago if there are

655
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:34,300
safe out there hammock I don't have to

656
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:37,120
get to pump it but it's good typically

657
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,640
come do some speed but as far as unit

658
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,430
about to be do validation comes in our

659
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:47,880
houses its what's the decision process

660
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:51,070
that you see your client units or they

661
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:53,980
can incision whether to go and trying

662
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:57,400
people are my will be fabulous

663
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,430
persons of cause or what we're a similar

664
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:02,530
trick they think about me they say

665
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:04,690
should we pursue this is really the one

666
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:07,720
off cost of the big one on academic

667
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,790
council is hulking background so which

668
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:11,410
is like I'm a materials cost and

669
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:14,230
everything gauge our team sometimes it's

670
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:16,480
a regulatory requirement is any kind of

671
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,950
recording or anything like that that's

672
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:20,010
going to play into how much

673
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:21,700
investigations are going to do where

674
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:24,540
they're required by some regulatory

675
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,350
requirement can actually investigate

676
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:31,000
whatever happens then that'll be again

677
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,440
off to the big line and then whether

678
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:36,400
there's any regulatory important for

679
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,910
statistics

680
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:48,660
[Laughter]

681
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:57,700
yes hello Fester

682
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,220
there are tools out there they can do

683
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,740
local analysis activated guidance all

684
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,600
the big names have something for mobile

685
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,160
general you're going to grab that phone

686
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,280
itself a lot of the newer phone they're

687
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,810
coming out with the iPhones are and all

688
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:13,050
about their error

689
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:15,670
encrypting their data so rather than

690
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:17,680
actual images talk a lot of what's

691
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,840
happening the fronton community is the

692
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,360
rely on like the iCloud backups and it's

693
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,830
Explorer per foot on some of the top

694
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:28,510
methods to get that be long if your

695
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:30,250
technique change at all you have to go

696
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:35,320
to work with fixer juice we operate on

697
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,180
the exception that we go to for most of

698
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:39,490
the problems go so you know easily we

699
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:41,320
collect our evidence if you obtain a

700
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,570
company all those sorts of things we

701
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:44,890
have processes in place on how we

702
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:47,740
actually do our outputs so that we'd

703
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,210
ever if you have to go to port and you

704
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:51,640
can specify those we operate on the

705
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,040
assumption to report negative work nine

706
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,760
percent ammonia

707
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:10,490
ah I don't have a clock back up and

708
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,770
smuggle it out this is it might be I'm

709
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:16,070
not an expert on it but the iPhone Astra

710
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,899
has backup which kind of makes it easier

711
00:29:17,899 --> 00:29:20,840
to be access to that file backup it's a

712
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,929
little bit easier to fit the data a lot

713
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:27,710
of Android you can connect with the loop

714
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:29,809
circuit license to get images but the

715
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:31,460
trick you're going to find with Android

716
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,440
as one you have a driver that particular

717
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,049
phone and do the forensics will support

718
00:29:36,049 --> 00:29:38,570
the gun seconds are up on newer cars

719
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,340
it's usually not an issue but if you get

720
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,260
to order phones or older models there

721
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:46,000
may not be drivers available in order to

722
00:29:55,990 --> 00:30:00,679
any other questions all right

723
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:03,200
um thank you for your time start with

724
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,960
the delicate work I apologize will John

725
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,760
do better next time

726
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:15,760
[Applause]
