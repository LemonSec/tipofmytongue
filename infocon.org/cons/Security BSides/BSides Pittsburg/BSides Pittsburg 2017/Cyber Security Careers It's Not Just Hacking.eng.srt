2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,230

4
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:12,690
thing of any dream but without the M so

technology service like you do

23
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,829
information to the community Eastern

24
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:58,379
Point is very what it means B is

25
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:01,920
technology for the zoo these ones on

26
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:11,070
safety diver thank you very much I'm

27
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,810
among everybody wants to eat in here

28
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,110
works grade pretty rare to get this many

29
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,290
people in a room at a tech training

30
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,330
conference to talk about the social

31
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,850
sciences and not exactly what we're

32
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,290
going to do so what I ask is that we all

33
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:30,119
get ourselves in that headspace because

34
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:32,189
we've got some challenges to solve

35
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:34,229
challenges that directly affect all of

36
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:36,060
us and that are what role you're in and

37
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,270
fiber or text message yourself with your

38
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,369
families and your friends and in this

39
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:45,780
country so the social science taught I

40
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,700
love to engaging and you sing got up

41
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,890
here I'm sit down there and walking

42
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,600
around and giving you the mic so don't

43
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,659
be afraid to raise your hands and tap in

44
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:55,950
a thing or whatever we thought that

45
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,649
model here we can make happen so let's

46
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:00,600
get into it is the first time I've been

47
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,840
in this talk it is vivid in the making

48
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,610
for quite some time

49
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,290
challenging to get to this next slide

50
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,440
I'll show you which is how many jobs are

51
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,480
really in fiber and what are they and

52
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,430
what are the roles and responsibilities

53
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:17,300
and skill sets that really pay because I

54
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,970
am sure you all see this word hacking up

55
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:23,610
here and fellow can get bill feeling

56
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,640
right are you in your hand if the word

57
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,200
hacking actually triggers you in any

58
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,440
capacity in the negative and raise your

59
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:31,770
hand

60
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,500
all right so so those are raising their

61
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,260
hand tight as well maybe not boxing a

62
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,590
lot of them and in their mind offenses

63
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:44,060
and say that's look who we are another

64
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:47,610
big pride enough is math term and is

65
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,130
neither a right or wrong so the

66
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,900
challenges what does it mean and what is

67
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,730
the world around us thinking when they

68
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,190
see this word if this is the word that

69
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,500
we use to describe fiber it's the word

70
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,410
on Lynn the word in print and it's those

71
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:04,950
limiting that we are behind in talent

72
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:08,100
and we are absolutely only selling these

73
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,190
careers we very small population which

74
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,660
is our national security issue

75
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:16,440
and so when I wrote this pocket was

76
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,019
released to say we've gotta really bring

77
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:21,260
ourselves to understand that hacking is

78
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,480
it is a term so it's good use by media

79
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,090
and it's limiting and we want to talk in

80
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,100
a greater level and greater capacity is

81
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,230
helping us understand what it is we all

82
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:31,709
do

83
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:34,260
he really back honor mainly confined her

84
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,019
since we're such an industry exited sex

85
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:40,470
since January of 94 and gotten five or

86
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,450
ten years early one drop of seven and

87
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:45,150
the reality is that we still don't have

88
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:48,150
a common language what an analyst is

89
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,190
said one organization is completely

90
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:53,250
different to another and so on so on and

91
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,470
as we know that's usually a result of

92
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,910
the fact that it's not training enough

93
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,670
people in the US or still restocks if

94
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:02,310
you're also doing green poor job at one

95
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,709
time and then some change over time is

96
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:07,049
in the meantime it's a struggle and is

97
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:08,640
wearing on our community you we're

98
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,030
seeing fatigue and seeing a lot of

99
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:12,910
turnover

100
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,650
right look that's got the idea of the

101
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,540
average amount of time let's keep

102
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,220
information security officer students or

103
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,200
job you know

104
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,540
here the spear plus eighteen months work

105
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:29,290
eighteen months this is not I think we

106
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:30,460
all know how long it takes to actually

107
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,800
understand the company and how it runs

108
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,590
and what it's doing and what is to keep

109
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,090
it end

110
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:39,400
and till we all know that it's pretty

111
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,490
part of the past remember mine really be

112
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,160
successful so we're seeing a long write

113
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,160
down a lot of right now and break down

114
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,100
means job changing so the title of this

115
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,890
talk is about our careers we need to

116
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,780
think socially about what we're all

117
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:59,290
doing and how we're selling our career

118
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,990
so first thing I want to show good - is

119
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,210
this slide

120
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:06,690
anybody got any ideas why I've got six

121
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,890
jobs that are in cyber

122
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:13,150
I was once because a lot back in the

123
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:17,800
back yeah I'm an absolutely not why I

124
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,310
highlighted it absolutely correct

125
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,610
anybody else

126
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:28,630
yeah you know I'm going to be backed up

127
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,000
momentum I get to realize the number one

128
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,360
answer because well these people and

129
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,760
enrolled are the baselines of what we

130
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,610
consider to be a homeless be tired of

131
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,950
that true not why I highlighted it yes

132
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:49,720
whoo oh good exactly I'll just the word

133
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,300
hacker up there I said every time we all

134
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,130
talk about fiber in this world did we

135
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,380
say the word hacker these are the six

136
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,710
roles that you must be able to break

137
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:06,400
into anything in order to participate in

138
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,000
these rules really of the horse-breaking

139
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,100
industry including on a team these as

140
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,590
well it doesn't mean not the focuser

141
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,150
leadership or the folks under the

142
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:19,240
federal role actually don't as

143
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,000
so that they may have that skill so it's

144
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,330
not required for their daily job when my

145
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:27,789
clients call me worth making dollars and

146
00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:30,490
we only work trying one me many Tigers

147
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,940
we are never asked for penetration

148
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:37,300
skills packing still in any other

149
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,770
position than these sticks that are

150
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:41,169
highlighted gear and so my point is a

151
00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:43,240
couple of things we're pointed in smooth

152
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,340
our Mountain the appointments here to

153
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,250
your sharing and we have a massive need

154
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,250
for them and it's actually the best area

155
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,199
to get that we're educating in our

156
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,940
schools are starting to catch up we're

157
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,800
starting to see more and more programs

158
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,080
for girls in terms of being role filming

159
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,270
more recent going around showing some

160
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,889
bleep went wrong in my next couple of

161
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:08,590
life but before we get to that what

162
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:11,650
we're also seeing here on replies is

163
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,840
there's a whole lot of jobs don't

164
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,789
require the most skill set that we're

165
00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:18,909
selling the country on that we need and

166
00:07:18,909 --> 00:07:22,240
the reality is there's a lot of other

167
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,909
positions so one of the things I noticed

168
00:07:24,909 --> 00:07:27,460

180
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:55,030
change to telepathic and my fiber

181
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,669
research in McGarrett Pittsburgh while

182
00:07:57,669 --> 00:07:59,349
we're here about this program run by

183
00:07:59,349 --> 00:08:01,180
Moshe bubbler and for some Erica

184
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:05,229
artifices here yep California exact CEO

185
00:08:05,229 --> 00:08:07,419
opening up their home to be a monster

186
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:11,020
out there telling young girl ill boy

187
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,719
dinner wise with all these offices but

188
00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:16,240
even if they don't have a massive rear

189
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,070
collector program innovation have

190
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:21,130
leadership role inside our organizations

191
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,599
in text company

192
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:25,449
we're not work towards in general we're

193
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:27,370
not are we ought to be because it's the

194
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:27,669
truth

195
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:30,790
and it does mean there are CEOs of

196
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,860
something that are highly technical it's

197
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,940
one of the others

198
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,390
typically meaning fail for technology

199
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:41,880
and the reality is these role part of

200
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,470
what we can ordered a bunch of your

201
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,930
community all of these roles take up a

202
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:49,810
call actually getting a paycheck because

203
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:52,240
meaning this we talking about the word

204
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,240
career this is how we obtain calories

205
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,420
solute over and how we feed our family

206
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,910
than ourselves because without everybody

207
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:01,930
on we list

208
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:04,360
we actually don't exist as a business

209
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,270
which is what we are and so because

210
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,820
we're not out there representing all

211
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,140
these different jobs we're really

212
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,850
struggling for struggling and getting

213
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:16,030
budgets or struggling work overload or

214
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:19,240
struggling in a lot of upset because

215
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,540
things go fo to no effort as plans and

216
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,120
then people get upset if my finger isn't

217
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,130
it not and then we have attrition and

218
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,300
this is what I've been watching since

219
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,730
I'm in the tech industry I see as much

220
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:33,940
more severely in fiber I worked out work

221
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,620
from st. banners for twenty years

222
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,390
orange our minds company or different

223
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,310
companies with them and their whole

224
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,680
model was trained in samosa within and

225
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,930
build companies work together you're

226
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:46,450
better off together there's a separate

227
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:49,720
these types of things so my my goal my

228
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,080
conscience is people of sociologists and

229
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,390
criminal justice major and level up

230
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,460
field as far to run comparisons what I

231
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,350
do every day think about people and

232
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,180
myself and all of us and how we make

233
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,060
this is why what's going on and housing

234
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:07,270
need have more folks in this community

235
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:10,480
and work at a greater capacity to stick

236
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,760
together and I do a lot of popular

237
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,110
opinion we're going to do that a little

238
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:16,810
bit today so anyhow questions thoughts

239
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:22,440
comments on the fly ideas anybody wah

240
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:31,480
yeah you just pissed that when we call

241
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,990
it an art problems meaning has nothing

242
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,880
to do all the subsets of what's

243
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,580
underneath these another I sense if you

244
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,460
are divided

245
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,750
to get a better way of representing

246
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,870
there are even different types of Tajima

247
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,790
under security changing your absolute

248
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,520
sure there are however when it comes to

249
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:54,140
creating the job semigraphics if you

250
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:57,980
will all the same choices and what these

251
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,480
people are doing just on different

252
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,050
applications or systems you'll see in

253
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:05,360
public business but may be scary to the

254
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,110
school getting out the community we're

255
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,460
going to figure out a way to graphically

256
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:14,480
do this with me when different pieces

257
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,330
they can go on after able to get this so

258
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,700
big for a staging anybody else question

259
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:24,200
up Thomas all right so let's get let's

260
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,590
get into how we all can help at home

261
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:31,130
changing sophistic hold in the community

262
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:34,000
because it's actually don't even include

263
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,660
the non-technical role so imagine how

264
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,420
many people were missing by not even

265
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,800
including them we can we feed all

266
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,720
because we are learning community and

267
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,130
businesses whether we like it or not

268
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:48,290
because we all come from research and

269
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,390
fires you like to solve problems and

270
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,760
this is a vast problem results the enemy

271
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,710
is still get came through this and not

272
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,540
what does complicated

273
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,070
I don't like it even written to video

274
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:02,210
you ever have a choice so we have to

275
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:05,240
recognize that you fail folks that most

276
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,510
of us some pepper in Jupiter are just as

277
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:11,260
important

278
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:14,150
use a scientist there in this room so

279
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,270
I'm not know the purpose even scarier to

280
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,520
think that all of our support in terms

281
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,950
of how we are a business on you continue

282
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:25,450
seeking there other than leadership so

283
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:29,330
we've got work to do I really believe is

284
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:31,160
all of us together are going to make

285
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,800
that change and the big way we're going

286
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,290
to save it is to use look at these tunes

287
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,330
lovely I'm going sitting right in front

288
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,940
of us on their technology thank you for

289
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:45,920
coming you're our future of stage in the

290
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,840
game and helping make sure that

291
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,280
everybody knows what's going on out

292
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:49,710
there

293
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:53,160
because right now this is how we this is

294
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,360
what's going on Oh guys we got one

295
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,530
stereotype of what it looks like to be a

296
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,810
tiger all over TV and honest-to-goodness

297
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,580
I have a whole talk about this tomorrow

298
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:08,120
it's just an every character out in the

299
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,460
Wilma TV and movies that represents our

300
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,760
community some formlessness look here on

301
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,270
the left side of the screen and while

302
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,830
this look is actually near and dear to

303
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,510
my heart because that was President

304
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:24,360
Marcos believe it or not I absolutely

305
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,630
did it course you can leave in retire I

306
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:29,460
desire a shaded HD moral comfortable

307
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:33,270
giving in an acquisition crisis graphic

308
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,400
7 and how I was feeling froggy what my

309
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,080
team was going to be like meeting this

310
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,140
community very well I have to take that

311
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:43,530
responsibility on and yet when I when I

312
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,240
would we look at each other we have

313
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,470
different look we're going to look

314
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:48,060
there's like five or six different looks

315
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,520
because we we all like different look so

316
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,680
the problem is is all we're selling this

317
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,010
mini blind or so myself to be impact

318
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:57,120
identified the in fact if I could

319
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,520
certainly not are anything I said oh if

320
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,510
I have it

321
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,640
others feel the same rules you can think

322
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,130
of how much we're missing in terms of

323
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:10,200
turning people on what I think about our

324
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,390
industry and how do we mean this to

325
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,550
maybe take those masses of information

326
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:17,160
like particularly remember when these

327
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,050
are the only stereotypes and role models

328
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:21,570
that they see it's not helping us so

329
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,700
we've got this problem they time on the

330
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,110
thinking of a legacy for an event and

331
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,550
then the other thing was I was explore

332
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:29,070
communication I mean I think that you

333
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:31,620
all think you really have to is what's

334
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,630
the hardest thing in your daily life

335
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:36,690
that work between technology and can we

336
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:41,970
gain a human you to human right any good

337
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:44,010
things that humans ought to do whatever

338
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:46,890
and show it to me - got it okay yeah I

339
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:49,820
mean really I want to all day long as

340
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,840
definitely afforded recruits they

341
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,030
developed an entry-level I've heard

342
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:56,170
reasons for reasoning my Empire

343
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:57,880
wife and one through my house today and

344
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,519
building software company the number one

345
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:04,920
reason for people leaving their job is

346
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:09,040
manager cultures what is it it's not

347
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,560
money it's not technology at times and

348
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,839
like some use doesn't mean that people

349
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,279
don't look for job because of those

350
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,490
things it means it's not the number one

351
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,800
reason for leaving so this board can be

352
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,050
making sentences here is causing a lot

353
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:24,670
of problems causing the problems

354
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:27,490
problems for men and not your role of

355
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,260
changing jobs every couple of years

356
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,970
which means you get very little

357
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:33,370
connection with other humans that's

358
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,649
powerful and long-lasting which is what

359
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:39,190
we all thrive on and with your knives

360
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:42,310
and if you are introverts you still

361
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:45,970
thrive on it we all do

362
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:50,920
and among example women my restaurant in

363
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,389
the red chair back there please get

364
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:54,510
there yes thank you for being together

365
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:58,089
this is women are leaving mid-career at

366
00:15:58,089 --> 00:16:00,790
53% leaving on community and you know

367
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,410
what we all need to say last because

368
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:05,350
they're raising kids and what starting

369
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,850
to come out now Carnegie Mellon's

370
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,649
through the lots of people through this

371
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:12,670
not that it's love it's being a minority

372
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,350
and having their own money very

373
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:19,620
protection pretty shitty are you

374
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,019
visiting and so the sort of places to go

375
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:26,500
I have health care the group's been

376
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,019
around longer an Apple regulation on how

377
00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:30,220
we all treat each other

378
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:33,220
wha actually compliance I see we mean

379
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,649
even to maintenance all the time and

380
00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:38,560
what city I think every man is here to

381
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,690
face much funner to work ribbon around

382
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:43,870
kind I know it was in both of us

383
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:47,589
the the is not much fun I get back to in

384
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:54,279
in some ways is the job you know what

385
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,800
I've heard a lot from issues and tears

386
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,459
in LA to not on how to include them

387
00:17:00,459 --> 00:17:02,410
makes it harder work over again

388
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:04,510
yes God and if we do

389
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:09,819
and fun of all things so uh nothing

390
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:13,359
beyond open for men and for women and it

391
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,190
was actually the walk home in these

392
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:17,890
people are unhappy where they work

393
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,480
because of how we have talked to each

394
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,430
other if they just talk that I give

395
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:23,260
called the five four three automatic

396
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,000
remote Cabul area David this week my

397
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,770
Sokka actually I'm gonna we're gonna go

398
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,540
through that one slide and I'm quickly

399
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:32,530
personal toxins uh in terms of the

400
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,570
important piece of skill so before we do

401
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:38,830
that complete any of you or parent you

402
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:41,290
got nieces that Matthews behind it gets

403
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:45,010
on to us it's like eliminated and please

404
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:47,380
this is juice the minute I saw my knees

405
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:50,560
very aroused using an image ten years

406
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,990
ago a design into the scarred me for

407
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:57,250
life is almost gone from playing so P

408
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:00,250
this isn't going to allow our women's

409
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,430
have penetrate the smartest job in the

410
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:05,950
country where you have to be test take

411
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,540
yourself very seriously and make sure

412
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,160
that under taking very seriously this is

413
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,900
not going to help them learn how to

414
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,400
penetrate battle it's going to help them

415
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,280
learn how to penetrate silences toys to

416
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,040
the right and so again we're going to

417
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,400
really do this together or any of the

418
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,970
reason that the security issues heinous

419
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,490
we've got essential issues in terms of

420
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:32,260
where we were long fostering are women

421
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:35,260
to be in the career so we are we going

422
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:38,320
to get the other image I am reading

423
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,030
together you can send it back for more

424
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:44,650
men over these index we started doing

425
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:47,350
two years ago and I'm not saying that a

426
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,300
real economy isn't it or anything I'm

427
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,980
saying it but your daughters are just

428
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:54,190
now graduating from colleges there is

429
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:57,250
Maurice but I'm opinion well then I

430
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,990
figure they're struggling and finding a

431
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:02,380
customer service job retail jobs and

432
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,510
they're going to Berkeley and they're

433
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,130
going to be schools and they're

434
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:08,290
struggling to find out why I started the

435
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:10,360
brain based platform will help young

436
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,750
girls and drove it into the field

437
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,340
it's the train their brains of nothing

438
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,410
to be looks like we've is extremely

439
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:21,820
and so we provide the b-team students to

440
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,860
work conferences instead of Lucca

441
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,390
different marketing doesn't have to call

442
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:28,810
a modeling agencies applause just

443
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,430
indicating a response that two months

444
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:32,410
ago I spare in the fans and rip up and

445
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:34,150
we're going to some cool stuff but the

446
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:39,190
reality is that we've got to recognize

447
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:43,030
that we can be right now strategically

448
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,950
making a list to make sure that our

449
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,200
women are your other included in career

450
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,820
so that we don't have to rely on

451
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:52,600
managing people across the ocean how

452
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,220
hard is it to manage and work together

453
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:58,050
in both they office so when we ask for

454
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:00,790
across the country conjugal visit all

455
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:04,750
doing it into this whorehouse internal

456
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,720
temp I got some set in DI outsourced to

457
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:11,520
Argentina and I don't want is terrible

458
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,350
it's terrible so how about the girls we

459
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,990
just train our girl here we're treating

460
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:19,660
when we go over there at you said hola

461
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,870
so that's bathtub my little speech I'm

462
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:27,610
will change this just something about

463
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:29,500
this all right some of the thoughts kill

464
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:34,450
thing if we just implement one thing it

465
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:37,330
will change literally the amount of

466
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:38,770
breakdown that happens in your

467
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:41,110
organization's every day and I really

468
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:43,570
challenge all of you to meet believe

469
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,160
having this guilty you don't have to

470
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,930
wait what people above and have it or

471
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:48,730
people deciding or below you can have it

472
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:51,130
yourself and this is idea of making

473
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:55,180
measurable agreements every time I see a

474
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,370
breakdown a breakdown these tell us

475
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:59,530
upset some feel they've been wrong

476
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:02,230
they're they're not happy with the

477
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:04,360
outcome and they believe basic their

478
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,580
roles in this interpretive that's right

479
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,890
down if there's an emotional negative

480
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:11,770
experience of people are upset and that

481
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,660
happens in the workplace a lot and why

482
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,880
does it happen if you guys knows what

483
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,210
was the trigger created that emotion

484
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,250
a person will start a sinking feeling

485
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,320
and perceiving negative emotions is

486
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,530
always because there is a miserable

487
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:28,020
reason somebody thought they were

488
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,910
supposed to do acts and somebody else

489
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,620
thought they were supposed to do why I

490
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,420
want to keep you down the delivery five

491
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,460
and whatever them is or is a process of

492
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,170
somebody there's has been work they're

493
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,360
not on the same page and there are fat

494
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,280
it's because there is no measurement

495
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,610
premiums and so this is something I

496
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:47,670
learned a pretty young in my career it

497
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:52,590
has been a failure of our organizations

498
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,750
is from a perspective of variable

499
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,390
breakdowns that we if we have an

500
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:59,310
interval agreement there is an emotional

501
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:01,380
upset because you know you're not going

502
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:05,130
to complete something for you you or you

503
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:06,690
know you will complete it there's no

504
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:08,880
gray you understand what needs to happen

505
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,610
and so does everybody else so when you

506
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:15,120
all think about your your current

507
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,510
workforce or where you work however both

508
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:20,340
there's everything that you're doing but

509
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,890
back there is a breakdown then DC

510
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:26,010
breakdown if it isn't possible that's

511
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,690
because there is a measurable agreement

512
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:29,520
I would better the lobbies they get that

513
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,920
I'd love to hear its buddies wants to

514
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,200
speak up right now and you can have a

515
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,490
great job recently you could say you

516
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:37,130
know what now that I think about it

517
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:39,390
somebody was thinking one thing and

518
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:41,490
another was thinking another who's I

519
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,680
guess certain issues at the highest

520
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:51,150
levels in the nation yesterday 3.3

521
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:53,640
million dollars of often productivity

522
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,480
watching the Comey try a little bit here

523
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,450
thank you you may be right we need it

524
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,490
even though any further just all around

525
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:05,730
up and it's hard it's really hard you

526
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:07,410
can see we're all imitators we're just

527
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:09,690
the innovation business we're all the

528
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:12,060
time to apply renewal obligation most of

529
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:15,510
us require we move move move but we her

530
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:18,210
the movement means not become have much

531
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:20,580
improvement it's really difficult

532
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,220
in fact when I think about it a lot

533
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,680
about this the military the problem is

534
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,490
that right everybody knows their job

535
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,920
everybody knows what the responsible

536
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,400
and we know in you know there's no lack

537
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,470
of transparency into the roles and

538
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:39,020
responsibilities and the other we ever

539
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,700
we think about in the government you

540
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,040
there's a big thing you're all you know

541
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,440
plan Maori bills that they are five for

542
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,030
two years if you want to look with other

543
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:49,340
job you can actually apply it you don't

544
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,960
have to hide under your desk talking to

545
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,500
a repeater or render your car because

546
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,510
you're allowed to move around within the

547
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:58,670
government industry sector but in

548
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:01,070
corporate that doesn't happen and so

549
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:03,080
here we all are running running running

550
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:07,669
one is on the line and a measurable

551
00:24:07,669 --> 00:24:09,220
reason for the last thing we think

552
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,990
because when we make them we have a slow

553
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:14,510
dad we have to really plan everything

554
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:16,880
out we have to totally understand the

555
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,270
ended and that's work that we're not

556
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:23,630
used to doing and so I I love keeping

557
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,880
the course it's really important it's

558
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,900
also a live report online and as because

559
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,820
you know there's making several rivers

560
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,350
and then there's going back to work

561
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:35,419
after we make them finding out that oh

562
00:24:35,419 --> 00:24:37,610
I'm not going to be doing it that way or

563
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:38,929
it's not going to be that classroom so

564
00:24:38,929 --> 00:24:40,820
they're managing them too because it

565
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,080
doesn't just say it because it's

566
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,110
measurable go step is done as a whole or

567
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,760
concept of having make initial

568
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,100
agreements and manage them in every day

569
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:53,150
it works if up and I went back so that's

570
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:55,280
used for me and then the Queen language

571
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:59,929
is words words words we use being

572
00:24:59,929 --> 00:25:02,870
thoughtful of them so that we go for

573
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:05,240
people's death so that we meant the

574
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,760
critical measurement opportunities who

575
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,850
could be making and I'm so choosing our

576
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:13,070
words and our language is such a

577
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:15,200
critical critical piece of what we're

578
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,770
all doing out here and it says on that

579
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:20,750
note let's have a little bit of fun here

580
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,790
and how are you doing on time in the

581
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:27,140
press oh that's my truth I thought is

582
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:32,840
are me time okay so this is these are

583
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:36,770
the five work then I say if you will

584
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:38,950
eliminate from your vocabulary who

585
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:40,760
admittedly lower

586
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,240
breakdown

587
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,330
organization these were our emotionally

588
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:51,730
charging or these abilities of action so

589
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:52,539
let's have some fun

590
00:25:52,539 --> 00:25:54,309
I usually have my pictures of all these

591
00:25:54,309 --> 00:25:57,850
they don't have them right now let's

592
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:01,780
start let's start with try try I don't

593
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,429
have a pen on me but usually like just

594
00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:05,020
come down there I'll review all if I

595
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:07,510
drop it on the floor and I think pick up

596
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:11,789
that you get the pin 4 meter booster

597
00:26:11,789 --> 00:26:14,130
something somehow I guess what they did

598
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:15,580
yesterday

599
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:19,080
I think of the bad there people prepare

600
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,700
so I'm gonna picking up apparently

601
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,490
trying to think up some that I'm picking

602
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:28,299
up because the water try actually is

603
00:26:28,299 --> 00:26:30,970
modern action and yet he was not here

604
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:33,070
every day at work I want to try and do

605
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,990
that yeah I'm gonna try that I'll try

606
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:37,150
that I'm going to try and make that done

607
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:39,070
tonight when I'm going those are words

608
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:42,250
dry I am my full body wakes up I'm in a

609
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:42,610
meeting

610
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:44,409
okay this isn't retire are we doing

611
00:26:44,409 --> 00:26:47,080
right or seconds there's nothing there's

612
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:47,919
a lack of clarity

613
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,530
somebody doesn't really know what the

614
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:53,110
act is or they're not engaging and

615
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,669
they're just going to blow it off that

616
00:26:54,669 --> 00:26:57,400
person coming tomorrow be like hey did

617
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,929
your busyness classify on your good

618
00:26:58,929 --> 00:27:00,520
night and that doesn't try and do unless

619
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,409
I'm is get to it now I'm going to break

620
00:27:02,409 --> 00:27:02,830
it

621
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:06,700
people want to do this you know wasn't

622
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:10,210
calling uh I don't I like to move off of

623
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:13,510
that so it's eliminating them or a try

624
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:17,710
it look like this I asked as you cannot

625
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:21,820
get that bump or yes I will absolutely

626
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,309
have that bus tonight it's one of the

627
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,900
good and if you're not hearing that

628
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,179
you're hearing try you as an individual

629
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:29,500
living here in the leader controller hop

630
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,049
you need to engage figure it out and

631
00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:33,340
figure out what are we talking about

632
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:35,350
community how do we make sure that

633
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:37,570
they're not a breakdown so watch this

634
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:39,340
word and maybe even have a little

635
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,130
experiment out of it and excited

636
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:44,760
meeting don't stop it penny how familiar

637
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:48,660
is and what what happens is over the

638
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,150
next days a week by reading this word in

639
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:54,840
in the office okay

640
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,480
just an interesting one there's what

641
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,790
there's a few areas where student

642
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:02,010
athlete needs to be used in the word not

643
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:03,600
as when we're in a state of infinite

644
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,870
response or word this data you must do

645
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:09,660
this cash right now I'm telling you

646
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:12,360
because we need to get it done and you

647
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:17,490
should do this to the works anything is

648
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:19,650
emergency when your body I'm letting it

649
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:21,390
go Katie needs the works just otherwise

650
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:23,700
what do we go before you remember Jim

651
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,440
Webb's and when we use the word

652
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:31,340
generating ideas ah me should it's

653
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:34,380
believing meaning I'm telling you what

654
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,720
to do receipt allowing you to think

655
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,900
about your options think about what what

656
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,670
you think is the best way to do

657
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:44,700
something and as a leader or TV the most

658
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,650
important thing we beat we can do for

659
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:48,570
each other is why we also be beverage

660
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:50,790
need to hear how other people think

661
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:52,980
because it is through hearing how other

662
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,350
people think that we actually get a 302

663
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:58,590
to get review on situations and so

664
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:00,930
whatever we say should you should do

665
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:02,520
this you should do that we're

666
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,880
eliminating our bill until you hear what

667
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,610
the person would do if they for guidance

668
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:10,920
you really want to look for the leader

669
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,720
of those differences some existing

670
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,570
something it's pretty rare that somebody

671
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:17,850
just speak up that and their goodness

672
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:19,980
you can do that or they're going to defy

673
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,510
and then you're gonna and all we have

674
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:25,800
right now this happens is so this words

675
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,600
a break myself a minute

676
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,690
fine fine fine fine how would it have a

677
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:33,120
fine work in your in your workforce you

678
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,330
figure it fine up by what is it what is

679
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:39,690
it say vc-1 engaged does it make you to

680
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:43,350
want to talk about rhythm just misses

681
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:45,390
it's totally dismissive because I'm not

682
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:48,270
interested you don't really care or I

683
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:51,090
don't I'm not disease issues whatever it

684
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:52,990
is you have to get rid of

685
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:55,870
because we either turn each other on or

686
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:58,780
off all day long period across the words

687
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:01,270
that come out of our mouth and if this

688
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:02,890
isn't the place we're going to have the

689
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:04,600
American dream I don't know where it's

690
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,120
going to be I refuse to work around

691
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,250
anything else as a positive L faint

692
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:10,870
behavior and yet we're still highly

693
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:13,390
selective thinking on serious challenges

694
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:15,730
and that means you gotta come with

695
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:18,070
language you got to come with skills and

696
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,840
it isn't just tech skill it's also

697
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,450
doodling to communicate the way that

698
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:25,059
makes people more on than off in that

699
00:30:25,059 --> 00:30:27,670
autumn everywhere why not why not

700
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:31,720
so it's fine what I was fairly young in

701
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,090
school is the essence of what we almost

702
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:39,820
be incapable of normal emotions yeah the

703
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:43,059
point for that is to say that normal is

704
00:30:43,059 --> 00:30:47,440
to be upbeat and for whatever reason

705
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,870
we're all going to non-normal by many

706
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:53,590
humans in general are not you know down

707
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:56,770
or or unofficial or what-have-you and

708
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:59,230
this is it doesn't need to be that our

709
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:01,510
environment or like that all right so

710
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:03,370
how about awesome seems pretty easy my

711
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:04,870
honour will not involve or when I'm in a

712
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:06,429
meeting I'm rare the word obviously

713
00:31:06,429 --> 00:31:08,350
actually meet in some occur I gotta get

714
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:11,200
my ice creams and obviously some good

715
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,510
work we can get it in talking about why

716
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:16,090
would they say that they want to stop

717
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:18,190
the conversation you know what happens

718
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,800
the minute son drinkin forward obviously

719
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,690
because your honor how to do what very

720
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:24,670
very card of the beer is supposed to be

721
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:27,250
smarter they are telling us before I'm a

722
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,740
collusive remember the stuff it's an

723
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,630
emotionally-charged a water go ahead and

724
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:35,410
healthy five words are really easy to

725
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:38,980
eliminate from our vocabulary right it's

726
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,510
not going to harm us it's actually going

727
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:43,030
to really help us close anything worth

728
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:45,670
anybody wants usually after this meeting

729

hear the stories what happens when you

777
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,460
start focusing on these five words in

778
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,770
your home vocabulary and eliminating

779
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:57,660
them and what it does for you but also

780
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:00,690
is watching these words we use around

781
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:02,490
you and what happened what's happening

782
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:04,530
when they're being used and really

783
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:06,840
taking your social science you're a

with I want to leave you with these

794
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,820
three these three bullet points to solve

795
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,859
which is we've got an incredibly diverse

796
00:34:31,859 --> 00:34:33,659
workforce we need to spread the words of

797
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:35,280
all the different types of jobs and not

798
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,690
just make things about hacking and

799
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:40,619
skillful on the skill of package we need

800
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:42,869
to understand there's a lot of cross

801
00:34:42,869 --> 00:34:44,820
training going on how many engineers it

802
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,820
becomes build in just the last year

803
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:50,280
accrued of tunnel it is more places that

804
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,379
we're seeing that and then last but not

805
00:34:52,379 --> 00:34:53,040
least

806
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,129
spreading the word on effective 50%

807
00:34:56,129 --> 00:34:59,220
higher paying buzz lot of great travel

808
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,260
you have to be conferences put it out

809
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,060
there getting out there to the success

810
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:08,030
of both young and older and then this I

811
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:10,140
want to leave you with this picture

812
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,550
which is back

813
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:14,369
my whole career has been working for men

814
00:35:14,369 --> 00:35:16,980
and I'm good also have never been here

815
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:19,470
so I love men the world clear this is

816
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:21,270
not about men are the problem

817
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:24,000
ridiculously even say that devalue the

818
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,910
solutions we need you understand what it

819
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:31,040
is to be the one woman that's around and

820
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,510
meaning think about that woman and help

821
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:35,340
back on them and reprogramming your

822
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,560
companies that make it fit that we could

823
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,140
have women stick around subscribe we

824
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,570
need some we're not going to make a

825
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:44,369
while wrap on that you already discussed

826
00:35:44,369 --> 00:35:46,140
that earlier and I'll leave you with

827
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:49,920
this component is what if it was the

828
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,600
other way around now here's a little

829
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,800
screwed up think about this play there

830
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,530
are no pictures of a bunch of women

831
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:05,520
consume it exists I mean major its

832
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,310
active is crazy my market acceptance is

833
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:10,680
on top of our day here in hospital so

834
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,640
maybe be able Esther how abacus

835
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,470
easily didn't have will get I'm sure

836
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:20,569
another change so how crazy is that

837
00:36:20,569 --> 00:36:23,539
Oh God so this is the only future maybe

838
00:36:23,539 --> 00:36:26,359
right at the role reverse it hasn't

839
00:36:26,359 --> 00:36:27,949
passes we'll help each other out that

840
00:36:27,949 --> 00:36:30,439
retire more women trained more with us

841
00:36:30,439 --> 00:36:33,769
and then however let's uh let's not sure

842
00:36:33,769 --> 00:36:36,949
what it's like to be I have a picture

843
00:36:36,949 --> 00:36:39,709
and women in suits the big innovation

844
00:36:39,709 --> 00:36:41,359
they need to wear I've got a whole

845
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:44,089
conversation level marriage it okay for

846
00:36:44,089 --> 00:36:46,369
another day like we've got a lot of

847
00:36:46,369 --> 00:36:48,439
stuff all that messy so we're running

848
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:49,009
out of time

849
00:36:49,009 --> 00:37:05,869
but questions from anybody yes careers

850
00:37:05,869 --> 00:37:08,450
are very different

851
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:11,649
[Music]

852
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:19,319
[Music]

853
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:43,330
so they always create all that great I

854
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:46,780
love that question it's absolutely awful

855
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:49,060
job searching in cyber because there's a

856
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,950
lot of problems leaders and also because

857
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:53,440
a lot of editing that hiring members are

858
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,000
trying to get more in one and

859
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,680
unfortunately what's happening entire

860
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,180
advantages are cutting and piecing their

861
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:01,930
job or meaning we just the research self

862
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:04,180
and for security engineer let's go look

863
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,310
at all doctor clips and see what people

864
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:08,830
tell people post what words are they

865
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:10,510
using and don't we found some of there's

866
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:13,510
three different job everybody person to

867
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:16,660
please that's great what was what you

868
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,400
need is a networking here telling you

869
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,800
what other company needs and so we have

870
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,480
probably their problem that is what my

871
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,930
research even further that's evolving

872
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:27,490
our product is being used internally

873
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:29,710
we're going to go live businesses we

874
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,420
have a kid no more cutting and pasting

875
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,820
actually have a tool product and walks

876
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,170
you through the process and what is the

877
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:37,630
person going to different verses what do

878
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,700
you think they need to have a skill set

879
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,920
that's what we're missing when is the

880
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,230
top one of the tap and the project that

881
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:46,960
this person has to do every day and

882
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,570
making the hiring is are sit down and

883
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:51,010
then you can figure that out because

884
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:53,920
that's what we knew by being excused

885
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,560
when we take off staffing for coming

886
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,420
filling a job that's the first thing

887
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,890
you're going to do now that I've chosen

888
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:01,630
for what hours we don't get access to

889
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,250
that person to have that our

890
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:05,050
conversation just about that top ground

891
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:07,150
and a lot of tenses up because what's

892
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:08,620
going to happen is we're all gonna we're

893
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:10,540
all going to just dance around this is

894
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:11,860
the wrong person this is the wrong

895
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,990
person until that I review sits down and

896
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:16,120
here's the past and the project seven

897
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,500
seven three months six months nine

898
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,120
months a year which is the medical

899
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,180
agreements the slowing down right so

900
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:24,250
that's that's a lot of it's all

901
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:26,740
completed but also just learn super job

902
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,600
everybody feel like there are jobs out

903
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,460
there right when you're searching is

904
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,660
still awful you're talking to all these

905
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,080
people

906
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,850
the number one thing in common language

907
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:36,310
city gas actually aging in government

908
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:43,300
yes well that's a blind aggression to

909
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:54,010
Pericles death might have the among the

910
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:55,600
empty level problems in touch more

911
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,310
severe the problem with mister level if

912
00:39:57,310 --> 00:40:00,220
somebody wants to train so the only one

913
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,960
got school having experience in security

914
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,390
operation stuff where we're rare they

915
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:07,900
can experience those I this is something

916
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,970
a trying to conceive on connection which

917
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:11,380
is getting our scheme students to run

918
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,300
our conventions the basis of a

919
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,920
sensitivity relationship sites that

920
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,140
people will be more willing to take some

921
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:19,060
time on really needs people's purses

922
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,650
look at a resume or a depressing that

923

well they generally be safe cause it's

973
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,800
been a better the how it's going to go

974
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,360
if you all know the mountain to discover

975
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,010
to feel air and ourselves living on top

976
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:32,720
of what people pay at all which means

977
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,270
starting right here nobody gets to ask

978
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:37,610
the question what are you thinking I

979
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:39,020
don't know how it's gonna work

980
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,970
I'm severe down my mind in terms of

981
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:42,980
library training everybody at public

982
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:45,320
suppose community because we can't come

983
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,970
together and hire now we're going out

984
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:48,440
this is a difference it comes from a
