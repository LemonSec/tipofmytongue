1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,500
the change at the army barber to

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,710
exchange decision friend appearing at

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,880
West Point our thing else they would

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,070
okay very good

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:23,330
is Michael hunter configure pushing

6
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,980
again I am working at the arm snipers

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,039
shoot which is okay at what Camille and

8
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:30,510
Kyle at my talk here is picking about

9
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,140
inside the box its wait for oxidation

10
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,390
renovation and enough to hit the

11
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,250
Allstate Tyler I didn't think we gave

12
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,020
the second step of your topic may

13
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,270
looking for vegetable aisle so that's

14
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,930
that it is a little while now at the

15
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,590
morning tiger Institute's

16
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:59,250
what we do is communication together we

17
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,399
can serve so depiction or cyber defense

18
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,709
cyber offense focus on offense community

19
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:08,869
open on cyber defense and what they

20
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:18,890
dispute and a very inspirational

21
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:45,400
like my my team hold up ah obvious

22
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,390
what's the next one I think I skip my

23
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,740
building video first that shows a little

24
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:54,660
with or

25
00:02:29,989 --> 00:02:39,480
now this update to the other to get

26
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:57,470
thanks mom that is the wrong joke there

27
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:08,420
with eight of them actually like

28
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:14,940
which McNamee arms anymore but you can

29
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:24,419
put your minor but it really Rajiv you

30
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:32,099
are it change the question late and then

31
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:38,550
use the leg of good yoga tomorrow so

32
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,169
really we're talking about is that

33
00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:42,090
doctor hardest address being a little

34
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,340
button we'll really if it's trying to

35
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:48,840
figure out not to these forms when

36
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,039
they're not trying some people will

37
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,520
taking about really audible intensity

38
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,990
there is a belief that variation so

39
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:58,440
security expert you know what music is

40
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,570
on there let me see if this works

41
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:03,320
one more time

42
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,460
opportunity continue around resources we

43
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:27,299
have it works

44
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:38,589
yeah our activity so I'm so really here

45
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:41,149
this is really our mission from Audrey

46
00:05:41,149 --> 00:05:43,129
developing our fire suits 35 years ago

47
00:05:43,129 --> 00:05:46,490
on 2012 on VPN service for a start-up

48
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:48,439
orientation I was just talking total

49
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:50,719
knee replacement is millions on we

50
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,819
reside in an old woman former story

51
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:55,580
right outside he was on campus so we

52
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,009
have my children is our eighth audience

53
00:05:58,009 --> 00:06:00,349
yeah I'm here to focus over your sternum

54
00:06:00,349 --> 00:06:02,029
and so long

55
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,490
what I find is what we really do two

56
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,439
things now in fact partnerships can

57
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:08,930
build an electric app of our new me

58
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,369
director you saw it in the video for

59
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:12,949
Andy all on you tip over last year and

60
00:06:12,949 --> 00:06:16,580
the sort of proposed a new machine and

61
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,669
I've seen this intermission it's

62
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,899
confusing on the producer slander

63
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:22,999
another the introduce Larry research

64
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:24,769
from seeking future thoughts and

65
00:06:24,769 --> 00:06:27,199
developing innovation we innovate such

66
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,589
as innovation from invasion on too

67
00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:33,409
generous to kernels to other services

68
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:36,589
for our nation defense or cyber

69
00:06:36,589 --> 00:06:38,599
resilience and so what I thought about

70
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:41,180
oil in this notion of constructive

71
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,330
island expects like the infant ear the

72
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:46,879
API first toy figure is comfortable

73
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:49,459
cyber tops and this is a promotional

74
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:53,360
item is she - Part III here cyber talks

75
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,389
give voice to disruptive hibernation so

76
00:06:56,389 --> 00:06:58,099
I kept asking like um I was attending

77
00:06:58,099 --> 00:07:00,709
these offices what is disruptive cyber

78
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:01,279
division

79
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:04,159
I didn't idea what it is I'm not sure

80
00:07:04,159 --> 00:07:07,309
that that's what we're doing and then

81
00:07:07,309 --> 00:07:09,649
one column disruptive innovation

82
00:07:09,649 --> 00:07:12,229
distinguishes itself for my celebrated

83
00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:14,959
group into mental image this is a bit

84
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:17,149
and talk about thinking inside the boss

85
00:07:17,149 --> 00:07:19,309
is bridging the office awesome

86
00:07:19,309 --> 00:07:21,289
innovation engine separate quadrants

87
00:07:21,289 --> 00:07:26,599
now if you're a business major as anyone

88
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:29,119
MGH in here if you're in this video

89
00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:30,740
we've already seen a couple to four

90
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,249
letters today

91
00:07:31,249 --> 00:07:33,619
written down the relevance into four

92
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:36,050
quadrants are under the matrix where an

93
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,389
improving innovations answered love or

94
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:41,269
complexity in solution and a targeted

95
00:07:41,269 --> 00:07:44,749
market and so if we're looking at most

96
00:07:44,749 --> 00:07:45,470
as well

97
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:47,450
complexity and existing markets I'm

98
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:50,180
considering X 18 visions and those are

99
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,490
such reservations big computer models on

100
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,980
the in current needs actually do a lot

101
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,050
of group or disruptive innovations

102
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,700
because it in the marketplace

103
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,400
on the finer size complexity though it's

104
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,840
still hard in existing markets

105
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,120
I call it incremental image or

106
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,100
evolutionary time supervision you're

107
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,490
competing with your ear pure or direct

108
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,620
or you're a person's or you can edit

109
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,130
errs on your get I'm hearing I'm doing a

110
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:17,960
lot of artisans in the military sort of

111
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,090
argued with that on primarily doing this

112
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:22,280
on military audiences I'm convinced

113
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,320
denim whose brain repair now

114
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,300
breakthrough innovation I call jumping

115
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:26,780
occur

116
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,900
I'm tied and flexing many markets we

117
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,110
earn from lessons eight bucks and what I

118
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,610
do is noticing lines constructed

119
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,710
efficient run your scenarios we've are a

120
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:40,549
lot of on this entire in Naturalizer

121
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:42,650
movie bottom between perhaps or

122
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:45,410
activate or cyber crackers era giving a

123
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,060
lot of disruptive innovation I try to

124
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,030
get how we pet against its converting a

125
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,430
number popular possibly the biggest is

126
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:55,130
cheap a simplistic attacks that are

127
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:59,330
going on partners now I told you about

128
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,430
the Occupy on top of means the other

129
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,930
fruit or vegetables so this can be

130
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:05,540
almost like a capsule again this morning

131
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,610
smart and fifth beta show hands now

132
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,010
audience participation who thinks a

133
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:11,630
tomato is a fruit

134
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:15,140
two pairs can be all right chef and she

135
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:18,680
thinks it's hammer the vegetable we have

136
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,970
a field okay

137
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:23,390
back um potent as well even though like

138
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,280
maybe for fish I've ever spoken

139
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,570
consuming vegetables but right we can we

140
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,360
quantify these are various dishes

141
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,430
between partial plan is that helps us

142
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:37,810
out if you watched the Martian

143
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,550
you'd be immodest I mean any firing

144
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,210
logic

145
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:44,690
after watching the Martian I mean and

146
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,940
then we think to do this much so if

147
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,800
you're it you're correct

148
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,560
up some to work now

149
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:56,190
if you multiple generator and tomato I

150
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:59,400
wonder why it is right shutter speeds

151
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:04,470
for petrol by smoke again a little bit

152
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:09,180
more connection and so the reason why I

153
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,810
do this now is when I look at these

154
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,760
deported and projects the way I think

155
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,490
about it is I'm thinking with sustaining

156
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,980
innovations as either I thought these

157
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,620
folks with the Star Trek t-shirt I'm not

158
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,720
sure if they're still here but the right

159
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,430
if you think watch spot she's watchful

160
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,590
person and you can get Captain Kirk in

161
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:33,360
most high leaves published success rates

162
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,880
that's a recognition someone want people

163
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,100
persist any engages like very logical

164
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:43,020
very organized very compassion but it's

165
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:46,500
based on numbers on incremental fine I'm

166
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,240
thinking anyone has I read that magazine

167
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,140
your kids weapons five versus five

168
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,520
actually what think about it all you're

169
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,900
doing is trying to one-up your

170
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,960
competitor absurd so you're going about

171
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,810
communication time kill each other so

172
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:01,770
not a good idea

173
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,990
present innovations I'm thinking of

174
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,750
James Bond and if you think much in fun

175
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,960
but all the resources of cute format for

176
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,390
all of them I pondered all the my six

177
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:15,480
believe all the British wealth is made

178
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,540
into building his gas saving day we're

179
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,520
not just from what's my example is

180
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:25,520
disruptive I'm dating myself here again

181
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,710
I'm thinking with on right the circle is

182
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:31,110
my lucky seeing the world with whatever

183
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:34,740
is at his disposal right cheesy got ten

184
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:39,960
grand to keep our hammers nails where is

185
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,030
in the vicinity

186
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,800
now if actually none of the divider is

187
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,140
now there is a reason right I mean I

188
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,980
haven't seen a different Club I can't

189
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,710
the person look I thought two charters

190
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,780
fondly undercover

191
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,360
and can help to describe I think it

192
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,540
gives you more missing border he does

193
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,150
look at disposal I'm just driving the

194
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,910
old engine through so many truth on the

195
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:08,300
round town is using sticks to be people

196
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:12,600
but I told you to again put this Creek

197
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,490
again we'll put a little more money out

198
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:16,020
of military clogging sponsors so there's

199
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,990
one character here or one right one

200
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:22,920
pictures it out it doesn't fit that's

201
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,000
really all right

202
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,220
I don't have any 500 but the runners

203
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,920
spot right better any more cheese plate

204
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,340
one just firestar Jackie played in a TV

205
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:35,460
show called Mission Possible and he

206
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:38,040
played first Paris wasn't have to decide

207
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,380
right you can speak any mindedness and

208
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,450
Colin any anyone thinking through they

209
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:47,220
are some general some law or nation and

210
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,140
really say hey if you're trying to clone

211
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,970
someone you didn't focus that we grow

212
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,250
there are five characters on missions

213
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:56,730
often contain they are really affecting

214
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:00,240
their they're still crap into funny doc

215
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,990
you'll find on other receivers or a lot

216
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:04,530
as well

217
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:11,010
preserves now again I'm not a big fan of

218
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,570
these partners where they will get these

219
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:13,920
quadrants aren't you always break the

220
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,050
wall down these little quadrants but

221
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:18,150
underneath one you I don't have on my

222
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,260
scale they don't have numbers

223
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:25,440
Oh hold on we just need words and it's

224
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,760
really for most perspective I guess

225
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,680
here's my military back my military

226
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,480
analogous to destroy them sustaining

227
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,350
innovations is the m16 again be sneaking

228
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:37,320
off in Burnaby another one that came up

229
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,780
with the m62 in 1683

230
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,790
I just different variable to improve

231
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:44,790
with akshay kumar's are to improve

232
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,900
safety for those users and then include

233
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,130
language in right now we're using em for

234
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,410
lighter weight systems let's notice

235
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:54,750
stating there's a good loss you smart

236
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,450
improve it so that a given user under

237
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:03,530
functions or instrumental I'm thinking

238
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:06,990
in your rental app you can check the

public's right that's a lot of time what

272
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:39,050
about this funny to be this is us have a

273
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:40,670
history of disruptive in issues in the

of our formation the American Revolution

276
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:51,350
increased every war right we're fighting

277
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,230
a bridge through the regulars right

278
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:55,100
Mayweather the regular order they were

279
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,579
trained a professional military army

280
00:15:57,579 --> 00:16:00,860
George Washington had business that's

281
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,600
aboard Washington and so this is what

282
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,610
people of disruptive revolutionary types

283
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:07,160
of innovation where different members

am are so natural crispy weekend

286
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,920
thinking well I guess you do have to

287
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,350
stay here we can have a mystery right

288
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,809
destructive finish back in World War two

289
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:20,040
um

290
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,779
notion of time we protect our shipping

291
00:16:23,779 --> 00:16:27,480
what was the big threat in war - Oh

292
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,120
Marie not you won't back to the sunroom

293
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,899
a in a live access into the British when

294
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:36,089
we start supply aggression our allies

295
00:16:36,089 --> 00:16:38,190
with a lot of material and then they

296
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:41,279
turn on soldiers at the budget who were

297
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,259
right at least one big reason sneaking

298
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:47,160
Lusitania how do we stop these German

299
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,459
submarines well they're dealing with one

300
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:52,170
and then there was one where we can't

301
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:55,380
recognition over the remember which was

302
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:58,079
an addition game or a sir and a spring

303
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,779

304
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:02,639
computer out door and I was breaking

305
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,650
right now blanket computer crimes

306
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,169
unbreakable folders but what they

307
00:17:07,169 --> 00:17:09,569
wouldn't ask you we can be developers

308
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:12,270
they called operations research will be

309
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,640
hibbity it thought scientists

310
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,619
interviewed they gave it all this data

311
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:19,770
on shoot why this should send a adjourn

312
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:23,510
should I got some she's not back right

313
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,520
example that back then or basic urges

314
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,890
that petition figure out if you put a

315
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:32,460
convoy of ships to a more ships into a

316
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,460
bottom or your bubble is your life

317
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:38,309
increases dramatically it was until

318
00:17:38,309 --> 00:17:39,510
after where we've started happening

319
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,460
these German people commander we figure

320
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,200
out that whether it was just a sensible

321
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,240
now firstly this if it's just a moment

322
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,700
it's your war when once I sort of

323
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,440
cackling these German u-boat commanders

324
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,750
I get interesting on higher you can you

325
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,210
won 7-1 we've seen gospel you see them

326
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:57,510
it sucks to be in a diesel powered

327
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,820
submarine in today's your need to talk

328
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,370
separatists their X there is not any a

329
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:07,380
native them also good oh yeah it's best

330
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,620
interests of the patient it's bad bad GG

331
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,650
is best respond so you know commanders

332
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:16,290
they never wanted a cap if the head

333
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,630
chest beats once it was for that there

334
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,400
are further consideration lists their

335
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,100
own tribal so if they spot us sure more

336
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,710
ships it would be done them and they may

337
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,630
be they big children the ownership of

338
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:29,360
really their location we

339
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,059
aircraft home in there that's uh people

340
00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:33,260
commanders consumers

341
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,900
so again Burke operations research map

342
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:40,750
battle to piece solve this international

343
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:44,840
drug and UAVs that's the struggle

344
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,940
especially to are any other protein

345
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,490
climates and I'd love to make on the Air

346
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:52,610
Force here in the Air Force if I have a

347
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,950
kind of it look a more subtle the Air

348
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:57,350
Force are maybe there this is the Army's

349
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,809
person you can keep income small rocky

350
00:18:59,809 --> 00:19:02,660
through the truck off the shelf degrees

351
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:05,000
now the average is the UAV is humongous

352
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,669
are doing being a Global Hawk that's the

353
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:09,890
Air Force's partition anyways maybe it

354
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:12,980
is unmanned but it is huge it's large an

355
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:16,790
assessment and if used for excuse my

356
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:19,010
apart under students - well that's

357
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:22,490
that's the reversion disruptive I still

358
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:25,160
call that breaker okay look at Air Force

359
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,140
give me that I didn't read it or trying

360
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:32,419
to get my direction I put your engine

361
00:19:32,419 --> 00:19:34,790
able to sorry I do not like this motion

362
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:37,220
about not having space a little bit

363
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:40,100
better so it's going back to my head and

364
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,049
I'm going to add one more quadrant here

365
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:44,120
and if you ask that water this really

366
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,549
doesn't or one more axis its photos of

367
00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:48,440
office you really only think like once I

368
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,260
just acquired if I added

369
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,590
motion of offset potential right the

370
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:56,870
offset traction this notion of a compact

371
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,700
when what are the innovations of you

372
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,040
tiny welcome to Destructoid transition

373
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,530
so when you review your business books

374
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:05,320
at talk about take more risks in

375
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,090
diminishes they're not talking about any

376
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:10,640
implementation and then time off is

377
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,820
dropping recommendations if your

378
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:16,040
different part of the pain and if your

379
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,010
elongation this is what we really need

380
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,770
is really when she receiving awesome

381
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:24,730
about changing office potentially out to

382
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:27,740
positive exactly if others that's right

383
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,870
at the office so staying in general

384
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,540
innovations that favorable we initiated

385
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:37,720
a lotta sense I'm taking a work with 89%

386
00:20:38,009 --> 00:20:40,149
however instructor breaker

387
00:20:40,149 --> 00:20:43,629
what are for the on chair any ideas what

388
00:20:43,629 --> 00:20:47,679
we 5% here from fighting and multiplier

389
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,889
and even auctioneer platinum and ten

390
00:20:50,889 --> 00:20:53,289
percent less than one member of eleven

391
00:20:53,289 --> 00:20:54,519
one we're going to Austin traction

392
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:57,609
that's the one a ten percent okay I'll

393
00:20:57,609 --> 00:20:59,590
give you what my thoughts are is again

394
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:02,679
from uh it's mark exactly wonderful to

395
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:05,259
get I don't get is a pretty good against

396
00:21:05,259 --> 00:21:07,359
not a whole lot of sense again these are

397
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:09,249
the ice crystal I'll be taking if you

398
00:21:09,249 --> 00:21:11,109
really want to be tuned to innovation

399
00:21:11,109 --> 00:21:13,659
introspective great and again this is

400
00:21:13,659 --> 00:21:16,239
what the graph would look like and fill

401
00:21:16,239 --> 00:21:20,100
without numbers or more representative

402
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:25,119
I'm going to go back to 2010 2011 Arab

403
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:29,590
revolts we had full of 40 nations their

404
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,869
homes after the event Manhattan tunisia

405
00:21:31,869 --> 00:21:36,100
like that it was the street vendor who

406
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,529
sent out the fire not because you want

407
00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:40,389
to addiction office people resellers

408
00:21:40,389 --> 00:21:43,149
it's right to the police center places

409
00:21:43,149 --> 00:21:45,309
all that military person on the Sheikh

410
00:21:45,309 --> 00:21:49,659
Said martyr all this eruption like 40

411
00:21:49,659 --> 00:21:53,739
nations all one whose improvement yes

412
00:21:53,739 --> 00:21:56,080
you might say that a lot of pestilence

413
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:01,450
social media management word that a lot

414
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:10,090
of s uplands 40 nations we

415
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:15,129
had a total of four that successfully we

416
00:22:15,129 --> 00:22:17,769
will actually changing government

417
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:22,389
immediately so right 4014 I'm going to

418
00:22:22,389 --> 00:22:25,389
get up to see it will change well I'm

419
00:22:25,389 --> 00:22:26,340
not coming

420
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,450
we're stretching we're not hunting the

421
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,159
air I'm not I'm Syria right there's look

422
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,730
like a finished pasture it's not looking

423
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:40,330
good in Egypt it was motoring exact

424
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:43,539
different I have to know Turk you say in

425
00:22:43,539 --> 00:22:45,879
your book because what the military has

426
00:22:45,879 --> 00:22:48,680
to see if not better capable

427
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:52,130
like they all the guns and as a member

428
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:55,280
of effect right I'm glad there's a

429
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,040
reason why our Congress keeps meeting me

430
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,130
around every three meters it's not to

431
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,590
make life miserable commute our honors

432
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:06,680
is not like anyone that as royalties

433
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,960
torille Genesis the moves are out and do

434
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,760
lots of things to make life difficult

435
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,970
we're military shotgun on the twenty

436
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:16,280
years up in military I have moved 11

437
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,570
times okay I got over that three-year

438
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:23,150
average personal locations about every

439
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:23,860
two years

440
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,540
not only that any of our leaders right

441
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:29,180
here a transitional to only tears so I'm

442
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,680
going to an art events got into a Deepak

443
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,480
life Narcisa that relate to only

444
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,520
eighteen months our leaders only play

445
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,330
screeching our citizen history one year

446
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:41,240
but Walter a lot of systemic

447
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:45,520
haters booth together but undernutrition

448
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,190
complain I asked but as all the other

449
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:51,260
has the u.s. institution there's a

450
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,420
reason that we have like this won't

451
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:56,000
reduce our back we see a lot of South

452
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,790
America Southeast Asia militaries are

453
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,380
back that's why you want to keep control

454
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:03,020
of the military if you're gonna if

455
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,840
they're the one their immediate people

456
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:09,830
so this case to read out of 14 yeah well

457
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:11,920
in this case it was about 21 percent

458
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,540
okay I just don't like numbers other

459
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,700
program anywhere less than one percent

460
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,400
on to tempers that's really rising in

461
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,260
this case on his local Tampa the only

462
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,180
one percent success rate

463
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:32,570
we're military machine so really now

464
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:34,190
really really what highlighted I can

465
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:37,220
talk the number of clients and a lot of

466
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:40,670
people were notorious enemy disruptive

467
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:43,160
innovations online men agent while

468
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,750
highly displayed once again positive

469
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,450
assess very love right anyone left to

470
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:49,250
learn percent all the way maybe 20

471
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:51,650
percent okay I have to take a compulsory

472
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:54,440
agency batting averages but we haven't I

473
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,270
think in American culture need to have

474
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:58,850
this notion of revolutionaries being

475
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:00,820
this romantic license

476
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:04,120
go back home history or any bill that

477
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,930
followers I got to close with startled

478
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:10,930
shirts we have to at least two phones

479
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:13,780
and kind of there we have this notion of

480
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:16,510
what you hope Star Wars giving up this

481
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:19,920
try Chrebet like white power

482
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:24,760
that's not the story I watch me I watch

483
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:29,620
leave with or the entire will start up

484
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,960
and then we have our trek back not good

485
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:35,440
news for the society because of being

486
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,760
instrumental in nations where it will

487
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,520
always lead in terms of some sense don't

488
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,690
always tend to enact another way of

489
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:46,030
looking at some instead of audience is I

490
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:48,070
like to look at it from the tunnel makes

491
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:50,850
a look at time on the x axis and then

492
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:53,200
modifications or people expectations on

493
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,170
the y axis this is what these gaining

494
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:58,360
ground nations doing right they're not

495
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,240
but if are going to it but it's not an

496
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,940
rocket in its just to meet mortgage

497
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,190
changes I don't apply people expect more

498
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,060
the multiple features

499
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:10,740
that's what bigger when you're giving us

500
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,940
breakthrough innovations right oh geez

501
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:16,600
new markets under fire market but if you

502
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,870
doing it in a way that I believe complex

503
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:21,670
so we're we're lucky jumping occur so

504
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:24,250
socially jumping occur again please your

505
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:29,350
matter that ripped nice again under Sun

506
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:32,290
but here's the only other disruptive

507
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:32,920
addition

508
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,750
disruptive innovation start below the

509
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:38,170
curve that's what you think thing that

510
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:40,900
you're asking in a worse position you're

511
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,300
trying to introduce up on it Unser's

512
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:46,930
that is inferior to what the market

513
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:49,600
already had so clearly improve your

514
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,490
customers create market you're targeting

515
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:55,480
emerging markets disruptive innovations

516
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,640
you're only a few inches small emergent

517
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,320
modules and you're endorsing on

518
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,120
different sets of value it's reading

519
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,220
these folks are hopeful indifference is

520
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,350
another touching right the is sustained

521
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:07,120
internal they're usually focused on the

522
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,180
Rivini customer their biggest offers

523
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,950
these guys focus on the folks are left

524
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:12,370
out

525
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:13,900
at the new markets

526
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:18,010
and underserved market and usually far

527
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:20,080
worse at least at least one earth these

528
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,040
pointy exterior so it's accessible right

529
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,960
folks right through a disruptive if

530
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,390
successful they can create new markets

531
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:30,070
that's an easy thing but again I just

532
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,840
want to highlight what's in it again

533
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,920
very well here down here sometime the

534
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,020
leader updater two stock recommendations

535
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:41,290
is in addition to our fiscal we talked a

536
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:43,900
lot about this and US law how can in

537
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:47,170
what can disrupt with zeros everything

538
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:49,480
is your on the mini copies we still stay

539
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,870
zero right oh you want any model versus

540
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:57,670
from partner if you remember and big

541
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:59,950
myself once again there who remembers us

542
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:04,990
huge printer staff and often than

543
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:07,330
accessing University a modulo operation

544
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:10,300
it was lonely offices of a half firing

545
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,490
operator if you're really a big

546
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:15,610
University ok provision the data right

547
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:18,970
visitors here we want hole punch back

548
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:22,360
side front line and collate everything

549
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,330
that walks into a pin and lock box moves

550
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:28,690
game may be standing came long what was

551
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:32,820
their target right on target audience

552
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:35,830
small businesses right among all sort of

553
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:38,620
home-based businesses so cannon came up

554
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:41,980
with this inferior right it is a crap

555
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,630
talkers you're not laughing

556
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:46,120
and in the first a motley that happening

557
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,550
tonight what we want that it's inferior

558
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:55,330
we the resolution on our target at any

559
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:58,600
actual coffee it's always business or

560
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,000
any business not mine whose huge shades

561
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,320
to work can find a place to go we're not

562
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,140
happen Arabia algún apples is from IBM

563
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,510
Samuel Wright who contains a partner

564
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:13,450
engaging personal PC I can knock down

565
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:15,550
again someone mention who is the

566
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:20,650
catenation DoD mainframe and there is

567
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:23,710
important they were making apple just

568
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:25,050
what we've done on this

569
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:27,450
easy and we have a big need more

570
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:29,520
tutorial on them over the soft that

571
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,310
cause really this is really sharp and

572
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:35,720
the system actually called this cheap

573
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:40,200
gas prices they Iranian or tomorrow

574
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,200
right yeah so what that happen right

575
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,110
they took our hostages and then consider

576
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:49,940
which turning on it's just more market

577
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:54,810
yeah so what between the new movie set

578
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:59,240
up performance country Univision's gas

579
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:02,280
expensive on lunch we get there you have

580
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:06,000
to work right and right big cars lots of

581
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,610
acceleration in supporting life until we

582
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:11,490
have the well shot that community may

583
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:14,310
attention study nine now continue on it

584
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:17,150
although he's on sorry display see

585
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:20,250
falling really over there right okay on

586
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:22,890
back end in their quality I was on par

587
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:27,900
but they he quickly who are rose on we

588
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,690
disrupted her and any thought of audio

589
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:33,780
and then we not like a nationally and

590
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:37,830
rounders were completely borders also

591
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:39,720
think there's anything would be creative

592
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,390
it's pretty hard to be civil

593
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:44,730
and they can take it they're just uh

594
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:48,000
container and on directed on they're

595
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,220
going offline or maybe their guard right

596
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,650
camera excuse that it was the Caddy wait

597
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:55,020
that was a cold smoke they're

598
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,820
conveniently committed to keeping on

599
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:59,460
this long so now we have the key the

600
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,770
undated being that they're going to be

601
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:02,550
tough with you

602
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:04,050
the Chinese will need you coming out in

603
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:07,560
arteries the cherries what the Hyundai's

604
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:11,310
are getting bigger or fix this motion

605
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:14,040
destruction black people on that evening

606
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,520
part or not today we think of a

607
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,070
destructive in munitions recently that's

608
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:23,670
one potential might be exactly right

609
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:25,620
I would agree with Tesla if it wasn't as

610
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:29,340
expensive as healthy pencil trick over

611
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:32,130
power solar power mightily but it's too

612
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:35,880
long me times many times other than

613
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,560
gonna discuss bees you have done

614
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:43,800
he now knows off the iPhone as well but

615
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,990
I phone is really not competing against

616
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:47,820
the commercial vodka pediatric and

617
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,020
conservative who's competing with

618
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,570
blackberry and blackberry over the beach

619
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:55,080
in a classroom or a keyboard right if

620
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,970
you talk to a parent like where you talk

621
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:58,680
to all their CEOs when there's food left

622
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,080
hand black going on in early 2000

623
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,840
everyone wants a bigger people I protect

624
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:09,780
us until ski-jumping long easy work I'm

625
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:13,950
going to get a touchdown see that and so

626
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:17,310
a great indicator of American II know

627
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:21,060
your instructors is is one of these I

628
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:24,060
have a green light or Latin that's what

629
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:27,090
keeps not lucky does not if these guys

630
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:30,390
laugh I think they have to lose their

631
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:32,550
life Nicky if these are in the dream

632
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,490
line is to say dat are not overlapping

633
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:37,200
you're doing destruction your problem in

634
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,240
what trap that's all the indicator even

635
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:43,310
like especially if they're doing a filet

636
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:45,690
for sponsoring that a was never

637
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:47,780
considered a community ultimate

638
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,980
especially weird service constructive

639
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:52,080
emission come up because it's I'm

640
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,700
working on something certain again just

641
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,320
want to make sure everyone the city is

642
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,270
McNabb Richmond representations of you

643
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,370
did you if I'm seeing stuff on tempers

644
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:10,020
creation that and interesting okay so

645
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:13,050
Hockley math tech a future so wonderful

646
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:16,170
all of the generals are talking to folks

647
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:18,480
being a spot on disruptive innovation

648
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,640
but I'm just thinking we really do need

649
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,700
you all I'm not what is it suggests

650
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,500
disruptive innovation I wanted to be

651
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,940
doing all at least especially the fire

652
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,880
engines excited about to blast it

653
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:33,180
incomes is too much cyber touches every

654
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:36,330
syllable main worker by clicking elder

655
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:39,270
or still compartmental anymore we still

656
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:41,160
say the land component the air component

657
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:44,460
seat remoteness and in the planned the

658
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:47,310
12 explore emotions but every digital

659
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:49,620
are inside so a big component works it

660
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,759
pleases

661
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:52,859
now anakin components but are currently

662
00:33:52,859 --> 00:33:54,869
fiber called actually way we should be

663
00:33:54,869 --> 00:33:55,499
being mom

664
00:33:55,499 --> 00:33:58,919
cyber worker so I should be doing long

665
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:01,499
but again I'm gonna practices history

666
00:34:01,499 --> 00:34:03,629
once again consider risk of not being

667
00:34:03,629 --> 00:34:06,659
about destruction and the last three

668
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:09,029
major order that we can reduce community

669
00:34:09,029 --> 00:34:11,699
a military type of presentation creating

670
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:14,668
what was the fault Mary well one problem

671
00:34:14,668 --> 00:34:16,259
we have never Overlord

672
00:34:16,259 --> 00:34:17,819
I'm in hell all in the police action

673
00:34:17,819 --> 00:34:20,159
poignant position a big thing with the

674
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,210
Chinese artists a a general debarker

675
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:25,710
consistently underestimated the Chinese

676
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:28,799
army strength by a hacker can how can

677
00:34:28,799 --> 00:34:30,329
you win on any ballot when you can

678
00:34:30,329 --> 00:34:32,668
sustain direct me their phone and factor

679
00:34:32,668 --> 00:34:36,710
and what would John MacArthur delight

680
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:39,230
what in town ask if you think is

681
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:45,629
moderate and online zealand record you

682
00:34:45,629 --> 00:34:48,509
do perfectly don't agree what you choose

683
00:34:48,509 --> 00:34:50,789
to talk to like an awful so much Angela

684
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:53,099
xanthine is the Potter cream what the

685
00:34:53,099 --> 00:34:57,509
limitation of vegetable oil imagery time

686
00:34:57,509 --> 00:34:59,640
off is blasted illegible oxygen trees

687
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,220
the Chinese what about the Inuit they

688
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:05,119
did their movements exclusively at night

689
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:07,829
that's what a barter is this people

690
00:35:07,829 --> 00:35:10,170
underestimate their sake again I'm

691
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:11,369
throwing on an imposter

692
00:35:11,369 --> 00:35:13,470
I would be firing into a circle I was

693
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:18,450
chasing a junkie without Vietnam whose

694
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:19,799
motion to Chinchero

695
00:35:19,799 --> 00:35:23,759
we have aerial bombers that were all

696
00:35:23,759 --> 00:35:27,000
given credit for be an Air Force Ones we

697
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,390
had aerial government in the Vietnam war

698
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:34,109
machine visions on the spot and yes we

699
00:35:34,109 --> 00:35:36,299
could want sponsors promotions equal the

700
00:35:36,299 --> 00:35:39,079
whole teacher he bomb the heck other run

701
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:42,829
when nice tradition under running water

702
00:35:42,829 --> 00:35:44,609
under on the TV

703
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:47,160
we dropped fun and putting the minutes

704
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:52,049
more died in the World War two if you

705
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:54,000
can think of a part of Bonnie pop on

706
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,640
over to Dresden you think of that we've

707
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,109
got more organs order ho chi minh chau

708
00:35:59,109 --> 00:36:02,259
top problems we never understood or on

709
00:36:02,259 --> 00:36:04,119
the third of course people didn't figure

710
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:06,160
out how to control initiative with not

711
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,349
hard to adjust the strap with all rapper

712
00:36:08,349 --> 00:36:11,980
man that make us to jump on there and

713
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:14,829
that and go around and never smart

714
00:36:14,829 --> 00:36:16,960
people pumping their greater to go

715
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,940
around so initially the close to the

716
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,619
trail of injustice

717
00:36:20,619 --> 00:36:22,690
eventually was like as in world war not

718
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:24,759
the intensity Native American students

719
00:36:24,759 --> 00:36:27,430
but at times to it on campus including

720
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:32,170
about the norms no respond record Anika

721
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:39,249
by each air it just in general if old

722
00:36:39,249 --> 00:36:41,680
wardens right organs that was up over

723
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:45,700
the Iraq war I suppose their internet

724
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:49,119
mortar shell I've done from the bathroom

725
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:52,960
I initially lost the blood was a

726
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,359
transition or pressure initiate date on

727
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:57,910
the other Lobos is repaid with remote

728
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:01,089
control devices of two dollars in big

729
00:37:01,089 --> 00:37:03,190
not initially very foods affected

730
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:05,609
disrupted especially to the US military

731
00:37:05,609 --> 00:37:08,289
and we're not compared for that

732
00:37:08,289 --> 00:37:09,849
infrastructure right we thought we were

733
00:37:09,849 --> 00:37:11,799
the best my block you can deal with any

734
00:37:11,799 --> 00:37:13,269
military it sucks when you're not

735
00:37:13,269 --> 00:37:15,819
another we're doing with religious myth

736
00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:18,730
on the way onto media streams the Boston

737
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:21,009
Marathon bomber yeah petrichor

738
00:37:21,009 --> 00:37:23,319
as all of us right pressure cooker with

739
00:37:23,319 --> 00:37:25,779
some baroque lecture pretty symbolic as

740
00:37:25,779 --> 00:37:27,789
people are much better more you got

741
00:37:27,789 --> 00:37:31,450
yourself on pleasure looks for a lot of

742
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:33,039
us today point

743
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:36,579
please malar on Lovitz I'm a lot of

744
00:37:36,579 --> 00:37:39,130
mostly initial versions of them mostly

745
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:41,739
for instructor and we talked also Nana

746
00:37:41,739 --> 00:37:43,569
can be a turn out the cabinet to stage

747
00:37:43,569 --> 00:37:45,549
right get their version different

748
00:37:45,549 --> 00:37:47,470
intervals return patching and finding

749
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:49,660
Adams the internet but initial course

750
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:53,019
and usually are not this much chocolate

751
00:37:53,019 --> 00:37:55,690
yeah are there announcer break again

752
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,630
stuff coming out of Russia of the tummy

753
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:00,970
on China and that's per suppressed yes

754
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:02,200
they're coming out them to work through

755
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,079
that scary because we can't even

756
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:10,059
entertain on many of these disruptive

757
00:38:10,059 --> 00:38:11,390
points

758
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:16,079
well I'm one about tired here so I this

759
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:21,359
would be a good place to wait can we get

760
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:24,299
well very quickly just a hacker's

761
00:38:24,299 --> 00:38:26,969
dictionary right is someone or an

762
00:38:26,969 --> 00:38:28,289
earlier talk they'd like to sort of have

763
00:38:28,289 --> 00:38:30,450
to write Filipino compression and if I

764
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:32,819
don't have to I'm not introducing on a

765
00:38:32,819 --> 00:38:36,859
whole lot in terms we vertically here

766
00:38:36,859 --> 00:38:41,299
again asserted is props to Star Wars I

767
00:38:41,299 --> 00:38:43,529
like to start record logic to keep some

768
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:45,779
of the Star Trek shoes welter sort right

769
00:38:45,779 --> 00:38:47,880
I'm calling the crackers if I'm a packet

770
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,619
of disruptive all he's going to try and

771
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,180
drink the holes united against the stage

772
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:54,509
usually not your lawmaker not quite a

773
00:38:54,509 --> 00:38:57,059
 or the destructive innovator

774
00:38:57,059 --> 00:38:58,799
started building the backbone right or

775
00:38:58,799 --> 00:39:00,930
slide town that's okay if you're

776
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:02,369
breaking off on the back there I'm

777
00:39:02,369 --> 00:39:04,069
calling you a great resume

778
00:39:04,069 --> 00:39:07,049
I'm telling you a cat stuck in a tree

779
00:39:07,049 --> 00:39:08,249
bones bon voyage

780
00:39:08,249 --> 00:39:14,369
that's okay um yeah slackers yeah one

781
00:39:14,369 --> 00:39:16,589
wonders placards with me I'm saying

782
00:39:16,589 --> 00:39:18,930
that's okay so if it's like cyber white

783
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:20,999
hackers and then there's my cell phone

784
00:39:20,999 --> 00:39:23,069
that has its own folks but again I took

785
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:26,039
the risk committee via physical fitness

786
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:27,960
records there on Shack attacker in a

787
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,910
package sweater right again

788
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:34,440
anima currently in addition for all but

789
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,289
again I'm hoping most of us on the

790
00:39:37,289 --> 00:39:39,809
hydrogen side think for climbing a cyber

791
00:39:39,809 --> 00:39:41,789
tracker or a chart like good to be on

792
00:39:41,789 --> 00:39:43,890
the Jewish Federation especially when

793
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:45,450
they start Trek Enterprise world by

794
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:47,339
yourself you look you're only like this

795
00:39:47,339 --> 00:39:52,559
really you have fun directing people

796
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:56,039
always have fun or you just and with

797
00:39:56,039 --> 00:40:00,059
that I will yeah time so think I've

798
00:40:00,059 --> 00:40:06,049
talked to one question yeah

799
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:17,160
yeah I personally believe that sense

800
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,920
from destructive emissions comes from

801
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,160
generating this emerging market and gain

802
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,560
that all you have to get home give you

803
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,560
the test and look at all and I'm telling

804
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:33,330
you did it work so who's never earth on

805
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,550
where you know that is look is pretty

806
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:38,940
popular but worthy but what my sis not

807
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:39,480
other

808
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:44,820
anodizing about a Google bus a lot even

809
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,740
yes like in a lot of examples of

810
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:49,410
disruptive innovation and I did one day

811
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:51,690
medisoft right disrupting this horn so

812
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:53,460
if you want to keep inside of that wall

813
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,770
and you have to make sure under some

814
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:57,900
condition the value fighters is like

815
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,340
you're looking at and try and prove that

816
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:02,790
copying net on this internet looks after

817
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:08,000
one that are valued by the undershirt

818
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,220
yeah yeah perfect sauce is really how we

819
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:24,090
do this how do we get through without

820
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:25,200
doing last wish

821
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,880
so highly become a slightest racket

822
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,940
right you're absolutely trekkers ever

823
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:34,140
tracker that's why I love these hacker

824
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:38,600
conferences it was security numbers um I

825
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:42,240
want to leverage the hacking and all the

826
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,910
folks are happy especially they want to

827
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:46,290
hit them you know the Lawson's

828
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:48,180
they just want a month and they found a

829
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:51,120
hole if you find right again those

830
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:54,000
verses have to be right the white collar

831
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,060
they're using terminals or catches cat

832
00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:00,720
eg criminals to figure out what she's

833
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,820
been debating with in the spot for

834
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:03,480
themselves

835
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,760
that's why 111th I'm going to leverage

836
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,670
those hackers and body folks that were

837
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:10,890
letters those folks who not only find it

838
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:14,010
holds but that is unable to easy fixes

839
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:15,960
because usually is an easy fix

840
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:18,510
right usually not a straight they're not

841
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:21,060
telling me what you need it's AI system

842
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:21,509
right

843
00:42:21,509 --> 00:42:24,299
I'm an amiable beyond I think it's

844
00:42:24,299 --> 00:42:24,630
helpful

845
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:27,359
I'm enamel automation if you help but

846
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:30,299

00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:33,659
me you got in or she on it or can tell

848
00:42:33,659 --> 00:42:35,789
me what the other players action stop

849
00:42:35,789 --> 00:42:39,269
that right from life I'm with the guy

850

the guy that open up that enable expired

851
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:45,659
that's a Jesus minor traffic we didn't

852
00:42:45,659 --> 00:42:47,759
like that our new chapter that I those

853
00:42:47,759 --> 00:42:51,059
are easy fixes to what we think is from

854
00:42:51,059 --> 00:42:53,939
are all other leverage significant I

855
00:42:53,939 --> 00:42:56,369

856
00:42:56,369 --> 00:42:59,819
way of thinking and acting on with that

857
