construction work gets up we add to that

34
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,930
it violated you can have a sense of

35

been doing this for over 20 years I get

43
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:45,500
involved if I'm one of those people that

44
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:50,100
my career was chosen by others okay I

45
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,229
have no time to anything I did at the

46
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:54,630
start of the military almost actually

47
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,280
work with the National Security Agency I

48
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,140
was in the Navy and I worked with an

49
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,000
admiral Apple said you know I forget

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,590
where it is you know the entire computer

51
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,850
this is a 1986 they know the computing

52
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,890
environment was around it you know what

53
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,288
computer was but if they're being on set

54
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:10,929
me on

55
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:13,000
and it's been downhill since then all

56
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,280
right so yeah I am a professor of such

57
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,480
security at the George Washington

58
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,390
University of Chicago University and a

59
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,189
full-time professor at City College in

60
00:02:21,189 --> 00:02:22,420
Nashville from Columbia College does

61
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,689
anybody know those places increment in I

62
00:02:25,689 --> 00:02:27,159
love the community college I think it's

63
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:30,340
great I have put it into training of any

64
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,049
kind of lucky maybe cryptography Center

65
00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:34,810
/ - really well and I think the entire

66
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:36,549
intelligence came to the army anybody

67
00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:39,459
people use as there are people I look

68
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:41,170
down to San Antonio Texas one of our

69
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,150
problem people and having interviewed

70
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,440
you know this is before the whole board

71
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,599
important thing you different do that in

72
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,970
oh yeah I've done a lot of other stuff

73
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:50,639
those are complete diesel forensics

74
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:53,980
personal I have a super hot sexy mind

75
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,170
from what am i this is being paid for

76
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,000
because they kid should have to make

77
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,549
sure I say that actually told me that

78
00:02:59,549 --> 00:03:02,799
and so today we have traffic isn't a

79
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:05,200
fiance after me and I'm a member of

80
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,849
obscenity has character and other key

81
00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:08,319
Nokia because when you have cyber you

82
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,450
can to pray a lot it's not how they wear

83
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,769
that know when I started praying

84
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:13,689
anybody ever work with is people doesn't

85
00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:20,349
eat those serves tax I remember a pilot

86
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:21,730
or 10:00 at night and trade

87
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:24,160
we've got let this come back up that I

88
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,470
want to be from all night so that's how

89
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:29,199
I started alright so basically we're

90
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:30,819
going to want to talk about exports to

91
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:33,250
charge I found this worthless our

92
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,199
security community and by reality mark

93
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:38,260
on that people don't really understand

94
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,150
what exploit kids are and they're really

95
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,750
you kind of hurting us from us a

96
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,340
security perspective and and also we'll

97
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,750
talk about the or the lipstick crime

98
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,310
where and also ransomware which is

99
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,560
becoming very big and so there's going

100
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,500
to be all render for today alright so

101
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,150
Troy where as a service to becoming a

102
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,030
very good thing can you tell me why

103
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,159
invoice cyber crime ballooning or

104
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,959
whether you don't have a second it's

105
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:04,510
probably on is thank you so much it's

106
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,190
awful who's going to jail for this stuff

107
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,220
no one where I'm going to get shocking

108
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,530
to me so I mean a good job security

109
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,599
broad protector that q1 people grooving

110
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,159
if your job motivated make sense I'm

111
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:17,738
hearing enough oh yeah

112
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:20,870
but essentially yeah I mean

113
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,130
go anywhere because it's profitable

114
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,979
simple as that and you know it's

115
00:04:24,979 --> 00:04:26,660
actually even about you know some of

116
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,919
these terms like now where is the

117
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,360
service some of you have heard of it

118
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,690
ransomware data service I mean I'll turn

119
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:35,419
it out I see another way to webinar or

120
00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:37,940
why I'm somewhere article under 30 month

121
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,580
up I mean I understand it is all over

122
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,050
the place and people are going to impact

123
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,760
it back and if you can impacted by

124
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,760
ransomware yet yeah I have content

125
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,350
that's impacted by I'm not in a very

126
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,389
serious way what I'll turn out in a way

127
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:54,229
that I'm talking about prayer I once ran

128
00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:55,789
to my started to come popular couple

129
00:04:55,789 --> 00:04:59,000
years ago that kept me up enough because

130
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,100
coming toward NSA and educating the

131
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,410
tower cryptography I knew there wasn't a

132
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,780
good solution and I just remember really

133
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,220
pointing I hope another like let's get

134
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,720
this stuff because they don't edit at

135
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,289
all from just encrypting JPEG files and

136
00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:14,060
Excel spreadsheets and we're documents

137
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,820
after blowing out to mass drives and

138
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,610
people including an entire P Drive or a

139
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,680
G Drive I mean it would be really really

140
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,020
devastating especially since I'm using

141
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,490
them you may pay the ransom and not

142
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,740
necessarily get them your money back if

143
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,660
that working process rinse and where the

144
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,630
service a Venetian honor insurance

145
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,880
really it's maybe creating this stuff

146
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,710
really not about that

147
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:37,849
in fact that everything about the

148
00:05:37,849 --> 00:05:40,070
support cumulative just arrests for

149
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,470
Atlanta where you hear about that in

150
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:45,080
Japan they arrested a fourteen-year-old

151
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,720
for baiting Rankin we're going to make

152
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,930
these 14 years old and so what I think

153
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,789
about their ransom are the services are

154
00:05:52,789 --> 00:05:54,560
something that could be supported burned

155
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,630
out yeah and you're going to see why it

156
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,639
should not be illegal to you but

157
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,669
typically it's going to be created if we

158
00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:03,590
call it a theory atop right you know I

159
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,419
see the hard work of developer create

160
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:08,630
this person is good code and then what

161
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,130
I'm going to do I'm not an expert of

162
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:11,750
distribution so I'm going to find

163
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,160
someone who's an expert in distribution

164
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,190
is distribu that for me and so it's okay

165
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:18,410
it provides away and to the ransom our

166
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,300
market without needed technical skills

167
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,139
now it almost kind of bothers me where

168
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:26,539
when I hear that on be able to hear

169
00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:28,099
about strip games you call them skate

170
00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:28,419
now

171
00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:30,070
I mean

172
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,170
and you don't have some technical

173
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:34,210
ability stuff you want to do this stuff

174
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:37,270
you know to distribute power you know

175
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,980
maybe not for the level of the developer

176
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,300
because you know a lot of people that

177
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,340
distribution just like awesome aspire to

178
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,200
be professional skill set for different

179
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,330
why you want to do but you still have to

180
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:50,140
have some technical doing this and have

181
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,670
abused at the high level that the

182
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:54,550
developer has so I'm getting a really

183
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:57,340
good example of charges particularly

184
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,980
this but this kind of trip speed up the

185
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,590
affiliate models and this year this was

186
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:07,870
a semantic on and dark networking

187
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:10,390
services for essentially in this these

188
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:13,300
lines here they're discussing a 70/30

189
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,760
split so you know I'm the ransomware

190
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,980
developer other if you know wherever you

191
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,990
distribute I'll take 30 percent on me

192
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:22,660
get 70 percent up and continue tactic we

193
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:28,090
should really go in future okay so let's

194
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:29,890
talk talking about exporting payloads as

195
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:31,420
if people don't understand what they are

196
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,150
so exploit is and you look at the

197
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,710
Centers for something maybe go to school

198
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,480
go Rome or Venice code it takes

199
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,240
advantage of volatility sometimes a

200
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,670
floor or weakness okay so that's only

201
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,370
part of it right all right so that's

202
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:47,290
what this offer applications have the

203
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:51,430
hold on great what but will really want

204
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,350
to try to do it to exploit that

205
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:56,040
vulnerability is really execute code

206
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:01,060
okay so exploit once again is the

207
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,100
vulnerability but the ultimate goal is

208
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,160
to experts are conical code and usually

209
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,660
back code we're going to call that

210
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,000
payload and what can that pay will be

211
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,430
well today looks like you know it right

212
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:15,040
to where three months I'm not presenting

213
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,350
from MarketWatch concession and our same

214
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,180
ransomware

215
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:22,960
anybody know who can be done hi I mean

216
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,320
guarantee them okay if you remember the

217
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,200
early days of malware and I remember

218
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,289
just now were these noise or in the

219
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:34,210
numbers of early monies and the midnight

220
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:37,539
you can have a malware that what was

221
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:40,270
supposed you have Bart Simpson not with

222
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,950
and told me crazy in

223
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:44,380
well some people remember that yeah I

224
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,720
mean it consumed resources but was very

225
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,910
very people for every easy to give it up

226
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:52,600
and even early ransomware was easy to

227
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,070
get rid of leave to get into that

228
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,079
parking fee of Island PC obviously to

229
00:08:56,079 --> 00:08:58,839
target rich environment but we got that

230
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:02,019
back scan where we don't even detected

231
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:05,740
it here is surfing child porn silence is

232
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:08,529
that the FBI warning you know and you

233
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:10,660
know that's kind of a quarterly for

234
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,220
repair somewhere because it's not the

235
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,209
encrypting page

236
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:15,310
no smells really easy to text you know

237
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,230
when it's windows revision when this

238
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,699
profile and was gone

239
00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:20,380
there's a physical but there's something

240
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,449
we're seeing today is more and more

241
00:09:22,449 --> 00:09:24,010
sophisticated I'll turn right now I just

242
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:26,410
don't see that opening up and so this

243
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:28,870
table whether it goes to stolen put kind

244
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,579
of folder where the defective children

245
00:09:30,579 --> 00:09:33,970
or hooky remote access older okay really

246
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,829
that's what's really doing a dance and

247
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:38,079
so one of these exploit kids this

248
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:40,089
Christmas work software call abilities

249
00:09:40,089 --> 00:09:42,610
to distribute value they typically do

250
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:45,070
develop and so on some kind of got that

251
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:47,110
market and anybody been on the Tor

252
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,329
network right certain rights around on

253
00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:53,350
that stuff yeah so um you know white or

254
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:56,170
that wall you know tour provides this

255
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,820
anonymity price that they could be

256
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,610
because I said to do what they need to

257
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:03,100
do although I think the FBI found to be

258
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,290
good it you know really want to find a

259
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:07,420
source of some stuff they're able to do

260
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:10,300
that but to launder stuff is done on the

261
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,279
Tor network be sent to create the

262
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,740
anonymity next provide and the notice

263
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,279
that it's existed since 2006 eighty desk

264
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:20,709
week it so they're not making admit one

265
00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:22,300
thing about them is that they come with

266
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,040
these colorful nation okay

267
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,560
right and it was very kind of total sexy

268
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,990
interesting name and it sort of contra

269
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,790
see this but when it is not a study that

270
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,769
came out by Palo Alto last year that

271
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:35,260
said the dominant expert if they were

272
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,029
seeing as of July 2016

273
00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:39,760
we're between our angler be clear the

274
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,680
neutrino manual nucleus that is do those

275
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,079
terms calculator you can see them come

276
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,589
on headline bill the time so I look at

277
00:10:47,589 --> 00:10:48,760
what's in the characters which are

278
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,140
pretty desperate kitchen this is an

279
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:53,140
actual screen graph of the black hole

280
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,560
exploitation

281
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,940
about the people one thing I notice

282
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,950
right away why do I keep slender

283
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,650
brushing in college because my husband

284
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:06,620
Amy Amy was the Soviet Union yeah we're

285
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:10,090
community speaking Russian right now

286
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:15,320
what oh yeah that's right so yeah this

287
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,300
is definitely suited here but what's

288
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,190
beautiful about me that ever have seen a

289
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:21,320
couple of the mansion counselors they're

290
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,339
absolutely beautiful

291
00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:24,620
but you know they'll he'll show you you

292
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,839
know who this excellent expertise of

293
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,150
versions of web browsers it'll even

294
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,550
coming but country it will tell you what

295
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:34,700
operating system should be more your for

296
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,350
bad guys getting maybe in your great

297
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:39,620
products in somewhere immune crates you

298
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,500
know managing the top of our system to

299
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,850
network you know from the comfort of

300
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:44,630
your home

301
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:47,060
the advantage at console like this so we

302
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,370
typically BK you can have a very fancy

303
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:51,110
management console that's very highly

304
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,750
polished and here's our other sample to

305
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,810
these interfaces okay they're going to

306
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:59,180
deliver excellence right and the biggest

307
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,760
is it'll find out if that system that

308
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,740
maybe was take it to some websites

309
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,170
okay that is compromised organelles it

310
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:07,630
depends on the attacker whether they're

311
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:10,880
hooking up on some attachment that's in

312
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,520
compromise whether that system is going

313
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,410
to be vulnerable to that expert or not

314
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:17,839
tender because of many exploits when I

315
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,700
started this we that you go to luggage

316
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,700
like one website when actually what but

317
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,260
it doesn't mean what makes excellent

318
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,720
really attractive is that the attackers

319
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,020
have a pool of exploits so there I love

320
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,580
and I don't know if you notice it on the

321
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:34,520
back guys okay so you know it ability

322
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,620
subset and just one of that people that

323
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:42,680
have a Linux low mass in other words

324
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,380
people oh but you're going to go he'll

325
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,180
know you know I'll go to this

326
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,130
compromised I don't see that a highly

327
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:51,830
polished and certain version and it may

328
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:54,410
not download an excellence at all but

329
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,720
invasion originally in Windows 7

330
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,360
okay they Eskimo mobility that we can

331
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,420
expose the download Xcode and after we

332
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,670
do this is event that decreases the

333
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,990
likelihood actually they're being

334
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,529
detected they should have done

335
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:09,449
school of uh schools or anything

336
00:13:09,449 --> 00:13:11,699
continuing updates in exports is very

337
00:13:11,699 --> 00:13:14,310
very aggressive you know when you think

338
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:17,730
about that and impacted by a lot of

339
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,970
crime and then you have to be in the

340
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:23,519
water card I was really unhappy want to

341
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,800
cry weeks two weeks ago I was really

342
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,629
unhappy we spent a lot of color makes me

343
00:13:27,629 --> 00:13:29,610
feel they're applied for all of them and

344
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:31,170
you think if we got the up debate on

345
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:33,029
captions and for the most part we

346
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:35,339
thought we were that was my point or not

347
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:39,420
I have 120,000 as well and it does what

348
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,870
their laptops that in a drawer that

349
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:45,720
are only taken out for presentations

350
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,939
every couple of months that we have and

351
00:13:47,939 --> 00:13:49,740
so yeah I mean you know today truly

352
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,959
photos detectives you have to make sure

353
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:54,720
that those systems have been updated but

354
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,999
you know when you look at how tellement

355
00:13:56,999 --> 00:14:00,449
tough really poor that experts to be

356
00:14:00,449 --> 00:14:02,279
taken advantage of by the bad guys

357
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:03,779
you know whatever it leads part of that

358
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:06,480
they have and wasn't really very long so

359
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,189
you know the bad guys are actually

360
00:14:08,189 --> 00:14:10,680
military our trip to see bees for minor

361
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,629
area or may not hold availability on get

362
00:14:12,629 --> 00:14:14,939
what they're pushing out that's where

363
00:14:14,939 --> 00:14:17,819
you feedback can anybody get one is what

364
00:14:17,819 --> 00:14:21,779
we're doing that what we show even for

365
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:24,629
the traditional for-profit company what

366
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:27,569
are you doing well the contingent fee

367
00:14:27,569 --> 00:14:29,370
over it's a way though they've got make

368
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,350
you that they thought the best product

369
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:33,629
will compared to competitors it now they

370
00:14:33,629 --> 00:14:35,250
may come a technical support

371
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,430
okay should be a problem you know that

372
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:40,470
actually remote into your system and a

373
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,120
there's any problems to make things work

374
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,129
and they often include license

375
00:14:44,129 --> 00:14:45,660
agreements and this one is called areas

376
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,480
for me because you know bad guys we

377
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,300
can't trust that guy okay it's a suite

378
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,490
or the room and on the translates for

379
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:54,959
you what it says here it says the

380
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,149
translation in cases of violations of

381
00:14:57,149 --> 00:14:59,819
the agreement and being detected the

382
00:14:59,819 --> 00:15:02,160
client uses any technical support rural

383
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,679
where the binary total robot will be

384
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:06,600
immediately sensing is have our spunky

385
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,790
and so no forget they have to protect

386
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:13,559
their remedies so some of our famous

387
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:15,870
expertise that we've seen is dispersals

388
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:18,149
called black that lack of exploitation

389
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:20,250
and encourages him up

390
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:23,810
name is ponch and I hear God's name oh

391
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:26,430
yeah he was a very very big deal

392
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:28,980
so he was caught and I was encouraged

393
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,140
shot Iverson and I on the working us

394
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,300
start intelligence company but how do

395
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,500
you think going to jail

396
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,540
these are Russians in Russia it was June

397
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,550
right what we can happen I mean I've got

398
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:44,940
a scary incident right here my fear you

399
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,430
know the unwritten rule is Russia is

400
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:50,190
basically Elijah you can have whoever

401
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:52,470
you want just don't tap your fellow

402
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:55,980
Russians and every time and I picked it

403
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,840
a lot both of us apostasy went into

404
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,050
Russian happiness records because they

405
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:06,210
have internally so my sense if are

406
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:09,270
either reflected and also it's been only

407
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:11,630
the capitals of collude with Russian

408
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:14,550
government and Russian law enforcement

409
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,680
who knows maybe somebody didn't get the

410
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,320
payoff they're expecting okay and then

411
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,240
this is what happened then we've got

412
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,280
this another pony to instill in the

413
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,620
Risen air of beauty delivery of still

414
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,900
deliverance tables via RLS by talking

415
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:31,560
John Hall very surprised renfa-sama and

416
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:35,100
then um you know ever maybe in a

417
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,839
position where you did not see each

418
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:41,580
other organizations yeah I mean at this

419
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,260
article and video that's why there's a

420
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:46,220
back you know lapses in the blacks right

421
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,500
it's basically some if you can not not

422
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,350
need organization show capacity then we

423
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:55,800
have anglers dominated up this spk on

424
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,110
Orkut for very long time now notice here

425
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:00,930
it disappeared into 2015 because there

426
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:02,640
was a rest of fifty work for fifty

427
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,920
minutes of this game amused are

428
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,230
disputing but look at it they estimated

429
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:11,849
income up to 60,000 a year six minutes

430
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:14,189
we add all our salaries in this room I

431
00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:16,319
know I worked insider we do not mix

432
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,500
admissible as our your total okay does

433
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,060
this give anyone second thoughts about

434
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,740
it quickly

435
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,760
to decide but she took me all right so

436
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,590
come on the Halloween optics so really

437
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,720
there to grant the descriptive evening a

438
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,520
happy for your sister be compacted by

439
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,220
next week get right a person abusers go

440
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,110
to visit or more likely is redirected to

441
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:40,050
website is hoping and it's legit and so

442
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:41,640
you don't necessarily have to attend to

443
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,710
doable most effective every bar and some

444
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:45,780
constructs create commercials and early

445
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,460
on country adult going to be sacrifice

446
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,260
right because there's less than the

447
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,160
potential if you're going to get

448
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,290
compromised good so all you're gonna do

449
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:54,390
is would go to some optimized website

450
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:55,679
and booster compromised

451
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,150
well I know you you're kinda been

452
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:59,190
compromising in there and compromise we

453
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:01,020
almost anyone that's legitimate and

454
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,700
we'll see an example of a few legitimate

455
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,860
about seconds compliment and then also

456
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,870
you have to adderall ability that can be

457
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:09,300
escalation if I go to that top of my

458
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,710
choice happens in my bathroom they don't

459
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,720
have a map exploit and I'm now going to

460
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,640
be okay or if I multiply the decisions

461
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,290
I'm probably going to be oh that's why

462
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:20,240
are they help our signals is thank you

463
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,429
so how do they work so there was problem

464
00:18:23,429 --> 00:18:25,800
exploits or browser exploits you should

465
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,990
find that browser

466
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,000
yeah yeah by they're going option

467
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,370
surprising right because really what's

468
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:33,750
the application that use me to use the

469
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,809
host it's over what that in your end

470
00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:38,730
users what's the application of endings

471
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:41,520
of is web browsers right so it's very

472
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,230
it's probably right the number one most

473
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,179
companies app so why not try to exploit

474
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:47,580
that and notice that is addictive is

475
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,740
found to be bundled vulnerability and

476
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,020
the kids go to download the payroll

477
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,420
process and also an example of that so

478
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,890
you'll notice that I've intimate before

479
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:58,290
it they don't want to be detectives is

480
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:59,730
what happens when will detect then we

481
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:01,170
can do all kinds of blocking and

482
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:03,150
protections against it so when they saw

483
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:06,000
a feel agree but basically query on that

484
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,380
computer and they're only go to download

485
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:14,850
the exploit for potato that that just

486
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,320
don't stop down below me you know

487
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,360
they're they're choosing you know if I

488
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,179
got a twenty potential things I can

489
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:22,920
download and I'm going to do I'm going

490
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,450
to pick the worst which likely to work

491
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:27,660
on the tribe one-by-one passes and so no

492
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,730
not now once they're on your network

493
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:31,080
like and one that device and they can

494
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,610
make a great they can do whatever they

495
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:34,919
want to do and if I was a little toppers

496
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:35,430
doable

497
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,960
has all the gold was running in

498
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,630
Washington DC we have our government as

499
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,870
support governments have supported on

500
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,950
for-profit companies right and the

501
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:46,170
motivations are different my guests here

502
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:49,440
in this area that you probably targeted

503
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,240
by nation state and please correct me if

504
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,890
I'm wrong you're in this mess you know

505
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:54,630
there's lots of opportunity to take a

506
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:56,640
pass by cyber Colonel but I think

507
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,230
initiatives members in this area and I

508
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,300
see a lot of things I hope rocket well

509
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,680
what I mean press on them

510
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,290
there's for me yeah I'm using targeted

511
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,840
by nation states that like you more to

512
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,940
the typical one you just trying on it is

513
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,820
what it is you know we thought after the

514
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,490
DC right you know the nature the attack

515
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:18,990
really depends on the goal of crap so

516
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:21,540
let's give an example on compromising

517
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,550
start here so this victim is going to

518
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:26,430
visit a compromised website okay is it

519
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,380
we don't know how percent unity

520
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,180
navigators who directly or maybe they

521
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,040
were redirected to that question but it

522
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,320
isn't malicious and and then this work

523
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,210
there web pages but it's contact from

524
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,310
kind of exploit landing page the

525
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:40,050
excellent change is going to find what

526
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:41,970
the best difference is multiple just

527
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,320
going to go to look at the

528
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,150
characteristics of a visitor let's power

529
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:47,880
and its rules and Spyro levels now

530
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,380
notice that it knows all these are

531
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,880
valuable this nothing happens

532
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,870
okay you have is 99% or not right oh but

533
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:57,420
your windows eager okay because what's

534
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,430
going to happen so send that up certain

535
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:06,540
event don't jumping office all right so

536
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:10,440
since exploit up able to the business

537
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,960
okay so this came here determined that

538
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,970
this would be appropriate export an

539
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:17,280
Iraqi won't be together and follow that

540
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,770
respond that Felipe those but a horrible

541
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:23,130
possible exploits that have is what is

542
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:26,130
really serving the one if you but if the

543
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:28,560
beauty others here that we've got this

544
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,900
whole pool of possibility here which

545
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,170
makes infection just more like and so

546
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:36,450
let's look at one example of an

547
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:38,730
infection using religious would get and

548
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,190
bottom which was a piece of ransomware

549
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:43,650
that was a pretty famous at the law back

550
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:46,530
prom so this is a look

551
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:48,600
to see if the change next year is

552
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,760
injective stripping the page from a Kaka

553
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,190
my website will show you this there's

554
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:55,110
going to be other that the day afraid

555
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:59,160
gate comes from the TLB the top-level

556
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,560
domain that was being used

557
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,200
okay this even against a regex foot kick

558
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,730
which is going to redirect you to a

559
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:07,950
download or for walking and then you're

560
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:09,090
going to actually get the locking

561
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:11,670
ransomware stuff and so let's go into

562
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:14,220
the Wireshark decoder disk and you're

563
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,600
gonna know here that it has been

564
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,820
filtered here this is a display filter

565
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,220
on these request pages but what remember

566
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:23,460
wants is that user actually is going to

567
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,370
visit website all things British that

568
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:27,690
there's anybody in there

569
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:30,480
Victor so next okay I've never been to

570
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,190
here but to me it seems like something

571
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:34,950
that's which any of your question okay

572
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:37,530
so it seems like the legitimate website

573
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:39,660
this could compromise you know obviously

574
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,820
is fun for the mom and pop shop that we

575
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,910
can compromise so after they visit this

576
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:47,160
website that has been compromised it's

577
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,830
going to redirect them to this site

578
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:54,530
story got opinion on lines up our own

579
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:57,600
what's that are mobile me giving the

580

want to try to block these kinds of

615
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:26,710
debated if you can if you do that at the

616

here we go so this is what is the

620
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:37,960
injection script here and your lips I'm

621
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,760

laughing okay and you'll see here what's

623
00:24:42,669 --> 00:24:44,380
being used to a Decker scripted Avery's

624
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:49,570
Peter Thomas with the darkness book

625
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:52,419
right uh can we block that I mean you

626
00:24:52,419 --> 00:24:54,660
can block jobs 50 organizations

627
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,590
Connecticut block stripping in

628
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:57,940
organization okay

629
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,470
everybody find that really interesting

630
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:02,080
how he wound to all this active content

631
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,390
and all these scripts on on the on the

632
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:06,490
inner on the web because that's what

633
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:08,080
users want but really aren't being

634
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,910
introducing both of them ability to be

635
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:13,270
happening and you just mind one is what

636
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:16,179
make it up if we could were stripping

637
00:25:16,179 --> 00:25:18,880
around forever and what would be the

638
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,240
impact of that I don't wonder if I were

639
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,190
to I mean I had great Michael my users

640
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,500
change the password than she had for 20

641
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,890
years propagated they've got one of my

642
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:33,490
customers are serious work the policy

643
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,990
would not to change passwords and they

644
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:37,750
got now and I got a do this I don't care

645
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:38,559
what they think

646
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:41,049
and I really I thought up convicted

647
00:25:41,049 --> 00:25:43,540
people were finding me and I was coming

648
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,400
down the hall because I had that passion

649
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,160
for 20 user and I need to change and

650
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,780
really that the kind of reactions I

651
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,850
would actually step again someone I'm so

652
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,470
Kara done you're not going to get worked

653
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:55,030
on the websites designed to function

654
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:57,880
with that stuff okay and it appears

655
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,520
being redirected so it's been a URL to

656
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,049
description with this iPhone that's one

657
00:26:02,049 --> 00:26:04,800
student became landing page

658
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,680
things and then on this page here will

659
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,330
then take you this version of a vehicle

660
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:11,610
talked about I'm not asking parity now

661
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:14,160
we don't know what that little half you

662
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,200
know when I see stuff that doesn't make

663
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:16,680
sense

664
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:20,370
I think occupation but nobody really

665
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,680
determine that and then we've sent a

666
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,540
flash exploit vehicle of the other

667
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,490
things that need to be considered off

668
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:29,700
the side scripting and Java and then up

669
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,430
next the script here relaxing other

670
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:35,070
expertise actually export okay which is

671
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,720
not really encryption but in the form of

672
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,890
obfuscation that but okay yes I mean

673
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,660
here's to find a people diversion do

674
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:45,510
want to could you do confiscation to

675
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:47,370
protect against what any kind of

676
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:49,710
network-based intrusion detection team

677
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,150
that might be able detect it anything

678
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:53,670
locally under then after we've spent a

679
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:55,050
lot to download the download graph

680
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:59,160
locking itself and and what did the

681
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,660
trees blocking been decrees going to

682
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,130
have to be impossible for despot those

683
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:03,840
of that so now let's look at the next

684
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,420
side the top of the next site these two

685
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:09,390
types of particulars find abuse calm and

686
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:16,050
pro prepare calm but DNS queries for

687
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:18,150
laughing they're doing digital once

688
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:20,010
again in this filter it's doing the

689
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:22,590
queries for these URL like you see here

690
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:24,150
and you see in here

691
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:28,710
and then for find are less calm notice

692
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:31,400
it didn't work for chrome contain right

693
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,770
so guess what no response can't go this

694
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:36,930
will see it's going to try another son

695
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:39,540
so it's really because a pralaya having

696
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,980
many many compromised site to be able

697
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:45,000
gamble to subject so there's a query for

698
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,220
part idealist that returns this empty

699
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,920
address and it's from this site here by

700
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,470
desist calm that obviously could be own

701
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,840
zip economize that after the retrieval

702
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,440
of the downloads blocky

703
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,180
demography other queries for these funky

704
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:03,480
URL either call back the reins or right

705
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,950
to the cannon commands whole control

706
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:07,170
infrastructure is one of them work but

707
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:09,110
guess what you know Monica work is

708
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:13,460
business about what answer one okay so

709
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:18,330
notice in this example here this example

710
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:19,230
here

711
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,360
the files and support things were

712
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,149
encrypted they were given that OPI an

713
00:28:24,149 --> 00:28:25,889
extension and that's how they felt

714
00:28:25,889 --> 00:28:28,350
encrypted and that's why we call this

715
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:33,029
open version box box so you know as I've

716
00:28:33,029 --> 00:28:34,679
been doing this more MORE how do we

717
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:36,870
connect that with a great way of

718
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:38,730
protecting our self-describing pieces of

719
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:41,370
knowledge from DNS okay because you know

720
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:43,620
doing attacker is using domain names

721
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,539
they need to get resolved and I think

722
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:47,010
you need to be looking at you know

723
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:50,639
Sarafian s queries on to that protect

724
00:28:50,639 --> 00:28:53,309
your network so how are you gonna

725
00:28:53,309 --> 00:28:59,639
protect it is resize it all Osprey is in

726
00:28:59,639 --> 00:29:01,889
any matter I mean how many of you feel

727
00:29:01,889 --> 00:29:04,019
comfortable that they're doing a great

728
00:29:04,019 --> 00:29:04,350
job

729
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:07,500
second is now you know we look at

730
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,269
hosting solutions I know there's some

731
00:29:09,269 --> 00:29:10,649
bad system that are you know that

732
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:12,210
segregation is for someone

733
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:14,669
partly like a metal face delicious other

734
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:16,919
customers will get to like umbrella open

735
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:19,710
DN a-- f king dramatic improvements in

736
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:22,279
malware as a deafening dramatic filter

737
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:27,269
boxes elbows powerful just by not being

738
00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:36,840
English background uh I don't see how we

739
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,149
put there but it'll knock down with

740
00:29:39,149 --> 00:29:44,610
really real one here that's what I mean

741
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:49,320
you sort of infectious he has been here

742
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,750
in drastic end up it depends on how the

743
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:54,090
neck is being delivered or it depends

744
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:58,380
really a changeling PDF file who's going

745
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,440
to have to back yeah if there's an end

746
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:08,149
of the wizard fundamentalism okay so um

747
00:30:08,149 --> 00:30:12,059
so you know whether it be mostly system

748
00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:13,830
to be exploited in the custom for the

749
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:15,389
type of also is being exploited

750
00:30:15,389 --> 00:30:17,580
of the product versions that are being

751
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:20,789
targeted at patentability a piece of the

752
00:30:20,789 --> 00:30:22,559
necessary application techniques with

753
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,630
your eye on Scooby backer which worked

754
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:26,510
as well you know

755
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:30,570
levels of against them the quorum we

756
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:32,800
never feel really very Celtic

757
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,720
I mean a beautiful destination state

758
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,060
after other unique concerns and if

759
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:39,010
you're going to have to replace the 14

760
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:41,020
year old Japan you know might be able to

761
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,670
lessen Germans what they can save our

762
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:45,190
school gave up they have a situation and

763
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:47,230
amount of time required to build a

764
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,850
reliable okay so you know when we look

765
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:51,070
at our protection is this typical

766
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:54,160
despair and death stuff I mean really

767
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,440
and you know we have to make sure are we

768
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,600
doing this stuff well I have some

769
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,640
clients in our native have managed it

770
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,650
very well although I said wanted by I

771
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:04,660
was your field working 12 14 hour days

772
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:07,060
and if you are laptops or absorb more

773
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:10,060
passionately anti-virus you know we

774
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:12,190
don't look at the efficacy of empirical

775
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:13,660
signature based and devices but

776
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,670
concessional have aliens of our race and

777
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:18,100
have people say you're the second

778
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,050
decision in fact our reading article

779
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:22,660
which the biggest said you don't mean

780
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,130
the end in our percent just keep the

781
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:26,380
systems fully patched so babies I kind

782
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:28,240
of understood the logic on that because

783
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,100
well in the most catches some

784
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,660
low-hanging foods to contribute and

785
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,580
about you still need it in fact anymore

786
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:36,730
because of sex right you know I PS

787
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,530
functionality that's a host-based

788
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:41,520
firewall oh so they are working with the

789
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,230
entire web technologies is still kind of

790
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:47,170
early definitely on newest versions of

791
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:50,170
applications of the prominent in modern

792
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:51,970
environment we can't always run the

793
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:54,130
latest version of things because if we

794
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:56,920
do it British enterprise app is anybody

795
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,730
in that situation

796
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:59,620
yeah I know what I'm talking about yeah

797
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,210
I don't remember gets like everybody's

798
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:04,690
old versions of IP because you know we

799
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:06,820
can't upgrade even we're going to guess

800
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,490
what they can't get the hrf or the

801
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:11,080
Accounts Payable app is not gonna

802
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,630
function any more so you know I tend not

803
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:15,730
to beat up people who forgotten today's

804
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:17,650
round of applications because there's a

805
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:20,670
reality just use it as a reason for that

806
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:23,140
then I need to go home call idea about

807
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:26,140
walking software if you want see how

808
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,540
painful blocking software is under

809
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,470
scripting scripts

810
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:31,390
use no script plugin for Firefox

811
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:35,470
intended use that yeah use motion on

812
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:37,330
Firefox and having to block everything

813
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,340
and against be out April it should be

814
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,970
about two minutes to turn that

815
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:43,880
and a really find it interesting that

816
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,580
it's easy for browser I remember using

817
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,530
the tor browser will run strippers on by

818
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:50,750
default now I can download my squares at

819
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,430
or ecology he'll fit those with the same

820
00:32:52,430 --> 00:33:02,420
in both at the on time interesting okay

821
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,470
there you go

822
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:06,410
Oh Stephanie for uh you know happy

823
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:08,960
perimeter defenses and I said identical

824
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,320
reports

825
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,900
I really enjoyed BNSF jumpy another

826
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,930
identical it secreted service now you

827
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:17,180
know that we can prevent this stuff from

828
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,440
getting on your network in the first

829
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,590
place oh I'm a big proponent of

830
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:26,540
outsourcing well not because one event

831
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:29,600
job but I found that you know even if I

832
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,980
compute my homework there something I

833
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:34,040
want expertise on stuff so I want being

834
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:37,160
able to get a job to someone who does

835
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,380
that except in a 24/7 I think they can

836
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,360
do a better job than I can but a really

837
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,770
convinced that these services of other

838
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:45,440
you don't have dying and that's on there

839
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,600
they provide the service students when

840
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,430
they're not being DDOT unemployed botnet

841
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:52,250
or so I'm gonna happen but yeah I really

842
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:54,110
think that you get really the best night

843
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,670
we were talking protection when you look

844
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:57,410
at including security as a service as

845
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,360
fertilization and then end-user training

846
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:03,380
you know you know we report to training

847
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,300
all the time I spoke said to click on

848
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,230
things they shouldn't

849
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:08,900
I've done you here uh used to send me

850
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,699
pictures of stuff that they were

851
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:12,320
suspicious I think that's pretty cool

852
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,870
because you exactly the data today

853
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:16,699
pea-pickin will be posted vicious now

854
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:18,350
maybe a contractor is awesome pretty

855
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:20,000
quickly by just a photo

856
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,820
that's a SME one level a local art so

857
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:25,610
these things exploit kids are going to

858
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:27,679
grow on time are now they're going to

859
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,889
realize in require a less routine

860
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:33,139
relatively inexpensive often a financial

861
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:34,550
splinter I thought about that silly

862
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:36,380
Paula that's very appealing to the

863
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,540
distributor that surgical integrator

864
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:41,449
they're very flexible they can deliver

865
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:43,250
many different types of matter today

866
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,780
just happens to be man to market to that

867
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:47,300
easiest ways to monetize your investment

868
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:47,750
and yours

869
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:50,599
right but if you're in nation states I

870
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:52,639
don't see nations big great other than

871
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,010
North Korean licenses think they want to

872
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:57,590
finer things up what a crime to be

873
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:59,660
attributed to run through anybody's we

874
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:03,740
want o to interesting okay so yeah

875
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,660
apparently me who's the right action for

876
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,400
people article to deliver but it could

877
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,770
be almost anything a very good at

878
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:11,450
avoiding detection because they're using

879
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:13,250
the latest expert that you're claiming

880
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:17,000
constantly being updated and abundant if

881
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,940
you want to buy defies you can buy if

882
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:22,040
you want to read up as possible and come

883
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,960
with technical support and normalize it

884
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,180
just so many targets done okay you know

885
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:28,670
what Windows computers are still over

886
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:31,210
ninety something percent of the market

887
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:35,000
ranks or the club so we density eight

888
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,460
drops and export activity this year for

889
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,840
a couple reasons and we have some

890
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:42,260
arrests that went on but guess what

891
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,820
that just means that the guys who are

892
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:46,760
doing it to just laying low and just

893
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,980
laying low to the attention is turned to

894
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,720
something else and guess what they're

895
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,720
going to continue so I see here the

896
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,190
author's are kind of downside and gun

897
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:57,020
fever they're still doing some

898
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,910
development of surprise people people

899
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:00,920
that they hope you know that month you

900
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,359
know we're looking at the government its

901
00:36:02,359 --> 00:36:05,060
movie reputation based like to just it's

902
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:07,010
not going to make you design a polo

903
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:08,990
shirt that you have to get to know

904
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:11,450
someone so they found resources and

905
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:12,710
Department will do product development

906
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,300
with people they know they know

907
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:17,089
interstate and small and campaign and

908
00:36:17,089 --> 00:36:18,890
they're looking in other delivery

909
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:21,970
mechanisms like you doesn't be a macros

910
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:25,130
remember one is not o'clock how old is

911
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:26,810
that you're living an amazing that this

912
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:27,170
sucks

913
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:29,750
just keep sucking back so my prediction

914
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:31,480
is that we're going to continue to see

915
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,369
cyber crime using these tools for the

916
00:36:34,369 --> 00:36:35,359
foreseeable future

917
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,970
you know why internet global so I can

918
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:41,330
happen from you know Seoul Korea up in

919
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:44,089
Washington DC with the posted impunity

920
00:36:44,089 --> 00:36:46,010
if you notice an anonymity that goes

921
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:48,710
with that also the enemy provided by

922
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:53,150
crypto currencies okay um we thought

923
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,859
these mixers anybody have Bitcoin

924
00:36:54,859 --> 00:36:56,960
Bitcoin you stick one yet

925
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,380
oh yeah it's very difficult if you're

926
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,839
paying to be a Bitcoin so can we figure

927
00:37:02,839 --> 00:37:05,750
out who that person is on them up in

928
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:07,580
that world life because of the

929
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:10,220
development of mixing services and the

930
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,470
supply of these exploitable target and

931
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:15,950
that include up guy as anybody here ever

932
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:18,290
conservative then you're going to have

933
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:22,400
malware and we have malice and to shame

934
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,190
to existing internet because it should

935
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:27,859
be under percent guy yeah I do this do

936
00:37:27,859 --> 00:37:30,080
this for watching beyond the percent but

937
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,180
that includes us and one of the existing

938
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,609
could be an ass for so good I mean

939
00:37:34,609 --> 00:37:36,740
there's like us coming phishing email

940
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:39,200
that I want to go into that fmpp header

941
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,690
feels like networks real unsightly for

942
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:43,339
both in goes in essence Pierre

943
00:37:43,339 --> 00:37:45,290
I will notice that the first server is

944
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:47,150
the little phones an idiot would never

945
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:49,339
invent so I'm 10 months of playing

946
00:37:49,339 --> 00:37:51,140
people get effective it's not their

947
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,940
fault you know the attackers are very

948
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:56,720
clever optimal clever than just low

949
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,060
props probably will give a low conjuring

950
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:01,280
up Patrick and propagation we think

951
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,990
about this getting caught is erectus I

952
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:06,020
mean you know you can count us maybe one

953
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:09,339
hand in from the last couple years so

954
00:38:09,339 --> 00:38:13,460
pretty lucrative and as their continued

955
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:16,280
life of a bidding programs such as s

956
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,619
particular service and you're gonna bond

957
00:38:18,619 --> 00:38:20,359
is is one of money to be baby either

958
00:38:20,359 --> 00:38:21,770
going to be just make sure you out of

959
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:24,260
that with a lot of money and so gold is

960
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,089
a lot of money on is going to continue

961
00:38:26,089 --> 00:38:28,460
so looking over our continuing to adapt

962
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,980
like most bad guy to right I don't know

963
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,839
in law enforcement energy and work in

964
00:38:32,839 --> 00:38:33,880
law enforcement

965
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:37,730
no one would you know you have a typical

966
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:40,640
worker person the bad guy girl always I

967
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,920
had a law enforcement would you agree

968
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,900
and everything came from this bad guys

969
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,450
are always ahead of us we're always very

970
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,470
reactive

971
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:51,050
right I mean how often do we get to be

972
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:52,250
through a lot because that's one be

973
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:54,740
tools a hosting a I can help with that

974
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:56,540
and it's going to be very difficult to

975
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:58,310
please you know notice even when its

976
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:01,220
creators arrested the code is still out

977
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,170
there and will be be used

978
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:05,030
I mean had several infants history of

979
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:07,260
hope you read it one thing is whatever

980
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,690
displacement quarkxpress Stuxnet

981
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:13,140
classified malware right it is bad guys

982
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:16,910
out Holden actually tried to be deployed

983
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:27,540
two times any questions yes sir no but I

984
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:30,330
have thought it to be my wife Africa

985
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:31,950
types of people's living interested

986
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:34,680
interesting CEOs for Jamal so not me

987
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,810
right now but we've actually snapped out

988
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:38,700
