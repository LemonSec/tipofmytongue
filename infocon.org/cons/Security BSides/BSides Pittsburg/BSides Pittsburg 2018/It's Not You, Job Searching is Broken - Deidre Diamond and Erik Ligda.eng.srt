1
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:05,520
alright everybody let's get started

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,189
again welcome welcome you are in the

3
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:11,190
Gold Room and we have up on stage

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,920
daydream and Eric and whether you're

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,719
looking for a job or whether you

6
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:17,970
yourself are looking for job applicants

7
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,170
they're gonna talk to you about how you

8
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,330
can take back control of your job search

9
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,869
in a talk called it's not you your job

10
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:26,160
search is broken let's give them a nice

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:36,030
round of applause all over the u.s. from

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,190
somebody that's constantly being asked

13
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,649
about how to get into the field and how

14
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:42,270
do I get training and supportable

15
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,610
besides really answers that so those

16
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,430
that sponsor to us others you're awesome

17
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,100
because we have a problem not only do we

18
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,870
have a shortage problem yes it's true we

19
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,160
have a shortage we also have a

20
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,780
recruiting problem a job searching

21
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,210
problem and we have a retention problem

22
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,550
so this talk was inspired by Eric who is

23
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:05,369
our chief security architect at cyber

24
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:08,310
s/n and had spent years and years job

25
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,720
searching as a security professional

26
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,600
only to be horrified each year worse and

27
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,670
worse and then found us and was like

28
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,020
teacher we gotta we gotta get out there

29
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,159
and talk about this we've been together

30
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:19,409
two years he's learned a lot about the

31
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:21,180
business and was like I gotta help get

32
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,590
this out there so I'm the founder and

33
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,020
CEO of cyber SM I got into cyber

34
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,810
security in 2007 by asking to take my

35
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,820
sales model that I had built in staffing

36
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,130
recruiting for IT and software to build

37
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,500
rapid7 sales and so the founders I had

38
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,970
worked for in staffing owned rapid7

39
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,060
that's how I got into cyber I then went

40
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,110
became a CEO of one of our other

41
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:41,610
companies before I built this company

42
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,460
and it really stems from the love I'm a

43
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,049
social promote justice major my buddies

44
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:48,000
ended up being all cyber people and then

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,530
I started watching everybody just have

46
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,540
terrible search problems and I thought

47
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,579
oh my gosh I got a service industry so

48
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,770
that's where we were born I also founded

49
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,390
a few years ago a company called brain

50
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,159
baby org you can see it out there that

51
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:02,610
is a play to stop those fades and and

52
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,250
get the diversity problem solved and we

53
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,560
staff conferences with Steam students

54
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,729
doesn't matter what you're studying

55
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,830
you're interested in working RSA

56
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,260
blackhat what have you we RSA we stopped

57
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:13,890
this

58
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,689
so solving big problems so that's who we

59
00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:19,980
are and native lives here in the area my

60
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,720
mom's from Butler so I'm always happy to

61
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,879
be here we're a national firm doing

62
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,140
really cool stuff so what we want to

63
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,090
share with you is what is going on so

64
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,220
that you can empower yourself we're

65
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,260
gonna use stories of Eric's search a

66
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,689
little bit in later in this so that you

67
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:35,129
can see like how do you avoid that

68
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:36,629
because you probably have already had

69
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:38,189
that experience or you know somebody

70
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:40,739
that has and so we're really going to

71
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:41,819
show you first of all how it's broken

72
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:44,220
how agencies fit into this thing and

73
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,019
then what you need to do to take control

74
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:47,730
of your own search or if you're hiring

75
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:52,200
what you need to do to find the talent

76
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,159
because the statistics show that

77
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:56,849
eighty-nine percent of the cyber

78
00:02:56,849 --> 00:02:59,310
security marketplace will talk to a

79
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,290
recruiter doesn't mean they get to talk

80
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:02,430
to a recruiter doesn't mean if they do

81
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,510
talk to recruiter they know what the

82
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:04,859
hell they're talking about it just means

83
00:03:04,859 --> 00:03:06,810
that they they're not completely happy

84
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:10,290
where they work and most of that is due

85
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:14,400
to two things it is due to you know

86
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,379
their unhappiness is due to not taking

87
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:18,750
security seriously or people those are

88
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,849
the two things we hear so knowing that

89
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:22,620
89% of the marketplace would love to

90
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,849
work somewhere that gives them more

91
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:26,129
happiness and they can't find it it

92
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:27,629
really bothers me significantly

93
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:31,019
meanwhile like our dating apps all right

94
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:33,000
right like we figured it out I could go

95
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,829
on a date tonight in any city with

96
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:36,540
whatever profile I wanted to go on and

97
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,859
it would be fun and that's crazy that

98
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:39,209
you all can't find each other in that

99
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:41,970
same capacity it's nutty so we're

100
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,199
solving that we'll talk about that a

101
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:44,459
little bit at the end so let's look at

102
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,889
what's going on okay the digital era

103
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:49,949
started really truly about ten years ago

104
00:03:49,949 --> 00:03:52,709
in terms of really advertising and and

105
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:54,780
getting out of print and newspapers and

106
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,729
what-have-you and so one of the first

107
00:03:56,729 --> 00:03:57,989
things I noticed when I got back into

108
00:03:57,989 --> 00:03:59,639
staffing after leaving it ten years and

109
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:02,659
going into software was the whole SEO

110
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:06,510
content piece really skewed what's what

111
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,099
contents being given to you so for

112
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:10,290
instance meaning it's free now back in

113
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,900
the day before running an ad you would

114
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,540
never be pages long of a job description

115
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,789
ever because we would pay five thousand

116
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:19,889
dollars to put a paragraph in the New

117
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:21,510
York Times LA Times Fawcett right over

118
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,240
it was on a Sunday and that's your one

119
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,190
shot and that was your one entry point

120
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,450
into finding people

121
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:28,530
getting four jobs and you better know

122
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:29,850
how to write your content it better make

123
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:30,810
sense and you better speak their

124
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:33,180
language well today it's free you can do

125
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,030
pages and you got to deal with SEO which

126
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,770
means you got to put keyword searches in

127
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,650
your write in your resume and your job

128
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,320
descriptions 10-15 times each keyword so

129
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,840
of course you're all working everybody's

130
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,760
working who's got time to job search

131
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,730
this makes it incredibly incredibly hard

132
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,590
so this is the number one problem I'm

133
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,150
sure all of you now at this point those

134
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,380
of you that are a little bit seasons

135
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,540
have experienced that you can read an ad

136
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,030
and you know whether or not they know

137
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,800
what they're doing in their security

138
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,260
practice right or if they're just

139
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,240
cutting and pasting somebody's ad which

140
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,670
is typically what most people are doing

141
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,290
so this is a major problem it's the

142
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,910
number one thing we do when we come into

143
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,010
serve as a client is sit down and really

144
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,270
understand what are the tasks what are

145
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,680
the projects what percentage of their

146
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,030
time are they working on that and so

147
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,220
this is a big big piece why the

148
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,320
marketplace is so messed up everybody's

149
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,640
just working on keywords and if you're

150
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,980
in fiber it's not like software and IT

151
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,750
this is not a business of technology

152
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,250
it's a business of safety and security

153
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,530
and yes there's some tech involved lots

154
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,120
of tech don't get me wrong but it's not

155
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,820
about being a technology and so there's

156
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,610
35 job categories 150 different titles

157
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:41,220
adding to it every day seven different

158
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,380
profiles of a security engineer that

159
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,960
doesn't happen in IT right so this is

160
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,540
very very complicated and we need to

161
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:51,810
start words matter and we've given words

162
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,480
to not matter now and this is a big big

163
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,200
piece of this

164
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,700
so am I qualified am I not if you're a

165
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,070
woman we've all tested we know that

166
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,660
women don't respond to ads unless they

167
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,070
know a hundred percent they can do the

168
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,110
job now whether or not we can we're

169
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,640
gonna change that but that's the way it

170
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,030
is so think about what has happened to

171
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,770
all these different results and just

172
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,860
having this bad content so this is one

173
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,320
reason why job searching is broken right

174
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,930
contents bad and if we've got bad

175
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,670
content and you're all working how do

176
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,230
you have time you don't want to talk to

177
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,000
people that you don't have the job for

178
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,070
you so it's a big mess all right so this

179
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,500
is a big piece of it here's the other

180
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,200
piece of it so my goodness well you know

181
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,060
we get through all of that we come in we

182
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,470
figure out what we're looking for we can

183
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,930
identify the talent get them in front of

184
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,030
it no problem we'll pay whatever and the

185
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,770
reality is they won't pay whatever

186
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,870
their salary bands have to be changed

187
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,580
and now we're waiting on offers three or

188
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,229
four weeks and we're losing candidates I

189
00:06:46,229 --> 00:06:47,460
see a lot of heads nodding it's

190
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,759
maddening so this is a big piece of why

191
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:52,740
job searching so broken right now is

192
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,150
that people don't have correct salary

193
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,639
data or they want to put cyber people in

194
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,169
IT you know categories which as of this

195
00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:03,270
last year the salaries have raised 25

196
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,729
percent over IT it used to be 15 it's

197
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:08,669
now 25 percent so trying to do that

198
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:10,740
doesn't work and so we get you even when

199
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,759
they find people they're not able to

200
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,650
onboard them because of these salary

201
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,389
challenges and getting signatures and so

202
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:17,639
this is a bit of a mess and we'll talk

203
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:19,080
about this at the end in terms of how do

204
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,550
you talk if you're in you know looking

205
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,720
for a job how do you talk about money

206
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,599
what did the equal pay do to job

207
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:26,960
searching which has already been

208
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,330
institutionalized in Pennsylvania so

209
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:31,620
what is that all about we'll talk about

210
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,409
that at the end that's a big piece

211
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:35,969
internal hiring practices most companies

212
00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:39,150
they're pretty archaic the real sad part

213
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,830
about this is that we force internal

214
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,449
recruiters to speak cyber and they can't

215
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:44,159
it's not gonna happen you can't speak

216
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:46,620
every language there is you can't it's

217
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,030
just not possible I had to build

218
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,460
products for my you know staffing

219
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,590
specialist to interview from and take

220
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,569
job orders from so there's just no way

221
00:07:54,569 --> 00:07:57,509
you can put that burden but we do and

222
00:07:57,509 --> 00:07:59,880
the other problem I see here which is

223
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,000
pretty mind-blowing is that there aren't

224
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,759
staffing agency budgets that HR is

225
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,889
willing to give to cyber but they give

226
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:09,900
it to IT and software all day long it's

227
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,330
SuperDuper strange I'm still seeking to

228
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,669
figure this one out so in the meantime

229
00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:16,409
I've been telling everybody put it in

230
00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:19,169
your own budgets put your you know

231
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:21,389
staffing budget in your own budget don't

232
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:23,849
rely on HR there's no way you can staff

233
00:08:23,849 --> 00:08:25,319
your teams without a specialized

234
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:27,090
staffing partner it's just not gonna

235
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,969
then most cyber professionals aren't on

236
00:08:29,969 --> 00:08:31,979
LinkedIn and even if they are they're

237
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:33,360
just not interested in talking to

238
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,000
everybody who doesn't speak cycle so

239
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,130
it's really hard and then on top of that

240
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:40,529
just you know internal practices of like

241
00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:42,539
giving tests and all these things that

242
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:44,219
just get in your way that make no sense

243
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:49,230
so it's a it's pretty bleak and then

244
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,360
like I said the delayed it's on average

245
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,370
I did a research study on average people

246
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,270
wait six months before they

247
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,730
come to me six months meanwhile we can

248
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,650
fill it in 30 days with somebody that's

249
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,060
really gonna be happy to be there

250
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,520
a we've got the reach but be it's

251
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,350
because people aren't generally in love

252
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,640
with their company and I can choose my

253
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,590
clients and find good stuff but you know

254
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,930
so anyhow at the end of the day it's uh

255
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:12,900
it's pretty hard to you know it's

256
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,370
impossible unless you speak the language

257
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:17,280
all right so I'm gonna transition over

258
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,780
to Eric in a minute here but this purple

259
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,490
unicorn I mean how many of us have heard

260
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,160
in the cyber space like oh I'm a unicorn

261
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,530
or I want a unicorn right like that's

262
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,300
like the common thing a purple unicorn

263
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,070
or you know I'm looking for a purple

264
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,860
unicorn for a long time I used to think

265
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,720
oh that's so cute you know like meaning

266
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,460
that we all think of ourselves as rare

267
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,500
and we are rare and then I realized well

268
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,520
what that means is people are doing

269
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:42,090
three jobs and get purple unicorns don't

270
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,500
want to be purple unicorns anymore I

271
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,000
started you know the purple unicorns are

272
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,470
like hey can I get some help over here

273
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,870
and can we hire people and and so now

274
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,280
I'm like hate telling everybody to stop

275
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,860
thinking it's a good thing that you want

276
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,390
a purple unicorn because purple unicorns

277
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,620
don't want to be purple unicorns they

278
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,600
don't want to do three jobs and they

279
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,720
want teammates so but this is a syndrome

280
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,640
that we see that people because the

281
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,330
budgets are so under-budgeted cyber has

282
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:09,060
come hot and fast and CEOs and the cost

283
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,580
has come hot and fast and it's hard to

284
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,740
get that money and so they've made it

285
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,210
such that people are doing three jobs

286
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:18,900
and it's a disaster actually so I say

287
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,550
let's not make this so cute anymore and

288
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,810
let's recognize what we're saying when

289
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,730
we when we feel good about being purple

290
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:26,430
unicorn I you don't want to be

291
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:29,130
pigeonholed into three jobs forever so

292
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,960
on that note I'm gonna pass over to

293
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,410
another purple unicorn it takes to share

294
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,360
his experience and what-what happened to

295
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,710
him when he was job searching and then

296
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,270
I'm going to tell you all how to avoid

297
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:45,140
that it's a very common stuff yeah

298
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,400
joining Cypress and I worked as a

299
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,620
security architect at a defense

300
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,870
contractor mid Johnson Pennsylvania and

301
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:54,930
I went through the whole game of growing

302
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:57,360
my career so a tiny sans classes and

303
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,260
getting gr certifications SCS SP

304
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:03,150
learning continuing to volcana keep off

305
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:06,300
technology and so great company can

306
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,360
learn a lot I love that place

307
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,610
things change and careers want to evolve

308
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,170
so I started looking and I thought oh

309
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:15,020
great cyber is hot industry with all my

310
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,640
certifications and my experience it's me

311
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,550
no-brainer right create a resume launch

312
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:22,550
it sir again calls from recruiters hi

313
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,180
every time

314
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,530
hey what do you do what are you looking

315
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:27,230
for same pitch same spill never once

316
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,670
that I get the feeling that they're

317
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,620
critically understood what I was saying

318
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,690
so I was trying to explain to them what

319
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:35,090
is packet capture what is an IDs how do

320
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:36,890
you manage a firewall and through the

321
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:39,230
process I was like man's frustrating

322
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:42,350
right so what I did is I reluctantly

323
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:44,840
went on some job interviews that I quasi

324
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,050
interest in but you know want to see

325
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:50,480
more and interesting things happen I'm

326
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,130
gonna share a few stories with you what

327
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:56,290

you weren't a cultural fit like whoa did

343
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,800
I say something wrong like what happened

344
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,010
like you wore a suit to the interview

345
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:38,810
what you wore a suit to interview I'm

346
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:41,360
like what was this most the where well

347
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,730
we're more relaxed culture so you're

348
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,500
coming from a defense contracting your

349
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,030
worth suit more and more of a t-shirt

350
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,350
and jeans tight place so we're gonna

351
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:53,920
pass on you okay

352
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,110

353
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:01,010
on a recruiter call me and said I see

354
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:02,660
you have a lot of different firewalls on

355
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:05,000
your background do you happen to know

356
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,180
Palo Alto make sure I use it small cases

357
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,190
but I don't know anything big time

358
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,920
none of the layer 7 application layer

359
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,500
stuff but I can work my way through it a

360
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,370

you tell me this and you're like no no

386
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,970
this is how we get you in a door so at

387
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:13,579
this point I'm I'm just over it over it

388
00:14:13,579 --> 00:14:16,730
right I go to our saying and I sat down

389
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,589
next to daydream and I just wanted to

390
00:14:18,589 --> 00:14:20,750
drink one of the cocktail and she's

391
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,130
sitting next to me I'm like oh hey what

392
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,240
do you do it she's like I'm a recruiter

393
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:28,160
like and she's like why and I start

394
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,839
explaining this right and grant up a few

395
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,880
drinks in and so we developed this

396
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,970
relationship from my misery and from

397
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,440
there she tells me it's not always like

398
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,810
that and after joining cyber SN and

399
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:40,310
realizing it there's a lot of things to

400
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:43,120
go behind the scenes in recruiting and

401
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,950
HR just as a systemic problem and it

402
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:48,110
wasn't just me it this is out there so

403
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:50,360
what we want to do is from this store is

404
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,029
what did we learn from it and also what

405
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:55,190
we arm you guys with as you search for

406
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:58,579
your next stage so based upon my yes

407
00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:01,190
really just to shed some more light on

408
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:03,199
our teach security officers in the room

409
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,480
he literally got up after about five

410
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,889
minutes of he's like says

411
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:09,879
his CSO like why don't you talk to her I

412
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:13,609
saw it go down do is hysterical but

413
00:15:13,609 --> 00:15:15,829
again I get it I know most recruiters

414
00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:18,439
are terrible and I also didn't introduce

415
00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:19,730
who I really was I just said recruit of

416
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:22,639
it anyhow so so let's talk about this

417
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,100
the his clothing so what I what what do

418
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,239
I want to do I want to tell you take

419
00:15:26,239 --> 00:15:27,919
your own job search in your own hands if

420
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:29,959
you were going through my firm we would

421
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:31,609
say to the to the client what do you

422
00:15:31,609 --> 00:15:34,100
want them to wear and we would tell you

423
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,559
so if you don't have that support you

424
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:39,379
need to ask and it's not to say that you

425
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:40,970
know maybe he wouldn't have never wanted

426
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:41,929
to work in a place like that because

427
00:15:41,929 --> 00:15:44,480
that's pretty messed up of a way to deal

428
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,699
with people and yet give yourself the

429
00:15:46,699 --> 00:15:49,189
opportunity to say no to them versus

430
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:51,259
them say no to you and maybe it's just

431
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:53,689
one person that blew it from that

432
00:15:53,689 --> 00:15:55,970
perspective and you know why put your

433
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,549
destiny in the hands of one person that

434
00:15:58,549 --> 00:16:00,769
may or may not be in this firm or even

435
00:16:00,769 --> 00:16:02,569
important in this firm to your success

436
00:16:02,569 --> 00:16:04,549
in the firm so the idea is empower

437
00:16:04,549 --> 00:16:07,730
yourselves ask ask whoever is setting

438
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,290
you up on the interview what should I

439
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:12,529
bear we call it prep and package in our

440
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:14,239
organization like did you prep and

441
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:17,029
package that person so not only what to

442
00:16:17,029 --> 00:16:19,129
wear who you know are there tricks to

443
00:16:19,129 --> 00:16:20,389
getting in the building there's nothing

444
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:22,759
worse than like not finding the building

445
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:24,439
interest feeling like you might be late

446
00:16:24,439 --> 00:16:25,910
rushing like you're not gonna kick it

447
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,679
off right so things like tricks to

448
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:28,970
getting into the building who's gonna

449
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:31,610
greet me who do I ask for like take that

450
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:34,369
into your own hands so that you don't

451
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:36,139
have any of these problems when you show

452
00:16:36,139 --> 00:16:39,829
up right the the resume piece we'll talk

453
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:40,970
about in a minute when we talk about how

454
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,319
to manage your recruiters if you're

455
00:16:42,319 --> 00:16:43,639
working with recruiters and the

456
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:45,499
agreements that you make up front let's

457
00:16:45,499 --> 00:16:47,959
talk about them in a minute so so ask

458
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:49,699
all the prep questions Who am I meeting

459
00:16:49,699 --> 00:16:51,799
for get let's get their first and last

460
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:54,350
name do their look them up on LinkedIn

461
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:56,419
ask questions about them any particular

462
00:16:56,419 --> 00:16:58,699
style that they interview with do they

463
00:16:58,699 --> 00:17:00,919
give tasks how long do you expect

464
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,869
they'll be with each person these are

465
00:17:02,869 --> 00:17:05,000
all things again we would do so that you

466
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,919
show up feeling like you know what's

467
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:09,529
gonna happen so do it for yourself right

468
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,689
ask questions about them is there gonna

469
00:17:11,689 --> 00:17:15,500
be a test right the getting in the dress

470
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,019
code and then like I said test so I do

471
00:17:18,019 --> 00:17:20,670
this so they don't think that on here is

472
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,589
it's important to be interested and

473
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:24,390
interesting and every conversation so

474
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,520
the more prep you do before you show up

475
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,680
shows you're taking a really great

476
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,210
interest in the job you're going after

477
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:31,440
so even before you walk in that door

478
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,480
you're more qualified than the other

479
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,070
candidates going in because you did your

480
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,420
homework you're really interested in

481
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,230
you're not just going through the

482
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:39,360
motions because even though you're in

483
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,800
your female from all places they're

484
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,660
interviewing multiple candidates you

485
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,510
want to set yourself apart yeah yeah I

486
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,070
didn't see that but the video there's a

487
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,900
lot of video interviews test it can tell

488
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,670
you how many times that goes awry and

489
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,410
then people are nervous and sweating and

490
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,090
it just takes away from it being great

491
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:56,420
the whole being interested interested

492
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,550
thing is like again you decide if you

493
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,660
want to work at the company

494
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,790
don't let them decide so if you come

495
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,220
with your game every time even if you're

496
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,950
not sure you want the job you'll have a

497
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,900
chance to see if you want the job

498
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,700
because you'll stay in the game of the

499
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,140
interviewing process you'll get to the

500
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,090
end and if you don't you don't but at

501
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:17,160
least give yourself the chance so being

502
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,930
prepared being interested asking good

503
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:21,840
questions I'll get you in the position

504
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,540
to make that final decision of do you

505
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:27,990
want to work there there is no question

506
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:29,730
that people are looking for you all even

507
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:32,340
though it doesn't feel that way it's

508
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,000
really about weeding through the noise

509
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,140
okay so your your recruiters so so I'm

510
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,460
gonna tell you in a minute about the

511
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,390
recruiting you want to do that first

512
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:43,800
yeah let's go back and let's tell

513
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,120
Stephanie and sure to do that let's do

514
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,030
that okay it's gonna freak you out let's

515
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:50,130
just do it a lot of it freaked me out

516
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,810
the second time around and I learned

517
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:54,540
some stuff like most staffing agencies

518
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,520
don't share candidates never knew that

519
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,650
my 13 years in staffing we were a group

520
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,720
we'd share across continents it didn't

521
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,850
matter but in most staffing agencies I

522
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,670
learned that do I bring you in and I'm

523
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:07,860
the recruiter that brings you in you you

524
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,300
don't get to see other jobs that my

525
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,900
fellow recruiters have what it's

526
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,750
mind-blowing to me so now what happens

527
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,880
in your life is dictated because of my

528
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,690
commission check

529
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,450
are you seriously freaky-deaky as I call

530
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:23,670
it so which is one of the reasons why

531
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,380
I'm a platform to transform a job

532
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,360
searching it is ridiculous it's almost

533
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,930
like it stupid human capital beyond

534
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:33,260
human capital its ownership of humans

535
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,720
disgusting so when you go work with an

536
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,270
agency you ask them do you share

537
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:40,250
candidates and if they don't do not

538
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,420
participate

539
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,400
that is ridiculous do not participate

540
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,310
force them to have good hygiene as

541
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,740
humans so what this means is even though

542
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,730
you're working with one recruiting

543
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,190
agency that recruiter may not share you

544
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,690
unless they're colleagues so yeah it's

545
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:56,420
very silent yeah yeah yes on purpose

546
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,340
because quote that's their Commission

547
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,630
check super gross

548
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:03,110
okay so there's contingency and search

549
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:05,630
firms and retain search firms retain

550
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,550
traditionally has only been for

551
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:10,310
executive staffing c-level staffing

552
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,890
which means if it's retained they're

553
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:14,270
gonna put some money up front they're

554
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,890
gonna pay you up front they'll pay you a

555
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,690
third upfront a third and thirty days

556
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,070
and then a third when the candidate

557
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:21,980
starts that's traditionally only been

558
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:25,130
executive contingency is where the bulk

559
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:27,590
of staffing is and contingency means the

560
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,900
staffing agency does not make a penny

561
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,090
until you've been at the org ninety days

562
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:35,780
like find you get you there you need to

563
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,210
be there ninety days okay so what do you

564
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:41,210
think that breeds like who works for

565
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:43,340
free other than people they're just

566
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,350
trying to wheel and deal in life in our

567
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,680
life situations it's nutty

568
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,290
absolutely nutty and I never I was

569
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:53,390
always contingency for all my years but

570
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:55,550
because we should worked in groups and

571
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,870
stuff you'd walk in and I can show you

572
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:59,750
ten opportunities in two days so you

573
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,820
know as a team so we didn't care we were

574
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,910
you know sharing and working together

575
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:06,800
but you put contingency on top of an on

576
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,260
shared model it's even worse right I my

577
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,170
business today is forty five percent in

578
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:14,690
retained engaged even though our

579
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,970
specialty is engineering practitioners

580
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:18,830
red team blue team doesn't matter I our

581
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:21,110
threat that that's our our bulk of our

582
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,850
business I'm not touching it unless

583
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,350
you're putting skin in the game not with

584
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,670
the problems that we've gotten cyber

585
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:27,890
today and well I can go deep in my

586
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,420
conspiracy theories of whether people

587
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,030
really want to fill jobs or not I would

588
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:35,450
talk about that another time so so so

589
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:37,460
understand that the way that the

590
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,860
industry works is it there's no license

591
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:42,230
you don't have to have any training and

592
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:43,370
then you get a bunch of people on the

593
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:45,740
phones working for just the Commission

594
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,909
check make nothing unless

595
00:21:46,909 --> 00:21:50,239
it happens it's uh it's a silly cheating

596
00:21:50,239 --> 00:21:51,649
one of the eye-opening experiences me

597
00:21:51,649 --> 00:21:53,679
was whenever I was interviewing the one

598
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,690
was a recruiter in town here he's like

599
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,489
hey I don't understand cyber which is

600
00:21:58,489 --> 00:22:00,799
awesome like so he was very aware of it

601
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,479
and very forthcoming and I'm like oh

602
00:22:02,479 --> 00:22:03,769
cool how long you been his new staff

603
00:22:03,769 --> 00:22:05,690
he's like dude six months just months

604
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:07,070
ago I was working at an hour primarily

605
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:10,549
car okay so how are you qualified to

606
00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:13,340
represent me to a company right and what

607
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,869
I learned is there's no license you

608
00:22:14,869 --> 00:22:16,580
don't have to go take an exam or get a

609
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,859
degree in recruiting you show up and

610
00:22:18,859 --> 00:22:20,929
here you go right how does that person

611
00:22:20,929 --> 00:22:22,369
gonna represent you and your career

612
00:22:22,369 --> 00:22:23,450
because we're all professionals here we

613
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:25,669
all are going places right you want that

614
00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:27,409
person to be your agent and really know

615
00:22:27,409 --> 00:22:31,789
what you're doing yeah super weird so

616
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:33,649
the other problem that you may or may

617
00:22:33,649 --> 00:22:35,119
not if your hiring manager you probably

618
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:37,039
do know but the relationship between

619
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,919
agencies and external agencies and

620
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,899
internal staffing departments is forward

621
00:22:41,899 --> 00:22:43,879
I mean in fact the platform that I'm

622
00:22:43,879 --> 00:22:45,109
building hit me in the second week

623
00:22:45,109 --> 00:22:46,489
because we were talking to a fortune 100

624
00:22:46,489 --> 00:22:48,320
that was yelling at second week of

625
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,759
business already got my website up we

626
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:51,649
already got an offer from a big company

627
00:22:51,649 --> 00:22:53,119
that you would know that was breached

628
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:55,099
for a security engineer and this HR

629
00:22:55,099 --> 00:22:56,570
person is ripping our heads off and it's

630
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:57,979
like you know what I left this entry ten

631
00:22:57,979 --> 00:22:59,450
years ago I forgot about these people I

632
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:02,149
have to get out of this I can't do this

633
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:04,279
I need to empower them or somehow

634
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:05,419
empower the managers there's this

635
00:23:05,419 --> 00:23:07,789
three-pronged inside out that's terrible

636
00:23:07,789 --> 00:23:09,409
we're fighting over budgets right so

637
00:23:09,409 --> 00:23:11,059
we're brought in but meanwhile we're

638
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:12,379
taking their budgets that's why I'm like

639
00:23:12,379 --> 00:23:13,820
put it in your own budget get out of

640
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,109
this you do it for software and

641
00:23:15,109 --> 00:23:17,749
technology all day long get out of that

642
00:23:17,749 --> 00:23:19,759
it's ugly ugly ugly it's I hate it

643
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:21,259
we work our best to make that not happen

644
00:23:21,259 --> 00:23:22,970
oh we've got to be really good at

645
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:25,159
communication cuz it's hard yeah what we

646
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:27,379
do is we go I wanna we go and talk to

647
00:23:27,379 --> 00:23:28,669
our manager directly so we want to know

648
00:23:28,669 --> 00:23:30,349
exactly what you're gonna do and then

649
00:23:30,349 --> 00:23:31,460
we're gonna find the best candidate for

650
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,349
you yeah we're not gonna work we're not

651
00:23:33,349 --> 00:23:34,580
gonna work a job we're not talking to

652
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,470
the hiring manager and so that's like oh

653
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,669
well you can't talk to our hiring missus

654
00:23:37,669 --> 00:23:41,210
wait what are you talking about so so

655
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:43,609
that world is pretty crazy and bizarre

656
00:23:43,609 --> 00:23:46,029
and so the other thing is if you are

657
00:23:46,029 --> 00:23:48,979
submit your resume and a recruiter

658
00:23:48,979 --> 00:23:51,049
submits your resume or to recruiters so

659
00:23:51,049 --> 00:23:53,899
symmetry resume you're out so we'll talk

660
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:55,460
about it with managing your recruiters

661
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,289
here in a minute but that you gotta you

662
00:23:57,289 --> 00:23:59,089
got to understand those referrals and so

663
00:23:59,089 --> 00:24:00,750
every time an agency's three four

664
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:03,050
a candidate you get six months to a year

665
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:05,940
ownership of that which means if they

666
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,680
hire you and anytime in the next six

667
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,860
months or a year the agency gets paid so

668
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,830
you get a double referral they're not

669
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,990
going to touch it which is why and let's

670
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,340
just move on to that in terms of

671
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,940
managing your recruiters again you have

672
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,320
measurable agreements one agreement is

673
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,210
they do not alter your resume whatsoever

674
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:26,550
and you make that clear I'm gonna work

675
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,050
with you don't get to alter my resume

676
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,820
I'm gonna work with you you do not

677
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:32,550
submit my resume unless you ask me first

678
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:34,980
right so if you all take control your

679
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,450
search write down everywhere you sent

680
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:38,220
your resume anywhere that anybody's talk

681
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,770
to you about a job you document it all

682
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,270
somebody calls you with an opportunity

683
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:44,160
you can check your work make sure you

684
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,540
haven't been submitted maybe somebody

685
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,790
else called you about the same job you

686
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,770
want to be clear and who's done what and

687
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:51,420
figure it out you do not want a double

688
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:54,030
referral so in my firm if anybody ever

689
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,710
sent out somebody's resume without

690
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,390
confirming with that person it would be

691
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:59,190
grounds for termination that is terrible

692
00:24:59,190 --> 00:24:59,700
again

693
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,610
we will not be causing problems we need

694
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:06,600
to be solving problems so however a lot

695
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,340
of agencies use resumes to quote open

696
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,290
doors to try and get in the account

697
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:12,870
right got your resume you're a hot cyber

698
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:16,170
person let me try and get in here so you

699
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:18,060
have to make the agreement with them

700
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,160
upfront they're not gonna make it with

701
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,860
you like we do and sometimes what

702
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,240
happens is these larger organizations

703
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,730
you may go and fly for one job but then

704
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,200
another job pops up three months later

705
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,030
you want apply to that and sometimes

706
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:32,520
you're never called back for that job

707
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,540
and it's nothing because you're not

708
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,670
qualified it's because you were locked

709
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:39,990
in on this particular department that

710
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:42,180
they're not sharing you over there and

711
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,320
there's no way you could get ahold of it

712
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,690
yeah the only good part is if you have a

713
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:47,700
good recruiter they can put a call and

714
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,140
push it through is like why is this

715
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:49,890
can't get ignored

716
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:51,570
what are you doing this can is periphery

717
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:53,220
you have to move on or else he's gonna

718
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,840
get picked or he or she it's gonna

719
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,000
picked up by another company so move

720
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,820
yeah I mean you're a recruiter ought to

721
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:03,060
be your advocate your agent I honestly

722
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,260
don't know how people get hired without

723
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:07,790
us it's fascinating I'm starting a live

724
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:10,290
greenroom situation where I get to share

725
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:12,750
stories because I'm listening constantly

726
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,700
I love understanding what's going on

727
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,679
and it's pretty mind-blowing types of

728
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:18,629
things that we have to do yeah let's

729
00:26:18,629 --> 00:26:22,950
talk about why I recruited yeah so this

730
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:25,980
is a trip right so my entire career I

731
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,899
was trained and you know and how

732
00:26:27,899 --> 00:26:29,639
everybody used to handle money is what

733
00:26:29,639 --> 00:26:31,230
what are you making today

734
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:33,629
yeah that's what everybody started with

735
00:26:33,629 --> 00:26:35,850
what are you making today and that

736
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:38,039
always tended to be just salary like

737
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:39,809
nobody looked at total copic which is

738
00:26:39,809 --> 00:26:41,429
salary what are you making today and so

739
00:26:41,429 --> 00:26:42,779
what we would tell everybody is look

740
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:45,090
when you get asked question make sure

741
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,559
that you talk about the whole package do

742
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,059
not just answer the question with your

743
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:49,739
salary because you may have more

744
00:26:49,739 --> 00:26:51,210
vacation you may have a different higher

745
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,889
bonus you may have thought you think

746
00:26:52,889 --> 00:26:54,779
that you got to get it all out there car

747
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,909
phone whatever it is cars the old days

748
00:26:56,909 --> 00:27:03,090
huh so that was old school and so when

749
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:04,200
you get asked the questions we'd say

750
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,940
give them everything tell them

751
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,539
everything well here we are

752
00:27:08,539 --> 00:27:10,889
2018 and we now have the Equal Pay Act

753
00:27:10,889 --> 00:27:12,720
does anybody raise your hand if you know

754
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,749
what the Equal Pay Act is Wow okay so

755
00:27:15,749 --> 00:27:18,299
we've got like 10% in here that or maybe

756
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:21,720
15 okay so the Equal Pay Act came to be

757
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,659
because to help women and minorities

758
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:27,059
make the same income as other

759
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:29,129
professionals and so the idea was that

760
00:27:29,129 --> 00:27:31,559
women don't negotiate and they're

761
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:32,940
traditionally taken advantage of because

762
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,350
they're a woman from the perspective of

763
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,149
money and so they start out lower and

764
00:27:36,149 --> 00:27:37,559
then they never catch up even though

765
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:39,299
they're in high-ranking positions

766
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:40,590
they're still making less than their

767
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:43,139
male peers and so what went into

768
00:27:43,139 --> 00:27:44,909
Congress years ago was solving that

769
00:27:44,909 --> 00:27:46,320
what's the Equal Pay Act well it finally

770
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,700
hit this year it's taken a couple of

771
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,009
years to get into play and one of the

772
00:27:50,009 --> 00:27:51,720
most interesting things about this and

773
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,830
I'll tell you how to handle it but the

774
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:56,340
quick that the law says I can I ring

775
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,720
organization it doesn't matter what

776
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,539
position you hold I can't ask you what

777
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:03,600
your base salary is I'm not legally

778
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,210
allowed to ask you anymore and so that's

779
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:08,519
supposed to stop basing the offer on

780
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:10,409
what you are last making and base the

781
00:28:10,409 --> 00:28:11,909
offer on industry standards and what

782
00:28:11,909 --> 00:28:13,379
other people in the company are making

783
00:28:13,379 --> 00:28:16,320
and it's working it so works all story

784
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,509
oh my gosh and it's just happened this

785
00:28:18,509 --> 00:28:20,429
year but in we do every time we place

786
00:28:20,429 --> 00:28:21,749
somebody in the organization there's a

787
00:28:21,749 --> 00:28:23,759
mail that goes out of the story and what

788
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:26,639
have you and we all the stories are

789
00:28:26,639 --> 00:28:28,549
including $50,000 raised

790
00:28:28,549 --> 00:28:31,830
$60,000 raised no joke because they have

791
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:33,570
they're just going by what everybody's

792
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:35,010
making in the company and what the

793
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:36,809
industry nobody gets asking the question

794
00:28:36,809 --> 00:28:38,700
any more it's fascinating and guess what

795
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,830
they're men so for those of us that

796
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:42,960
thought that we were you know women are

797
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,130
gonna get special treatment or whatever

798
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:46,590
it was always some you know people

799
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,450
getting upset about that law I'm not

800
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:49,830
here to tell you all its benefiting

801
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:52,409
everybody it's benefiting everybody it's

802
00:28:52,409 --> 00:28:55,320
super cool so so they may not ask you

803
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,929
you can decide to divulge it it's not of

804
00:28:57,929 --> 00:29:00,330
course you legally can tell anybody what

805
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:02,070
you're making it's just that they can't

806
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:05,460
ask so you know what ends up happening

807
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,230
now is people are gonna ask you what you

808
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:07,970
want

809
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:10,830
yeah and they definitely have you know

810
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,390
what do you want what's it gonna take to

811
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:15,000
get you it's a really being put in your

812
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,240
court and I'll tell you what I said back

813
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,919
in the you know before the law and I

814
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,539
still believe it today don't quote a

815
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:24,450
number because whatever you quote is

816
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:26,190
either what you're gonna get and you

817
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:27,539
could have gotten more and you left some

818
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:30,419
money on the table or it's too low and

819
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:32,309
use me too high and you priced yourself

820
00:29:32,309 --> 00:29:34,679
out of the job and you would have taken

821
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:36,809
it for less but you were playing what

822
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:37,799
you thought maybe was the negotiation

823
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:40,320
game or whatever and nobody wants to

824
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,970
hire somebody thinking oh well they

825
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:43,289
think I'm paying them less than they're

826
00:29:43,289 --> 00:29:45,120
worth or they want so it really could

827
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,150
mess up the deal for you so instead you

828
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:49,740
say you know what I'm all about the

829
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:53,010
total package which is the job the

830
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:55,620
opportunity itself the people the entire

831
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,419
package of what else you have

832
00:29:57,419 --> 00:30:00,030
beyond the salary I want to know

833
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:02,280
everything and really until I have all

834
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,900
that information I couldn't tell you

835
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:07,200
what I'd take as the base salary what

836
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,330
did you have in mind you know start

837
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:10,919
picking their brain a little bit hear

838
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:13,409
what they have to say and then again

839
00:30:13,409 --> 00:30:16,080
stick with the I don't know until I hear

840
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,210
everything that you have offer and

841
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:20,100
really that means finishing even the

842
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,010
interviewing process because truthfully

843
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:24,929
nobody comes to my agency because of but

844
00:30:24,929 --> 00:30:27,270
there's just that's not that's not it

845
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:29,580
right I mean you guys that's not it it's

846
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,320
really more about the job the people

847
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:34,260
maybe location can you work remote I

848
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,220
mean that was one of the biggest

849
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,740
challenges for York which was that you

850
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,169
remote you know your wife's a doctor you

851
00:30:40,169 --> 00:30:41,870
raise your two children

852
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:43,789
and the funny thing is like frost

853
00:30:43,789 --> 00:30:45,440
remotes no problem it doesn't matter of

854
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,270
it for meaning you could still help but

855
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:49,460
the he didn't people didn't know how to

856
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,860
you know represent you wrote at that and

857
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,929
talk to folks and sell you based on that

858
00:30:53,929 --> 00:30:56,029
which unfortunately you have to you know

859
00:30:56,029 --> 00:30:58,220
that's what the marketplace is because

860
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,960
we're not dating apps yet we don't have

861
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,240
that down yet you need an agent I'm

862
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,620
gonna create one though or I have so

863
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:09,200
let's talk about the interview fails so

864
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,130
this is another thing like how many

865
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:12,320
times we get in an interview and we say

866
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,610
one thing and we come out of her mouth

867
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:14,840
and we think that we answered the

868
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,940
question right and then somebody

869
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:19,460
misinterprets it so I just picked a few

870
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,200
like three here to go over and these are

871
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,260
generally common like so I don't answer

872
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:27,020
these yeah why are you why why are you

873
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,760
looking to leave your current job what's

874
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,789
what's the safe answer yeah well okay so

875
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:33,590
truth sells you can tell them all about

876
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:36,980
truth go with truth however words matter

877
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:40,610
and he can say one word that it gets a

878
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:42,260
reaction and say another word and it

879
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,640
gets a different reaction and it's the

880
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,549
same context so you must think that you

881
00:31:46,549 --> 00:31:48,950
must practice you must understand

882
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:51,470
without knowing the truth your truth I

883
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:53,480
you know can't necessarily give you the

884
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:57,890
answer however truth sells now I don't

885
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:59,659
like my boss it's probably one of the

886
00:31:59,659 --> 00:32:02,539
most common common things nobody wants

887
00:32:02,539 --> 00:32:04,880
to hear that that's not the answer that

888
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,590
they want to hear so what do you do if

889
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,539
it's you don't like the people you don't

890
00:32:08,539 --> 00:32:10,490
like your boss and you still want to

891
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:13,909
speak truth well go through your list so

892
00:32:13,909 --> 00:32:15,260
what I took what I said leave all-time

893
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,940
is first make a list what are all the

894
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,679
things is it really just the boss is

895
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:22,070
there is there like career aspiration

896
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:25,010
stuff that's missing is there maybe of

897
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:27,279
you know the commute is really long

898
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:30,740
maybe there's other things that it's all

899
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,380
truth and maybe the dot the the the boss

900
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:35,630
one is number one but who cares if the

901
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:37,899
career path one is there use that

902
00:32:37,899 --> 00:32:40,279
because people get a little weirded out

903
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:42,260
even though we all should be able to

904
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,649
relate that you know so it really is

905
00:32:45,649 --> 00:32:47,120
about like first put all your reasons

906
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,610
down on a piece of paper figure out

907
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:51,710
which ones will be less challenging for

908
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,560
people to get you know and

909
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,920
and talk to practice it really have it

910
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,780
down because this is the number one

911
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:01,180
thing people are looking for they want

912
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,100
to hire on passion they want to hire

913
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,620
like that you you're gonna be happy here

914
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:06,910
you're gonna be passionate about what

915
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:09,280
we're doing and so you know I tend to

916
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,780
think that the best way is to focus on

917
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,340
the role and the responsibilities and

918
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:15,190
and tackle it that way it's a it's a

919
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:17,380
tricky tricky thing for sure and what

920
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:19,030
ends up happening is there's a when you

921
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,260
ever you have these interviews that are

922
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,240
multiple people like we've been on them

923
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,740
where you go through rounds of three

924
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:26,200
five people a few of them want to see

925
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,640
what's good and you what can you bring

926
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,110
those are the really experienced

927
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,730
interviewers there's a few people that

928
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:32,320
go on the committee that just want to

929
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,640
find something wrong with you me a

930
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,650
reason why I can't hire you and those

931
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:37,960
are where you're these land mines you

932
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,540
really have to be cognitive because you

933
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,800
can ace interview with those other

934
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,910
people and that one person finds

935
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:45,700
something wrong and just it's like hey

936
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,200
let's move you more people let's go on

937
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,340
pretty soon you're kicked to the curb

938
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,500
and everybody forgets about you it's

939
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,660
super true we're all just because we're

940
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:55,240
not trained on hiring naturally we're

941
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,370
looking for reasons not to hire even

942
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:59,020
though we met your brain may not tell

943
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:01,150
you that I can tell you that in that

944
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:02,980
every time we have a you know somebody

945
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,210
interviews and all my years of

946
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:06,100
recruiting like the first things out of

947
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,270
their mouth when you say how did it go

948
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:10,330
it's always the bad and even when they

949
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:11,710
end up hiring that person they still

950
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,480
start with the bad or the things that

951
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,679
they thought weren't there because

952
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:16,659
they're just looking for that majority

953
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:18,760
of what we do is coaching is really get

954
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,080
back on the phone of higher manager well

955
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,600
what did they do good yeah yeah Mon this

956
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,159
is what you can do like the thing you're

957
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,380
thinking about is so minor and so like

958
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,989
you're overanalyzing it yeah tons and

959
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:30,520
tons of coaching cuz video like you said

960
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,830
there's a committee and you know new

961
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:34,870
managers and do I fight for this person

962
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:36,730
cuz I like them but somebody else in the

963
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:39,639
in the company said no to them and even

964
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:41,020
though it reports to me should I take

965
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,699
that on should I challenge that person

966
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:44,230
oh my goodness and so imagine if you

967
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:46,090
don't have an agent sticking up for you

968
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:47,949
to find out well what happened and what

969
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:49,510
was asked and well why did they ask them

970
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:50,620
that question that question has nothing

971
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:52,840
to do with this job and defend you

972
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,100
that's why I'm like how does it even

973
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,909
happen without us you know it's pretty

974
00:34:56,909 --> 00:35:00,850
interesting what we didn't do the

975
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:03,130
weaknesses one oh yeah yeah or two more

976
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:06,040
actually so the other common thing is

977
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,180
what are your weaknesses

978
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,480
been asked that question sitting here

979
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,849
hands it's the worst right again be

980
00:35:12,849 --> 00:35:15,760
ready for it what's your answer how much

981
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,150
you know can't come from truth without

982
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,930
saying you don't know how to document

983
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:23,710
you know and then whatever you find

984
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:25,150
coming out of your mouth when you're

985
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,920
preparing when you're writing down

986
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,440
things fix that to make your weaknesses

987
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,819
your strengths do you know we only have

988
00:35:30,819 --> 00:35:32,349
weaknesses when we don't know there are

989
00:35:32,349 --> 00:35:35,260
weaknesses typically in my world that

990
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:39,220
being said it is it is true that people

991
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,290
will ask this question I want something

992
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:44,349
significant so what is that gonna be for

993
00:35:44,349 --> 00:35:46,450
you you know for me I'd be like I Drive

994
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:48,430
by you know I drive by every executive

995
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:52,000
in my company I just sit down you know

996
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,349
and some of them love it and some of

997
00:35:53,349 --> 00:35:55,270
them are like oh my god I'm gonna you

998
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:56,890
know they're they're pulling their hair

999
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:58,300
out they're pinching themselves under

1000
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,980
the dust it's super uncomfortable for

1001
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,690
them and that's a weakness I shouldn't I

1002
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:04,089
need to pay more attention to that I

1003
00:36:04,089 --> 00:36:05,920
don't want them uncomfortable I do love

1004
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,740
to just drive by and let's do this so

1005
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,920
that's what I'd say if somebody asked me

1006
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,569
so you got to think about it and prepare

1007
00:36:13,569 --> 00:36:15,579
for it and then where do you see

1008
00:36:15,579 --> 00:36:17,319
yourself in three years this is the fun

1009
00:36:17,319 --> 00:36:21,549
classic one right and and also difficult

1010
00:36:21,549 --> 00:36:24,490
to answer and so think about it so the

1011
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:26,530
good news is that in your profession in

1012
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:28,599
cybersecurity there are you know where

1013
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:30,670
you want to go and so what I tell people

1014
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:33,010
is don't be afraid put it out there you

1015
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:34,540
know you might be an analyst today you

1016
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,650
want to be a chief information security

1017
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:37,839
officer great say it don't hide it

1018
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:39,880
anybody this doesn't like you because of

1019
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,890
that you don't want to work there

1020
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:43,299
anybody who doesn't like the path that

1021
00:36:43,299 --> 00:36:44,950
you've decided to choose and that's

1022
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:46,839
holds that against you great you've

1023
00:36:46,839 --> 00:36:49,450
eliminated them right instead of waiting

1024
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:50,920
till the end to be told they don't like

1025
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,690
you when you don't even want to work for

1026
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:54,190
them and then you your psyche gets

1027
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:56,950
damaged like no be yourself put it out

1028
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:58,839
there what is the answer to this where

1029
00:36:58,839 --> 00:37:00,790
do you want to be in three years and put

1030
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:02,559
it out there like I said it isn't like

1031
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:04,780
it the market the market will absorb you

1032
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:07,390
in a great way it might be painful as

1033
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:10,799
hell but once you land it'll feel good

1034
00:37:10,799 --> 00:37:15,130
so be truthful be prepared like write

1035
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:16,869
your answers down think about them what

1036
00:37:16,869 --> 00:37:18,520
if somebody said that to you when you

1037
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,410
were interviewing them would you like

1038
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:20,950
that

1039
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:23,579
how does it let you know words are

1040
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:27,369
SuperDuper impactful they start wars and

1041
00:37:27,369 --> 00:37:29,710
they end wars and I think about that

1042
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:31,960
every day when I'm speaking is that I

1043
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:35,800
can blow stuff up good enough or I can

1044
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,170
calm stuff down I can move things

1045
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:40,270
forward or I can make it go back just by

1046
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:42,280
my words just by what I say to people in

1047
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,260
at the office all day long clients

1048
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,609
doesn't matter who it is I can make that

1049
00:37:45,609 --> 00:37:48,430
happen so can you we all do the best

1050
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:49,420
part about these questions is they're

1051
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,260
gonna ask them to every single

1052
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,670
candidates interviewing so if you could

1053
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:54,190
own these you move their front line yeah

1054
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:56,530
yes yeah yeah you separate yourself

1055
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:58,780
you're not you not you no sweating

1056
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,970
you're ready you're putting it again I

1057
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:02,530
just want you to keep thinking about you

1058
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,680
decide whether they hire you not they

1059
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,510
decide you're taking control you're

1060
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:09,670
showing up ready you've got information

1061
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:12,550
you're interested you're interesting now

1062
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:14,650
it's all in your seat you know you get

1063
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:15,730
to make this let's talk about how we

1064
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:19,530
find the jobs okay

1065
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:22,960

1067
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:28,930
so yeah how do we find these jobs you

1068
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:30,940
job we keep hearing there's so many

1069
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,859
cyber jobs and there truly are remaining

1070
00:38:32,859 --> 00:38:34,480
industry there was so many vacancies

1071
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,160
there but how do you find them we got so

1072
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,569
many different job boards you got in

1073
00:38:37,569 --> 00:38:39,550
Dean you got monster you got all kind

1074
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,109
different laces look but not everybody

1075
00:38:41,109 --> 00:38:43,329
say each job works they each cost

1076
00:38:43,329 --> 00:38:46,089
different fees right and a lot of

1077
00:38:46,089 --> 00:38:48,010
companies think like hey we're such a

1078
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:49,390
popular brand they're gonna come to our

1079
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:51,099
website our career page and find it

1080
00:38:51,099 --> 00:38:53,170
reality is they're not you're not and

1081
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:54,130
then you're gonna get there and you're

1082
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:55,390
gonna read the job description some of

1083
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:56,500
you wrote it from the beginning of our

1084
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,000
talk we said is there vague they're

1085
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,200
gonna copy and paste and it's not gonna

1086
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,030
be the dog you're gonna blow by and

1087
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:03,869
you're gonna board or move on so

1088
00:39:03,869 --> 00:39:08,200
unfortunately and so link LinkedIn is

1089
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,520
there and I know that is cyber

1090
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,010
professionals 10 minutes the cyber

1091
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:13,960
professionals we are gonna sit of what

1092
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,430
we put on social media for operational

1093
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:18,579
security you're not gonna get fined

1094
00:39:18,579 --> 00:39:20,260
unless you're not on LinkedIn yeah it's

1095
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,690
your choice it's a choice it's

1096
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:23,680
definitely choice we're all about

1097
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,060
privacy and that doesn't give it to you

1098
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:27,490
that being said that is the number one

1099
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:31,000
place people go and the interesting

1100
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,460
piece about it is that they're gonna

1101
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,220
message

1102
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,780
hell out of you and you've got to decide

1103
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,190
whether you're gonna talk to them right

1104
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,869
so there's nothing convert about it

1105
00:39:38,869 --> 00:39:41,570
you're really you know not able to

1106
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:43,609
figure out who they are very easily so

1107
00:39:43,609 --> 00:39:45,680
here's the deal there are more technical

1108
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,119
recruiters than there are technologists

1109
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,010
which by implication says there's more

1110
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:51,080
to recruiters than there are of you all

1111
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,480
because people lump it under there is

1112
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,070
that not the craziest thing you've ever

1113
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:58,160
heard so that means these boards are

1114
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,080
made for agencies they're made for us

1115
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,570
okay they're not made for you by any

1116
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:04,550
means all their money comes from us we

1117
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:06,619
pay I pay LinkedIn a hell of a lot more

1118
00:40:06,619 --> 00:40:08,150
money than you'll ever have to pay them

1119
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:11,750
to have the same access like $3,500 a

1120
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:15,290
month per a year per recruiter where you

1121
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:17,570
pay 60 or so for the same for the same

1122
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:20,210
access okay so that's where they make

1123
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:22,130
their money and then and then posting

1124
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:23,990
the ads are and Linkedin is the most

1125
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:26,740
expensive fifteen hundred bucks or so

1126
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:29,630
you know but they're made for agencies

1127
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,369
they're not made for you so it doesn't

1128
00:40:31,369 --> 00:40:33,140
mean you shouldn't you know go after

1129
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,240
them look at them apply to that I'm just

1130
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,910
saying that it's it's it's a lot of work

1131
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:40,670
and if you truly are committed you're

1132
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:42,440
gonna have to work the boards if you

1133
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,200
don't have an agent

1134
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,670
the events like that's one of the great

1135
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:48,230
things about b-sides and all the events

1136
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:50,359
we do this is a place to market and meet

1137
00:40:50,359 --> 00:40:51,680
people I know that there's entry-level

1138
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:55,190
people in this room and I and I tell

1139
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:58,400
them all you've got it the worst because

1140
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,770
cyber yet hasn't figured out succession

1141
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:03,830
plans and and so therefore we can absorb

1142
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:06,140
juniors and so we're not absorbing

1143
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:09,349
juniors necessarily easily it takes a

1144
00:41:09,349 --> 00:41:11,420
lot of time to find so you all need to

1145
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:13,700
pound the pavement at these events these

1146
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:16,630
bracelets are nice I also tell people

1147
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:19,430
make a t-shirt put on the back of it I'm

1148
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:21,500
looking for a job I mean no joke put one

1149
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,810
on the front I mean we are in a crisis

1150
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:29,030
of content overload some you'll say what

1151
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:30,050
are you doing yeah I mean these are

1152
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:31,369
great but man imagine if that's why I

1153
00:41:31,369 --> 00:41:32,450
wear this shirt all the time like

1154
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:34,190
whatever I'm shameless I don't care I

1155
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,599
put my own money we're doing a great

1156
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:38,570
service I'm gonna wear this thing so you

1157
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:39,980
all got to think the same way it's

1158
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:42,190
broken get it out get yourself out there

1159
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:44,839
so these events are massively massively

1160
00:41:44,839 --> 00:41:47,180
important and just be willing to talk to

1161
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,110
people and Tillery but

1162
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:50,750
you're looking for a job very very soon

1163
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:53,510
we will have a covert job platform for

1164
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:55,580
you all it's not too far away we use a

1165
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,830
lot of the technology ourselves today

1166
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:59,600
we will release this it will compete

1167
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,000
with job boards because uh you know

1168
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,850
today that's the only place to go but

1169
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:06,890
it'll be for you not for agencies yeah

1170
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:10,130
and it'll change the game yeah well one

1171
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:11,690
of the reasons why I have the cyber team

1172
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:12,950
that I have yeah we're building a

1173
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:15,380
platform for them so you can market

1174
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:16,760
yourselves without getting her ass

1175
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:20,510
without and yes you know if you see our

1176
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:22,370
jobs posted today if you take a look at

1177
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:24,710
cyber sitcom just them they are posted

1178
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:26,450
using a product it speaks common

1179
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:28,280
language you're gonna do this every day

1180
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,960
this percentage this percentage that

1181
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,510
percentage is it's the baseline of your

1182
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:34,370
funds we've got questions we've got five

1183
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:38,140
minutes left let's let's do it yes

1184
00:42:46,219 --> 00:42:50,499
and the question rittany obama is that

1185
00:42:50,499 --> 00:42:54,680
pretty much every woman for sponsorship

1186
00:42:54,680 --> 00:43:00,499
so how does it job seeker be that's

1187
00:43:00,499 --> 00:43:02,299
right that's right well that's what this

1188
00:43:02,299 --> 00:43:03,710
platform that we're building is gonna do

1189
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:06,109
which makes you covert but also clearly

1190
00:43:06,109 --> 00:43:07,819
shows what you are so those women get

1191
00:43:07,819 --> 00:43:09,319
their pictures and their profile and

1192
00:43:09,319 --> 00:43:10,729
traditionally men are supposed to come

1193
00:43:10,729 --> 00:43:12,650
ask women so that's why that works but

1194
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:14,900
you know you know what that woman looks

1195
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,789
like and you know a lot about her before

1196
00:43:16,789 --> 00:43:21,559
you get to say hi to her right well

1197
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:24,109
that's that's the sex act not the dating

1198
00:43:24,109 --> 00:43:28,729
act so different story but that's my

1199
00:43:28,729 --> 00:43:31,700
answer is that it's what do you do a

1200
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:33,799
security title doesn't tell me anything

1201
00:43:33,799 --> 00:43:35,930
and most likely the stuff on your resume

1202
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:37,219
isn't gonna tell me anything because

1203
00:43:37,219 --> 00:43:39,109
here's what you do as job seekers we

1204
00:43:39,109 --> 00:43:40,759
wide our resume based on the jobs we

1205
00:43:40,759 --> 00:43:44,539
want so right and as hiring

1206
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:46,640
organizations we make our ads based on

1207
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,680
the persona the person we think we want

1208
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,390
to hire three years of this five years

1209
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:51,469
or that that's not a job description

1210
00:43:51,469 --> 00:43:53,930
that's a persona of the person we think

1211
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:55,759
we want to hire so we need to flip it

1212
00:43:55,759 --> 00:43:57,890
around and we all need to say this is

1213
00:43:57,890 --> 00:43:59,269
what I do for the last year I've done

1214
00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:01,910
10% this 20% this 20 right and the year

1215
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:04,249
before I did this and so that people can

1216
00:44:04,249 --> 00:44:06,440
stand who you are are you that pretty

1217
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:09,049
lady and that's pretty to me right we're

1218
00:44:09,049 --> 00:44:10,519
all beautiful to each other in different

1219
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:14,390
ways or not and so that's my answer to

1220
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:16,309
you and there's some analytics behind it

1221
00:44:16,309 --> 00:44:18,849
maybe too

1222
00:44:35,549 --> 00:44:41,190
yeah oh you're by yourself

1223
00:44:53,549 --> 00:44:55,989
yeah let's restate the question yeah

1224
00:44:55,989 --> 00:44:57,369
good mic dude

1225
00:44:57,369 --> 00:44:59,259
for who the microphones let's restate

1226
00:44:59,259 --> 00:45:00,730
the question so the question is about

1227
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:02,650
salary calculator how do you know what

1228
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:04,299
you're worth or what the she's paying is

1229
00:45:04,299 --> 00:45:06,670
what yeah this yeah and the data one to

1230
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:08,410
two years old at best it falls under IT

1231
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:10,239
we already talked about it's 20% higher

1232
00:45:10,239 --> 00:45:11,950
so you got it you understand your graph

1233
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:13,599
yeah I said look this is an IT this

1234
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,980
isn't software this is cybersecurity I

1235
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:17,470
need to be need to be looked at that way

1236
00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:19,210
that's too low for me that's not the

1237
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:20,769
band's I'm in today if you want to share

1238
00:45:20,769 --> 00:45:22,059
what you're making today share it if

1239
00:45:22,059 --> 00:45:23,529
that at that moment it probably would

1240
00:45:23,529 --> 00:45:25,359
help you right because nobody expects

1241
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:27,099
anybody to take less money so at that

1242
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:29,019
moment it'll help you I'm two months

1243
00:45:29,019 --> 00:45:31,390
away from releasing a real-time salary

1244
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:33,519

1247
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:38,950
base salary covertly in here let's

1248
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:41,529
empower HR it's a big problem for me and

1249
00:45:41,529 --> 00:45:43,359
my clients on my hiring managers nuts

1250

1251
00:45:44,529 --> 00:45:46,119
hard then we go to HR and they've

1252
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:47,650
already been told yeah you can hire over

1253
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:49,539
the budget but then they go to hire and

1254
00:45:49,539 --> 00:45:50,769
