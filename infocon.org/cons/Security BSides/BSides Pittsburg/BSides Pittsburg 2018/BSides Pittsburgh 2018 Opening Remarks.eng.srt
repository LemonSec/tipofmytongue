96
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,620
gonna have job problems in the future

97
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:50,770

121
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,770
just this there we go

122
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,930
hi everybody my name is John seola so

123
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:07,449
we're gonna have three CTFs at this

124
00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:08,650
event which is pretty awesome in the

125
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,300
past we've barely eked out one and this

126
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,370
year we have three one of them is

127
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,169
actually the same Wireless CTF that's

128
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:16,360
run at the wireless village at DEFCON so

129
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,400
if you want to check that out I'll go to

130
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,310
the last room the Ohio room in addition

131
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:24,160
to that we have kind of a a red team

132
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,490
simulated a capture the flag event which

133
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,650
is supposed to be similar to you know if

134
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,720
you're actually doing a red team pen

135
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,669
test on like a company right so there's

136
00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:34,690
different types of servers that you can

137
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:35,820
try to break into things like that

138
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,740
similar so that one required Eventbrite

139
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,750
registration if you didn't register go

140
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,830
talk to the guys in the back where that

141
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,530
guy with the lights around his neck

142
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:47,560
he'll help you out that's Dan and and we

143
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,789
can get you guys all set up for that

144
00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:50,289
it'll be a great time there are gonna be

145
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:52,360
plenty of prizes that I'll be rewarding

146
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,590
at the end of this that goes until 4:30

147
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:00,310
believe for 34 for 34 4 o'clock cutoff

148
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,139
is at 4 o'clock and we'll be announcing

149
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:03,820
and giving those prizes out afterwards

150
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,880
so and then the third CTF is one of our

151
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,610
sponsors actually 0.3 they they have a

152
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,199
