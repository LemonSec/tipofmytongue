1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,709
the next grade talk is Michael Westen

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,879
I'll let him take it from here thanks

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:09,570
all right thanks guys good morning today

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:10,769
we're gonna talk about tool I built

5
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:12,570
called century and this whole thing's

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:13,710
kind of themed around the Stanley

7
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,139
Kubrick film dr. Strangelove or I

8
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:17,609
learned to stop worrying and drop the

9
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:19,320
bomb and you'll kind of see why it's a

10
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,880
little bit of that kind of imminent

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,470
nuclear threat and what we're gonna do

12
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,980
about it so real quick intro slide I'm

13
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,930
from Dallas Texas representing Cossack

14
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,689
association DHA I worked at a little

15
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:31,949
tiny startup nobody's heard of called

16
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,739
cyber-ark I've done like ITA added

17
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:36,870
software dev and then kind of moved in

18
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,700
InfoSec or the past like six years so

19
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,440
I've kind of done everything and there's

20
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,940
some available keywords because like

21
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,890
stuff I'm interested in you say well is

22
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,050
word so I'll probably perk up and I

23
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,100
guess that's proof I'm not a vampire

24
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,670
that I didn't get my pictures taken

25
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:53,570
moving on does anyone remember this yes

26
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,460
it's been a little while I know 2016 was

27
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,680
a while ago we were so innocent back

28
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,160
then but this is a gift that Trump

29
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,040
tweeted are those 2017 my 16 was the

30
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,130
election but we did this gift and this

31
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,979
was right in the middle of the the whole

32
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:14,939
media thing who the trust do we you know

33
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,470
Trump is like going on about the media

34
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,180
and ragging on about them saying thank

35
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,530
news all that stuff was really at the

36
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,170
height right then and he tweeted that

37
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,080
CNN wasn't very happy because it shows

38
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,780
them being beat up nobody really knows

39
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,420
where he got this gift or how he got

40
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,210
this gift but we do know is who created

41
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,909
it there was a reddit user who just

42
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:38,009
creates you know all sorts of gifts I

43
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:39,360
guess you could almost call it

44
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,850
posting just on reddit and just posting

45
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,420
gifts and doing this thing and we don't

46
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,799
know how it got from him to trump but

47
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,860
the trail led back to him that users

48
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,560
name was Han solo and I love

49
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,570
that they blanked out the ass in there

50
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,350
but CNN found him found his original

51
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,240
post and then they started to dachshund

52
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,190
using details left over on the the UH on

53
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,459
his just biographical information he

54
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:12,720
didn't post his name or anything they

55
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,680
just found it out

56
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,069
data and so what they did to him is they

57
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:19,920
kind of said oh you better apologize or

58
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,739
we're gonna publish information all over

59
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:25,319
you no he didn't send it to trump he

60
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:26,700
just made his own gif on his own

61
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,670
personal reddit page and so they

62
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,849
basically forced him to write an apology

63
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:35,040
about differing accounts but that's kind

64
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,030
of how it looks from the outside

65
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,400
and so we post an apology and said you

66
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,859
know I won't make gifts anymore and so

67
00:02:40,859 --> 00:02:41,989
how'd they find it they said

68
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:44,069
biographical data left on his reddit

69
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:48,299
page people become what I call

70
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:50,909
incidentally viral every day here we

71
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:53,669
have Sarah Connor who just journalist

72
00:02:53,669 --> 00:02:55,319
who'd start talking about robots killing

73
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:57,239
workers at give you plants I think I see

74
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:59,760
the reference there it was just you know

75
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,230
a journalist who talks about like labor

76
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:04,049
issues in Germany I believe and then she

77
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:05,519
posted that and now she has like ten

78
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,049
thousand retweets and lots people

79
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:08,609
talking about her you know just from

80
00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:11,239
something relatively silly like a name

81
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:16,760
conflict with the Terminator series and

82
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:21,239
Ken bone from 2016 now I can say we were

83
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:23,519
so into sent back then Ken bone you know

84
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,139
he's that lovable guy he was on the

85
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:26,879
debates you know he's got the bright red

86
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,189
sweater and after he kind of got some

87
00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:30,470
notoriety for being this kind of

88
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:33,569
innocent guy who just had a really you

89
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:35,909
know cute couple TV moments he didn't

90
00:03:35,909 --> 00:03:36,810
AMA and read it

91
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,090
he used his reddit account that he

92
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,169
normally uses to look up and that porn I

93
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:46,169
believe was MPEG porn Google it just not

94
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:51,000
here if you don't know it is so and this

95
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,739
is not just limited to like people who

96
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:54,299
show up in the news this happens to

97
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:56,970
InfoSec researchers too you guys know

98
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,310
Marcus Hutchins known also known as

99
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,769
malware tech blog on Twitter or just

100
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:05,129
malware tech he helps stop the wanna cry

101
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:06,629
virus by noticing there was bug in the

102
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:09,299
code check for a domain it was supposed

103
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:10,650
to change every time but only checked

104
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,810
once but only change it only did one

105
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,269
domain you registered the domain and now

106
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:17,190
when you want to cry viruses that have

107
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,599
the internet sex access were stopped and

108
00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:23,880
he got put up in the news you know named

109
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,210
as a hero but he worked like anonymous

110
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:31,080
he pursued anonymously from the UK well

111
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,080
he came to Def Con last year I did the

112
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,060
DEF CON thing you know go out and party

113
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,250
last day goes to leave that the I

114
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,560
stopped some arrests and now he's still

115
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,080
stuck in the u.s. under charges saying

116
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:48,210
he wrote some breaking malware and the

117
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,910
reason this comes up is because while he

118
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,830
was in Vegas he did the normal thing he

119
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,750
posts on social media about what he's

120
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,789
doing you know you rents a car supercars

121
00:04:56,789 --> 00:04:58,560
not really a big deal there it costs

122
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,270
like five nerve bucks he went to a

123
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,130
shooting range lots of people in the

124
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:05,490
photo shooting but not like any crazy

125
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:06,810
things these are the kind of things you

126
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,370
do in Vegas on your vacation I think

127
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:09,509
that was his first time out of the

128
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:12,360
country actually and so what happens in

129
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,520
Vegas can be publicized after your

130
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,009
arrest he was arrested and there's a

131
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:18,509
whole bunch of news that he can't

132
00:05:18,509 --> 00:05:21,150
control cuz he's in jail and they're

133
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,530
showing they're kind of taking up all

134
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,060
this dirt about these things that he's

135
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,800
done Vegas you know he's spending big

136
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,099
like he's some big criminal but I think

137
00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:30,180
most of us know that's probably not the

138
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,120
case so I always wondered like what if

139
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,620
this happens to me this is kind of thing

140
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,020
that keeps me up at night I don't have a

141
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,570
great risk stance like I use social

142
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,130
media pretty heavily oh that's old

143
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:44,220
profile picture isn't it and I you know

144
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,720
it's got my real name up there I use the

145
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,180
same username and everything I'm kind of

146
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,960
not trying to be hidden but I've always

147
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,979
wondered what happens if something like

148
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:55,889
this happens here's a good example it's

149
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:58,710
really simple Michael West in st. Louis

150
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,620
like 45 years old probably wouldn't use

151
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,190
them for me but went and tipped the

152
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,930
student and was still working at the

153
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:08,580
school like six months later after being

154
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,250
charged great stuff but I've always

155
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,310
wondered what that happens in Dallas to

156
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,259
maybe like twenty five year old or

157
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:18,060
something I mean there's several Michael

158
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,919
West's and Dallas already what if

159
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,180
there's any kind of name confusion or

160
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,770
simply looking after me if you guys

161
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,960
remember the Boston bombing thing with

162
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,820
Reddit and kind of the witch hunt they

163
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,009
did that kind of stuff makes me wonder

164
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:31,620
what happens whatever happens to me and

165
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,020
so there's only really been three

166
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,900
solutions that people have told me it's

167
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,400
it's always been coming down to

168
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,010
don't post anything just censor yourself

169
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:44,919
there don't post anything that is public

170
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:46,660
or don't post anything that could even

171
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,570
come back to bite you and if you do have

172
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:50,260
to do that kind of stuff

173
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,090
compartmentalize it you know your

174
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:53,560
pornhub account should probably be a

175
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,910
different username than your regular

176
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:57,010
account that kind of stuff if you do

177
00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:00,280
that the second option has always been I

178
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,030
just avoid social media or use it in a

179
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:05,860
different way than its intended so use a

180
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,010
student keep everything anonymous the

181
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:11,290
that doesn't really seem like great to

182
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:12,760
me because you're losing the value of

183
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,250
social media join the conversation and

184
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,260
being part of community which is pretty

185
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,880
big InfoSec InfoSec on twitter for

186
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,580
example and then the third option i

187
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,169
think most of us do is Niall ism which

188
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:25,330
is just you know that's not gonna happen

189
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:31,060
me I should be fine right right so I

190
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,919
come up with this idea of something

191
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,590
different so we make this program called

192
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:38,139
century that watches for certain

193
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:40,930
criteria so this could be something you

194
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:43,599
post you know just a coded message or

195
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,970
something your friend can post to it

196
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,650
could be something like if you have over

197
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,380
a thousand retweets lock your account

198
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,039
you know just in case you're getting

199
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,680
someone wanted attention or you know run

200
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,090
your own scripts run your own detections

201
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,440
and then just call to this whenever you

202
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,690
want to actually do something and it can

203
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:01,599
trigger cascade of actions so one thing

204
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,550
can do another thing which cause another

205
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,830
thing or you can have one detection

206
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:08,560
instead of something else really the

207
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,990
goal here is to either lock down your

208
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,199
accounts wipe them or delete them and I

209
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:16,630
got to go with the gay furry account is

210
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,370
a good example of this now I don't

211
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:19,990
really care about the furry fandom but I

212
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:22,380
know a lot of people there who are

213
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,330
pseudo anonymous they don't use their

214
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,500
real name and the furry community

215
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,910
because they don't want to be attached

216
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,680
to their real identity you know there

217
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,940
could be someone who's like a senator

218
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,799
who goes and does it on their own spare

219
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,440
time that's cool but what if there was

220
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,570
ever a connection leaked and they need

221
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:39,010
to go and quickly delete that account

222
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:40,750
and I've always the snare has always

223
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,900
been what if you were in the cop car

224
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,820
being taken five minutes to station

225
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,870
you'd have your phone for that five

226
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,339
minutes what are you gonna do in that

227
00:08:48,339 --> 00:08:51,010
time if you have a Python script in your

228
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:52,329
laptop that's probably not gonna help

229
00:08:52,329 --> 00:08:53,140
you unless you

230
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,270
a really good setup and this is kind of

231
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,410
thing that you can trigger just by

232
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:00,250
tweeting a phrase you can memorize so

233
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,110
the T of all this is written in C

234
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,090
sharp with net core which runs on

235
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:06,130
Windows Mac and Linux I've tested one of

236
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,590
the Linux could use some Mac reports

237
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,700
everything is configured via simple JSON

238
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:14,190
config I say simple its straightforward

239
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,350
you can also call from those scripts

240
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,550
we're using selenium to actually

241
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,590
automate the webpages so by clocking

242
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:22,300
plugging into twitter.com and locking

243
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,170
your account and then for API is restr

244
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,960
and there's an example of what one

245
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,460
trigger criteria looks like that says

246
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,140
when I tweet a wing attack plan are

247
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:35,530
it'll check my public twitter then it'll

248
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:37,390
lock my public twitter and it'll scorch

249
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,280
which means delete all the posts and

250
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,130
delete my sinful twitter the Jennifer

251
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:45,640
account this is what the services look

252
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,560
like so that last one said public

253
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,910
Twitter this is another example that

254
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,380
this is an account will be deleting

255
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,890
today called delete me senpai simple

256
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:57,970
username password now there is a problem

257
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,770
where you have this JSON file with all

258
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,420
these names and passwords and all the

259
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,040
goods authentication details and your

260
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,260
OAuth stuff so cyber code a little

261
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,210
program called conjure it's open-source

262
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,530
I just use the open source version

263
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:10,720
there's an tur price thing but it lets

264
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,880
us take the secrets out of the config

265
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,610
file and call them from a REST API you

266
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:17,080
don't have to use that but it's

267
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,550
available they can also support other

268
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:21,490
secret servers as well make see right

269
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:24,390
there conjure eval is the name of it and

270
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:34,980
so let's give it a quick demo all right

271
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,800
so first we'll open up our config file

272
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,040
right here and you can see I think I

273
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,070
should have the best lesson yeah well

274
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:47,800
I'll change that key as you can see here

275
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,050
the only thing that's actually public is

276
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,730
that one key there at the bottom

277
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:54,460
everything else here uses contra Val so

278
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,260
everything is just pulled from that

279
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,470
contra database again you could just

280
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:01,050
delete the contra Val here and just use

281
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:04,780
that but it's a lot of user present if

282
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,200
you have to share keys

283
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,040
and so right here's our first criteria

284
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,250
at b-sides PGH need more snacks and

285
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,010
track black do you guys agree here we've

286
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,750
got some other ones here retweets over

287
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:21,620
10,000 favorites over a thousand I don't

288
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,240
think we'll hit those numbers today so

289
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,050
that's fine

290
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,540
we'll go with the tweet one and it's

291
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:29,000
just gonna simply check my main Twitter

292
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,820
account over the API and so I'll skip

293
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,579
down here before we define that you've

294
00:11:34,579 --> 00:11:37,220
got the API right here used to order API

295
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,620
I've got the OAuth junk that's super

296
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:44,959
verbose and here's what's gonna post and

297
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,279
so back up to our service config we say

298
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:51,320
we're gonna post that one message on the

299
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,269
main Twitter account and then a second

300
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:55,160
Twitter account we're gonna lock it so

301
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,240
I'll pull up that Twitter connect here

302
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,829
here's the main one with cyber Wario and

303
00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:01,639
here's that account that we're gonna

304
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:05,899
lock I see right here actually it gets

305
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:07,820
every post time that's posted bleeded I

306
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,380
have to go post something else so that's

307
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:12,350
today's message it's called uber kitten

308
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:15,170
Tom so what we'll do is we're gonna

309
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:17,420
start up sentry now a lot of stuffs

310
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,649
gonna happen really quick cuz it's all

311
00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:20,660
load in one big config file but I'll

312
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:24,560
explain it as it goes and normally when

313
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,579
you run in like production mode

314
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:27,740
everything's headless but to show it an

315
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:32,360
example of it it will show the chrome

316
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,050
shows as it goes through so first it's

317
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:37,339
gonna load the services and it's gonna

318
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:40,250
start verifying them here at star Liam

319
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:45,110
processes with Google Chrome and starts

320
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,790
up to because we've got two web accounts

321
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:49,519
and then you can ignore most of stuff at

322
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,529
the top that's chrome junk here we're

323
00:12:51,529 --> 00:12:53,029
verifying all the services so it

324
00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:55,120
verifies the API make sure it can work

325
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,350
next it's gonna verify the web Twitter

326
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,699
accounts it's gonna make sure it can log

327
00:12:58,699 --> 00:13:00,740
in on selenium there's no point in

328
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,600
trying to actually do something if you

329
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,779
can have the wrong password then so it's

330
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:06,980
gonna go through that it's gonna check

331
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:12,829
after it logs in okey doke and so it

332
00:13:12,829 --> 00:13:18,189
should say verified it worked in Tom Web

333
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:20,529
as soon as it finishes loading there we

334
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:22,600
go and now it's gonna do the same thing

335
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,160
for that segment kinda mentioned delete

336
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,730
me senpai which actually got deleted

337
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,769
because Twitter will delete if you don't

338
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:31,930
if you go to deactivate your account if

339
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:34,089
you don't do it within 30 days footer

340
00:13:34,089 --> 00:13:35,649
will actually delete it so I figured

341
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,149
that our last nighttime why isn't this

342
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:41,760
Cal can't I log in oh yeah I deleted it

343
00:13:42,269 --> 00:13:49,000
both of those are backup and oh one more

344
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,399
thing we can also change IP addresses or

345
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,750
CloudFlare dns registries so you can

346
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,730
have your site YouGov temporary Oh

347
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:01,839
temporarily offline anyways the first

348
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,510
one we're gonna do is ask for more

349
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:11,860
snacks so I'm gonna go and copy that and

350
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,240
again it's checking my main Twitter

351
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,040
account that's actually gonna run the

352
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,720
actions on this Twitter account to lock

353
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,360
it will do that and it's checking every

354
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,000
15 seconds I believe so it shouldn't

355
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,320
take too long for it to pick up that

356
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,470
change it's gonna go and lock that other

357
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,510
account and it's gonna post on my main

358
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:35,380
account so we got trigger detected I'm

359
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,940
gonna watch this just so you can see it

360
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:40,500
it's going to go to the profile page

361
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:45,670
check the box and then type in your

362
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:50,079
password and again in normal headless

363
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:51,790
mode you wouldn't see this but it's a

364
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,100
lot easier to demonstrate okay so that

365
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:58,839
accounts locked and we posted the

366
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:04,060
Twitter status let's go look at it I'll

367
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:07,779
do tweeting replies there it is

368
00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:09,640
something like guys need to get the code

369
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,860
just go look at the replies to East

370
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:16,709
Side's BGH okay so that's the first one

371
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:19,149
next we're gonna look at another Twitter

372
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:21,190
another trigger and this one's actually

373
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:23,230
going to delete the other account and

374
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:26,350
scorch one of the other accounts so

375
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,720
where's that one at right here wing

376
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,430
attack plan are is from dr.

377
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,649
Strangelove's it's

378
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:33,779
man they gave to go and launch the nukes

379
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:36,480
and no we're calling it back so it'll do

380
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,459
here is it's gonna check against can

381
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:39,990
check my main Twitter account over the

382
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:45,529
API for this string a chopped copy now

383
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:47,639
and then what it's going to do is it's

384
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:50,429
going to go to this this account that we

385
00:15:50,429 --> 00:15:54,059
just locked which will see once i

386
00:15:54,059 --> 00:15:58,470
refresh it locked and it's gonna do

387
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,720
scorch and I call scorched that way to

388
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,279
differentiate from delete scorch means

389
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,319
delete all your posts for example

390
00:16:04,319 --> 00:16:05,939
services like reddit if you delete your

391
00:16:05,939 --> 00:16:07,259
account your posts still stick around

392
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:08,910
unless you go and edit them and clear

393
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:12,029
them and then on this third account that

394
00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:13,379
we haven't seen yet delete you senpai

395
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:15,509
it's actually gonna go and delete or

396
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:18,059
deactivate the account is that kind

397
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:19,199
right now you can see it's called uber

398
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,279
kitten sinful account that's where I pro

399
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:29,339
post all my my very unsavory things so

400
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:31,829
we should be set to go and delete that

401
00:16:31,829 --> 00:16:32,249
account

402
00:16:32,249 --> 00:16:34,649
so now just gonna wait this and then

403
00:16:34,649 --> 00:16:35,759
this is the kind of scenario I was

404
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,040
thinking you're in the back of police

405
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,720
car you don't have a lot of time you can

406
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,920
type this phrase that you've memorized

407
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,920
and turner everything from there or if

408
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,569
you trust someone you could say go check

409
00:16:45,569 --> 00:16:47,129
their Twitter feed for when they post

410
00:16:47,129 --> 00:16:49,249
this and then you can have them do it

411
00:16:49,249 --> 00:16:53,490
so we'll tweet that and we'll watch and

412
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,319
this is all stuff from before just the

413
00:16:55,319 --> 00:16:59,040
things that was doing so we'll wait that

414
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:06,659
15 seconds so for that to pull up there

415
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:10,648
it is so this one's using the API delete

416
00:17:10,648 --> 00:17:12,059
any tweets on the rubric and calm

417
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:14,398
account and this which we just barely

418
00:17:14,398 --> 00:17:16,349
caught is actually deleting

419
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:24,319
elite me senpai account once it loads

420
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:28,830
there we go so now this account right

421
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:31,020
here that ironically we can't see the

422
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,510
tweets so I'm gonna pull it up over here

423
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,799
we used to have a gif on that account

424
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:38,750
but now wants me to send my first tweet

425
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,840
and on this delete me senpai account

426
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,170
fresh it's gone

427
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,330
now I would recommend if you planned do

428
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:49,240
this to scorch your tweets and then

429
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,920
delete your account because if you

430
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,260
deactivate your account and reactivate

431
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,600
it but sweet stay there if it goes

432
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,310
through the 30-day solution they're gone

433
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:03,730
but so that in a nutshell is century and

434
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,410
how it works let's actually go stop that

435
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:10,720
real quick and I'm just running a visual

436
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,430
studio because it's easy to run into bug

437
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,560
mode like that but runs great from the

438
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,900
command line so here is the features

439
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,320
overall just my up fan mode

440
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,660
which we'll get to the next slide we can

441
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,580
do Twitter or the API check for a few

442
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,770
things I would really love if anybody

443
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:28,930
has more suggestions on triggers on what

444
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:31,810
to post that's all I could think of when

445
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,190
we log onto Twitter on the web we can

446
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:36,180
lock and deactivate accounts elite

447
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,680
CloudFlare we can update DNS records and

448
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,140
delete DNS records so for example just

449
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,840
take your website down push over which I

450
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,460
barely mentioned I've actually been

451
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,230
getting notifications from pushover

452
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,790
about what's been going on when it

453
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,260
starts when it does actions what

454
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,750
triggers something so if you set this up

455
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,940
on a server you know monitoring you'll

456
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,640
get push notifications and then conjuror

457
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,530
which we talked about some things are

458
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,120
still being worked on our multi-factor

459
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,060
support which that one's real Tuffy the

460
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,460
way of currently working on it is you'll

461
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:09,040
get a push notification sent hey we need

462
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,960
to log into your Twitter account you

463
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,640
click on it you open a web page you type

464
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,110
in the code and then it stays

465
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,730
authenticated and it tries to check

466
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:18,130
whatever room remember me boxes it can

467
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,960
and then keep the session alive by just

468
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,130
refreshing it in the background

469
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,900
so hopefully you shouldn't have to do it

470
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,780
more than like maybe once a month or so

471
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:29,440
whenever that expiration expires next

472
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,540
we're looking on reddit via the API so

473
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,680
it's gonna be blinking and deleting

474
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:36,010
posts and reddit my web emailing or

475
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:38,620
deleting accounts for email that's gonna

476
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,870
be kind of something where I think the

477
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:41,950
lot of people have been asking me about

478
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:44,020
a Deadman switch for this and that's

479
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,190
where I think that could come into play

480
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:47,050
because there are lots of Deadman switch

481
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:49,000
services that will send an email if you

482
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,260
don't respond to something after a

483
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,330
certain amount of time and so just how

484
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:54,970
to check your email and then check for

485
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:57,010
the phrase of being attacked at being

486
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:57,730
sure

487
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,610
and then clustering support later on so

488
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:01,630
you can have this running on multiple

489
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:04,210
servers so if they do actually fail you

490
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:07,510
have to worry about it this is the gist

491
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,970
 my up fan mode so he runs

492
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:12,279
everything like you had had all the

493
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:14,169
triggers sent its prompt for

494
00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:17,919
confirmation skip that and it's a great

495
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,600
way to call sentry from your own script

496
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,279
so if you don't want to deal with that

497
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:22,389
all stuff you want to have your own

498
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:25,659
Python script go and detect all you know

499
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:27,549
detect whatever you want and just call

500
00:20:27,549 --> 00:20:29,019
this to actually do the hard work of

501
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,730
doing selenium stuff go for it

502
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,070
those are the commands you run and you

503
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,630
just stick some JSON in there or stick a

504
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:39,159
file name there with the JSON it so on

505
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:40,750
the left right there is the link to the

506
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,269
code and the git repository if you don't

507
00:20:43,269 --> 00:20:45,309
want to type out my username t3 htv-3

508
00:20:45,309 --> 00:20:48,279
rk1 tgen there's a shortcut M Wes slash

509
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:52,120
github and then that's me on the right

510
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,909
good name Twitter account feel free to

511
00:20:54,909 --> 00:20:57,429
come questions I'd really love to get

512
00:20:57,429 --> 00:21:00,159
any ideas you guys have for services you

513
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,320
want to have on this I'd know some

514
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,779
people ask about Graham on Facebook what

515
00:21:04,779 --> 00:21:06,190
kind of services you guys would like to

516
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:09,940
see be deleted or have your post deleted

517
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,710
or what kind of triggers you guys would

518
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,659
want to have or any suggestions for

519
00:21:13,659 --> 00:21:16,269
making this easier but that's all I got

520
00:21:16,269 --> 00:21:20,460
if you guys got any questions go ahead

521
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:45,870
so the question was can we set it up so

522
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:48,600
that we can if you don't respond to a

523
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,010
Deadman switch it'll send out

524
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,480
information to like journalists or

525
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,160
something or they Julian Assange

526
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,940
WikiLeaks password type thing you could

527
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,530
use that with the post functionality

528
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:00,480
it's not quite the best fit because this

529
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,380
is designed to delete but it's possible

530
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,740
it's not quite the the what it was

531
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,640
designed for but I think it would work

532
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,780
not yes because it's kind of rainy

533
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,100
especially with the multi-factor being

534
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,570
not quite there I'm kind of looking to

535
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:39,120
get some traction on this idea because I

536
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,280
don't think anybody's really thought

537
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,660
about doing I know some people have

538
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,620
thought about doing this but no one has

539
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,170
really implemented it I guess at scale

540
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:47,700
or across lots of people it's all been

541
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,440
homegrown Python scripts running on like

542
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,780
your laptop and stuff so I have had

543
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:55,380
requests though from I want to say it's

544
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,690
yes it was lawyers I was asked in

545
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:01,470
Rochester about what lawyers they may

546
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,940
use their social media stuff and then

547
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,550
that could come up later in court or go

548
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,960
I look bad again their character and

549
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,730
stuff for the bar exam so that's the

550
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:11,070
ones who have been asked for outside of

551
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,930
guess the hacker community they've asked

552
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,710
about this so

553
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:26,750
what API is like the the Twitter API is

554
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:27,870
easy

555
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:30,990
the hard part is the sites that like it

556
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,340
doesn't let you do eight your account

557
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,480
without logging on to the web interface

558
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,640
that's why we use selenium to go and

559
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,440
click buttons and actually type in

560
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,720
passwords and simulate everything that

561
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,120
you would do as a human but which is

562
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,580
surprisingly easy it's only like ten

563
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,260
lines of code for that whole thing about

564
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,809
deleting your account it's quite simple

565
00:23:48,809 --> 00:23:51,690
I love selenium and that's why we kind

566
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:54,240
of have that this mode so that if you

567
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,910
want to just have it do all the work and

568
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:57,870
you just want to run it from your own

569
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:02,940
thing go ahead pull welcome but all

570
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,230
right let's got any more questions I

571
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:06,410
think we wrap it up thanks guys

572
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:13,599
[Applause]
