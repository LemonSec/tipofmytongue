wanted to say yeah hey everybody my name

96
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,919
is Kevin Janu so you might know me from

97
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:02,340
such places as besides Pittsburgh or I

98
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,880
worked with you at some point or

99
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,640
something along those lines but we had

100
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,040
another a good friend of mine good

101
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,630
personal friend that I knew known since

102
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,960
college and he was a friend of b-sides

103
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,000
passed away at the beginning of the year

104
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,419
his name was Eric Mick Ulis his first

105
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:25,710
b-sides was 2012 where he did a

106
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:29,700
presentation on QR codes and how QR

107
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:33,919
codes can be used in a malicious way

108
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,860
Eric kind of came from a software

109
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,949
development background which made him a

110
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:43,769
really good kind of application

111
00:05:43,769 --> 00:05:45,779
penetration tester because he understood

112
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:47,849
the kind of mistakes that people would

113
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:53,369
make in software and he was also kind of

114
00:05:53,369 --> 00:05:58,199
had fun with pointing out flaws so he

115
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,419
was he was you know a little bit of a

116
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:02,189
jerk but it made him a good application

117
00:06:02,189 --> 00:06:05,639
tester you know to give you any idea

118
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:09,509
after he had passed away to unlock his

119
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:12,229
laptop they had to use his middle finger

120
00:06:12,229 --> 00:06:16,519
so he was a jerk but he was our jerk and

121
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:19,829
if you look at the t-shirt this year

122
00:06:19,829 --> 00:06:23,579
you'll see a little Grateful Dead logo

123
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:26,249
on the t-shirt and that's to kind of

124
00:06:26,249 --> 00:06:31,139
honor Eric so he leaves behind a little

125
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:32,719
girl she's ten now

126
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:36,419
her name's Sophie she found him whenever

127
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:39,179
he passed away so I started to go fund
