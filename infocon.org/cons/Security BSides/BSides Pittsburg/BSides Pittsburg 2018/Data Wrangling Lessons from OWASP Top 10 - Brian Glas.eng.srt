1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,980
everybody mics on now all right so we're

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,720
gonna get started here this is brian

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,519
glass he's gonna do a talk on a wasp and

4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:10,139
i'm sure it's gonna be very exciting so

5
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:11,429
it's a great way to start the day and

6
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:19,020
enjoy it there we go all right so we

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,109
only have one mic on that's good good

8
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:24,390
morning everybody I know it's a little

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,000
after 9:00 but you know that's why we

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,340
have padding and schedules is so that we

11
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,820
don't like end up with talks till 6:00

12
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:36,149
my name is Brian glass I've work for a

13
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:38,309
small offset consulting company called

14
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:42,000
invisi 'm i spent a lot of time working

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,510
on oo stuff was one of the co leads for

16
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,360
Sam and then in parallel like a lead for

17
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,899
the a aw stop ten so today will be some

18
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:55,469
of that story about last year has who

19
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:57,000
all has heard about the top ten before

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,760
I'm hoping for a sizable percentage okay

21
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,129
good the rest of you just haven't had

22
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:04,140
enough coffee or you're still staring at

23
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,170
your phone uh-huh

24
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,630
so I'm having a small competition with

25
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,860
my colleague next door so Kevin Cody who

26
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,970
just received the black badge he talked

27
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,030
me into submitting up here he's like you

28
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,500
need to come up to besides Pittsburgh is

29
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,250
pretty awesome

30
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,380
so I had gone with him - besides

31
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,000
Knoxville because I'm from Chattanooga

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,520
so he was kind of in my territory so I

33
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,110
decided to try and come up to his

34
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:31,729
territory

35
00:01:31,729 --> 00:01:34,650
so we somehow ended up with dueling

36
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,200
opening talks where he's got the other

37
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,060
room and I've got this one so I told him

38
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,380
I was gonna take a picture of everybody

39
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,390
and then we were gonna count how many

40
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,799
seats are left because he said I had an

41
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,200
unfair advantage because I had 150 seats

42
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,390
and he only had a hundred so I said fine

43
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,250
we'll just count how many empty seats

44
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,200
there are and we'll see who was closer

45
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,740
to capacity so what I'm gonna talk about

46
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,340
today is there's a lot learned from

47
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,520
dealing with the open data call with OS

48
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,729
top ten and unfortunately only a tiny

49
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,770
fraction of what you can learn from the

50
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,870
data is actually in the top ten document

51
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,010
itself

52
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,319
so I wanted to go through and try and

53
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,239
help people understand and some other

54
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,739
information you can learn from that

55
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,500
because we ended up collecting one of

56
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,340
the largest open public data sets about

57
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,260
vulnerabilities found in applications

58
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,540
that I've ever seen and I'm not sure

59
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:35,040
there's a bigger one than this set so OS

60
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,590
top ten how many people know is actually

61
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,950
released in those three much fewer hands

62
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,650
so most people know the top ten as like

63
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:46,800
a three year cycle oh four oh seven ten

64
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,340
thirteen they were too busy on sixteen

65
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,519
so it bled in the 17 and then all sorts

66
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,110
of fun stuff started but it actually

67
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,720
started in 2003 and it was actually

68
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,090
intended to be an annual document and

69
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,590
then when they went through the second

70
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,150
revision they're like that's a little

71
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,400
bit much let's like push it out to about

72
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,209
three years so it's it's an awareness

73
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:12,209
document that's what its intent was is

74
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:14,610
basically at the start of app sack when

75
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,290
it was really getting going in the early

76
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,840
2000s people are like what do i what do

77
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,109
I do

78
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:21,320
I just don't know where to start and so

79
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,640
Jeff Williams and Dave Ricker's were

80
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,609
like let's give people ten things to

81
00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:28,049
start with everyone likes a top ten list

82
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:30,959
right David Letterman's top ten which I

83
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,730
should add in here at some point but

84
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,790
haven't gotten around to it so it's just

85
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,120
awareness and then it got added the PCI

86
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,329
and so awareness went to baselined

87
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:44,100
and then vendors were like we need

88
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,170
something that's measurable that people

89
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,790
have heard of and guess what we're gonna

90
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,519
pick the top ten and so now it's

91
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:54,209
essentially the pseudo de-facto sort of

92
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:57,630
tongue-in-cheek standard of sorts when

93
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,340
the intent was that it's just for

94
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,840
awareness to help you understand where

95
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,880
to start and not I've heard people say

96
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,440
yeah I have a whole app sect program

97
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,290
it's it's the top ten like that's that's

98
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,600
a fraction of a knapsack program that is

99
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,470
not a whole program so like I said the

100
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,900
top ten was supposed to go out in 2016

101
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,329
it didn't make it it was a little bit

102
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:22,979
busy so in April of 2017 they released

103
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:25,260
the release candidate and I don't know

104
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,540
some of you probably remembered too

105
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,890
if you were paying attention to Twitter

106
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:31,740
or wasp there was a lot of backlash and

107
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,600
controversy over the release candidate

108
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,310
for the first round of loss top ten 2017

109
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,540
there are two new categories that were

110
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,400
added one was insufficient attack

111
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,170
protection and the other words under

112
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:46,860
protected api's now neither it's not

113
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,480
that neither of them are actually a

114
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,180
problem it became more that the

115
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,910
community backlash against the way they

116
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,410
got in and more the way they were

117
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:57,780
written because a seven ended up being

118
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,700
more written like you need to buy a tool

119
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:03,540
to solve this and unfortunately there

120
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,570
was connections between the guys who

121
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:07,950
wrote it and some tools they were

122
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:11,010
selling and I don't really know I have

123
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,960
no idea of intentions I'm not passing

124
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,490
judgment on intentions one way or the

125
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,610
other but social media like social media

126
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:20,070
likes to do will absolutely pass

127
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,020
judgment from everybody's individual

128
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,830
phone and laptop and everything so it

129
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,430
got ugly how many people followed that

130
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:34,250
anybody so this is new to you Wow I

131
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,840
guess we live in our little like spheres

132
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,070
of little chasms and such but so I only

133
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:44,100
got tired of this I got four kids I try

134
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,600
and insulate them from social media for

135
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,100
a part but I really got tired of the

136
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,260
security community started tearing on

137
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,720
each other and they started tearing on

138
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,810
ooohs over the whole thing so I got

139
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,640
tired of everything buddy just saying

140
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,230
burn it to the ground and nobody was

141
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,040
trying to come up with anything

142
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,800
constructive so I wanted to do a little

143
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,590
research because I feel like by if I'm

144
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,450
gonna weigh in on anything I need to

145
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,770
have a background and I need to

146
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:09,600
understand what's going on rather than

147
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,000
just snapping off an opinion and then

148
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,590
finding out that I'm wrong because I

149
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:17,160
didn't know the story so I reviewed the

150
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,660
history of the top 10 development all

151
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,520
the way back to 2003 and I was one of

152
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,260
the people who didn't realize it started

153
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,830
in O 3 but I found that the release

154
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,070
candidate for every cycle didn't change

155
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,720
between the release candidate and the

156
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,510
final for whatever discussions they were

157
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,640
had sometimes there was some discussion

158
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,670
sometimes not it never changed and so

159
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,140
that became concerning on its own

160
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,280
because at that point

161
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,320
said the process is whatever the release

162
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,110
candidate came out with it was basically

163
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:48,000
gonna be the same thing at the final one

164
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,290
year they flipped a couple of them

165
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,669
around but they didn't actually change

166
00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:53,669
what the categories were so then because

167
00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:55,860
the data was all public I decided to do

168
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,600
some analysis of the data and see if it

169
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,370
backed up what was in there trying to

170
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,020
figure out get to the root of all of

171
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,600
this and then for better or worse I

172
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,419
wrote two blog posts on it one was more

173
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:10,710
about the process in trying to plead

174
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,870
with people to stop just ripping into it

175
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:13,919
and try and figure out something a

176
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,780
little more constructive and the second

177
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,280
one is after I started digging into the

178
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,169
data I got way more curious about what

179
00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:23,400
was actually in the data so the original

180
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,980
data collection they wanted full public

181
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,990
attribution they wanted it fully public

182
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,390
so that meant many contributors actually

183
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:34,020
wouldn't contribute at the time that the

184
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,729
call went out for data I was working at

185
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:38,100
Microsoft's trustworthy computing and I

186
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,419
asked them I'm like hey do you guys do

187
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:41,520
anything with OAuth and they're like no

188
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,910
not really why I'm like your Microsoft

189
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:48,120
we have like massive amounts of data can

190
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,870
we share it like yeah you can try so I

191
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:54,060
put I've talked with a bunch of internal

192
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,220
teams spent weeks on spreadsheets and

193
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,220
calling out stuff for data had over half

194
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,289
a million different findings that they

195
00:08:01,289 --> 00:08:04,169
had found and fixed before ever any of

196
00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:06,360
their apps ever being published and then

197
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,729
in a near the end and execs like nope

198
00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:11,160
can't release it there's like all it

199
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,870
takes is one person to look at that data

200
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,760
and write one blog about how horrible

201
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,710
Microsoft is about security because they

202
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,479
had half a million vulnerabilities that

203
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,200
they found in their own stuff and so

204
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,300
unfortunately that data never made it I

205
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,390
I couldn't do anything about it so what

206
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,580
happens is when you do something at that

207
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,979
full public level the only people that

208
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:33,830
contribute our consultants and vendors

209
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:37,140
because they can bury the actual origins

210
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,690
of the findings in within their whole

211
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:40,799
client base because it gets all

212
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,750
aggregated together you don't know which

213
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,400
client those actually come from

214
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,680
so those end up being the only people

215
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,620
who can really contribute and that's one

216
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,300
thing when when we were working with the

217
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,370
team I was trying to plead with them

218
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:53,880
that

219
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,130
we need a better way to do that we need

220
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:59,220
some pseudo public some way to be able

221
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,839
to contribute data with each other

222
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:02,579
because better right now everybody's

223
00:09:02,579 --> 00:09:04,709
learning stuff and then we don't get to

224
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:06,660
share it with anybody relearn the same

225
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,100
things over and over and over and it's

226
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:13,560
ridiculous so looking at the the initial

227
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,329
data set I realize there's there's

228
00:09:15,329 --> 00:09:17,310
really two patterns you have human

229
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,920
augmented tools and tool augmented

230
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,889
humans they're a little awkward but you

231
00:09:22,889 --> 00:09:25,740
know so it comes down the frequency of

232
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,949
findings so if you look at have you ever

233
00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:30,959
gotten the report for that's generated

234
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,880
off of a tool vendor versus a report off

235
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,980
of a human pen tester what's different

236
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:41,220
about them everything so when you ask a

237
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,860
tool to find stuff it tries to find

238
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,380
every single specific instance of

239
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,120
something and will report you every

240
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,329
single specific instance of something so

241
00:09:51,329 --> 00:09:53,250
you get hundreds and thousands of

242
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,529
findings in the tool report so when you

243
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:58,290
get a report from a human you get hey I

244
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,689
found it three times it's pretty

245
00:10:00,689 --> 00:10:03,329
pervasive I can see that you have no

246
00:10:03,329 --> 00:10:05,399
control in your code or no control in

247
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:07,680
the dynamic this is a big problem but

248
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,089
I'm not going to find you every single

249
00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:13,529
one of them so then there's context like

250
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:16,579
humans understand context tools do not

251
00:10:16,579 --> 00:10:19,019
so I worked at FedEx for about a decade

252
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:22,319
as both developer and security and we

253
00:10:22,319 --> 00:10:23,759
would run security tools against the

254
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:26,639
code and bless its heart it was one of

255
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:28,829
the better dynamic web scanners at the

256
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:33,089
time and almost every app it would find

257
00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:35,819
a multitude of social security number

258
00:10:35,819 --> 00:10:38,370
exposures anybody want to hazard a guess

259
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:45,209
why so social security numbers are nine

260
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:48,300
digit numbers right so what else for a

261
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:52,069
shipping company is a nine digit number

262
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:56,300
is it plus four yes so without knowing

263
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:00,240
context the tool has to say I don't know

264
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,560
but it could be a social security number

265
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,410
it's nine digits so but I can't tell you

266
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:07,050
that it's like after a city-state

267
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:09,060
therefore most likely zip code but human

268
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,170
will tell you that in this heartbeat

269
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,150
well know exactly that you're looking at

270
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,940
a zip code the other thing comes into is

271
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,740
natural curiosity how many people have

272
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,180
found the tool that's curious

273
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,730
it actually wanders around out of

274
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,530
curiosity and says hey that's a that

275
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:25,350
looks weird let me poke that let me fuzz

276
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,820
that let me put something else in there

277
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,700
tools don't do that they do exactly what

278
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,710
you tell them to sometimes most of the

279
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:34,980
time hopefully they do exactly what a

280
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,540
developer told them to whether or not

281
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,950
they realized they were telling them to

282
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,530
do that but on the other end of the

283
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:44,250
scale humans don't scale human the

284
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,020
scalability tools you can point at

285
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,810
something and they will work 24/7 they

286
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:51,720
will work for as many as much

287
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,110
electricity or CPUs or disk space you to

288
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,930
give them humans nope we need a break

289
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:01,200
and then consistency so as much as I

290
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,510
hate to say this if you get a pen test

291
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,190
from the same company over and over and

292
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:06,270
you get different people they're gonna

293
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,730
find different things humans aren't

294
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:11,010
consistent in that space we all have

295
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:13,080
patterns that we like to follow we have

296
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,290
different areas of expertise but a tool

297
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:18,810
it should find the same thing over and

298
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:23,190
over again and in the same space so one

299
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,840
of the things like I split up the data

300
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,580
and at the top you can look there are

301
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:31,650
various you can see very clearly the

302
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,330
average per app the second of the last

303
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:36,930
column going at 212 findings per app do

304
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,960
you think a human wrote that report like

305
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:46,350
no need not 61 not 49 there's one in

306
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,630
there at 17.3 but they identified

307
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:51,320
themselves as being pure raw untreated

308
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,850
output from a tool that had nothing to

309
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:56,670
do with humans but then you get down you

310
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,230
get down to 15 and less and that's

311
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:01,140
definitely a sign that you know a human

312
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,360
is doing it and so that's where the the

313
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,250
tool augmented humans come into play so

314
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,710
so I wanted to see I'm like alright so

315
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:13,440
we're playing with this what are humans

316
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,740
good at finding versus tooling and so I

317
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,480
broke it down as like hey of all of the

318
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,279
findings that were identified

319
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:21,810
what are the machines good at finding

320
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,430
versus the humans and anything in

321
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:28,189
orange-ish color the humans were like

322
00:13:28,189 --> 00:13:31,560
70% or better of the findings anything

323
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,470
in gray which is almost everything else

324
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,629
the tools were better at finding but

325
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:39,329
then I realize there's a small problem

326
00:13:39,329 --> 00:13:40,529
with looking at it that way and that's

327
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:44,160
frequency tools are finding a lot more

328
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,439
and the original data collected for the

329
00:13:46,439 --> 00:13:49,290
top ten was based on frequency so I said

330
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,839
alright so looking at the top the humans

331
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,110
and machines are quite nicely almost

332
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:57,990
exactly tenfold different so I'm like

333
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:00,209
alright let me let me just pretend for a

334
00:14:00,209 --> 00:14:04,079
minute I got 10 times as many humans and

335
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,490
let me try and level the playing field

336
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:08,459
and say hey we we tested the same number

337
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:12,300
of apps it changes all of a sudden you

338
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,189
realize the scalability problem and

339
00:14:14,189 --> 00:14:15,959
humans are actually decent bit better

340
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:17,850
than tools still at finding stuff we

341
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,470
just don't have the time to find

342
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,600
everything we need to find we're writing

343
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,939
way too much software way too fast for

344
00:14:23,939 --> 00:14:25,379
the number of people to be able to find

345
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:29,399
stuff in it so all of a sudden you the

346
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:31,550
chart flips and you've got stuff that

347
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:35,250
humans like almost exclusively find over

348
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:39,750
tools if you could scale them so then we

349
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,399
have the chart that I like to call the

350
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:43,860
pac-man effect and that usually happens

351
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,360
when you decide to make a pie chart with

352
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,980
something one single thing having at

353
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,959
least 80 some percent and then you tilt

354
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,629
it on the side so it looks like pac-man

355
00:14:50,629 --> 00:14:55,709
uh-huh the original data had was very

356
00:14:55,709 --> 00:14:58,350
much overwhelmed by very code very code

357
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,389
was kind enough to submit data but the

358
00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:02,699
thing was is their individual data

359
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:06,899
submission comprised these some percent

360
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:09,660
of all of the initial data and so

361
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,329
whatever they found drowned everything

362
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:14,399
else out at the time especially in

363
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,839
frequency and guess what they found

364
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,120
quite frequently cross-site scripting

365
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,459
what's been number one on the top 10 for

366
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:23,939
forever cross-site scripting so I was

367
00:15:23,939 --> 00:15:25,230
curious I'm like so what happens if

368
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,939
humans look at this and it's a very much

369
00:15:26,939 --> 00:15:29,250
more diverse lot when humans try and

370
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,160
find stuff within an application

371
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,209
actually the interesting thing is

372
00:15:33,209 --> 00:15:34,140
cross-site scripting

373
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:37,020
number three number one is security Miss

374
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,980
configuration which we'll get to in a

375
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,630
little bit to why that's actually

376
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,490
interesting setup so I went through and

377
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:46,680
I did these blog posts and you know

378
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,980
talked with a few different people and

379
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,590
then have my one transition slide

380
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:54,090
because like my kids snuck spongebob

381
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:58,710
into my deck so it has anybody heard of

382
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:01,880
the summit or the open security summit

383
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,600
okay

384
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,590
is anybody active in a wasp right now

385
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,180
not really interesting okay

386
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:12,240
so Lois has and they did it last year

387
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,530
and they did it this year they have a

388
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:15,690
project summit that's like a dedicated

389
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:18,360
separate summit and it's a week in

390
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,330
London and essentially the project's get

391
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:23,490
together and they just work on their

392
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:25,170
projects it's not a conference there's

393
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:29,040
not talks you have working sessions all

394
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,890
week and yeah honestly we end up working

395
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,840
ten twelve hours for the day because we

396
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,980
go all the way through dinner and such

397
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:40,140
but in June of 2017 I was heading there

398
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,030
because I was one of the co leads for

399
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:45,570
Sam if that's the Software Assurance

400
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:47,880
maturity model so if you're having to

401
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,800
deal with program type stuff and you

402
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,780
need to know where you're at I highly

403
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:56,070
recommend you take a look at Sam but the

404
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:58,290
top ten leadership that's had it from oh

405
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:01,260
three finally decided after fourteen

406
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,500
years or like yeah we're kind of done

407
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,609
this was just too much too much

408
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:08,520
controversy we're gonna turn it over and

409
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,199
they turned it over to Andrew Vander

410
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:13,470
stock who's been longtime ojas he's been

411
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,940
board member he's been working on the

412
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,310
top ten really good guy

413
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,900
I was definitely a pleasure working with

414
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,839
him the top ten had working sessions

415
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,099
there because they were gonna try and

416
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:24,449
figure out what to do with art with the

417
00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:27,750
release candidate so while I was there

418
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,940
they asked if I would help work on the

419
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,720
top ten because little did I know the

420
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,910
data analysis I did for the blog post

421
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:38,070
was more than anyone else had done on

422
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:40,920
the data yet to date so they're like

423
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,390
well since you're so familiar with the

424
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:45,330
data can you help us do this part of the

425
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,840
project

426
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,970
so while we were at the conference or at

427
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:53,450
the summit a new plan was was put

428
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:55,310
forward and we basically said look our

429
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,500
target is to release it by Thanksgiving

430
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,140
of this year but we have a boatload of

431
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,600
work to do before then and the data is

432
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,850
not a lot and we actually need it better

433
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:10,460
so but we also we didn't disagree with

434
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:13,060
the original intent of trying to have a

435
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:17,690
couple of a couple of new categories

436
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:19,310
within the top ten because if the top

437
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:21,260
ten was only ever built off of data it's

438
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,780
always looking back to a year or two or

439
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:26,450
maybe three so we're like we might need

440
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:28,160
some emerging categories because they

441
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,120
kind of did that with CSRF no7 andrew

442
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,280
added CSRF into the top ten

443
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,040
because from talking with other folks in

444
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,380
the industry they just knew everything

445
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,750
was vulnerable to it we had no defenses

446
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:45,170
for it at that point and it worked it

447
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:47,570
got attention defenses got built CSRF

448
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:49,880
isn't what it used to be in terms of a

449
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,550
risk a lot of languages have stuff built

450
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,860
in by default the same site cookies or

451
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,500
kicking in and so CSRF isn't as much of

452
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,520
a concern as it used to be but we also

453
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,510
changed it to have a fully open process

454
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,910
in github so part of the process that

455
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:11,570
the top ten that had was you just every

456
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:13,190
now and then it would the project would

457
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:15,290
surface with some output but there was

458
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:17,720
no insight into who all was working on

459
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,850
the team who all was doing stuff what

460
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:21,590
decisions were being made what was being

461
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:25,490
discussed so there's Andrew Vander stock

462
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:31,130
and Torsten giggler and Neil O'Neill's

463
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:32,390
going because I can't remember his last

464
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:35,570
name standing up here under lights sorry

465
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:40,820
Neil and myself so and then also being

466
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,070
able to put it in the markdown and

467
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:46,100
github it allowed the top ten is one of

468
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,730
the most translated OS projects and so

469
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,740
it allowed groups to be able to actually

470
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,360
actively translate it so now we have

471
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,700
like Spanish French Hebrew Indonesian

472
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,210
Japanese Korean it's amazing I've

473
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:00,620
actually talked to folks

474
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,750
from France and they basically said if

475
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,430
you can't give their developers stuff

476
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,050
written in French they won't read it

477
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:08,059
they just won't pay attention to it you

478
00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:09,530
can give them English stuff all day long

479
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:11,450
they don't care it's like if it's if

480
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:13,190
somebody translates it to French then

481
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:18,140
they'll read it so we decided to get two

482
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,820
forward-looking categories we would open

483
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:24,290
up a survey it was mostly grassroots

484
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:25,760
over Twitter and everything we would do

485
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,300
a survey I have this slide because on

486
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,280
day one of saying hey we're gonna do a

487
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,960
survey we're gonna survey the industry

488
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,700
everybody who can chime in please do

489
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,520
tell us in and we'll commit to having

490
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,100
two of the categories into the top ten

491
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,350
of course somebody goes and asked within

492
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,970
like six or eight hours hey what happens

493
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:47,120
if someone games the system like thanks

494
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,850
that that's so helpful now everyone now

495
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,650
people are like I wonder if I could game

496
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:54,200
the system so this slides here to

497
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,640
basically show other than the like

498
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,650
initial spike of oh this is interesting

499
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,750
maybe I'll spend time like filling out a

500
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,429
survey of what I think is important

501
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,960
coming up that's not touching the top

502
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,750
ten yet pretty much all the other spikes

503
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,600
in there are only when we went back and

504
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,000
like retweeted again on Twitter or like

505
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,059
hey please fill out the survey so there

506
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:20,000
is no weird anomalous behavior in here

507
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,890
and to be honest it would have been hard

508
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:23,120
to game the system because you didn't

509
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,860
know how many submissions there were so

510
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:27,290
you either ran the risk of being too low

511
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:29,870
and not getting what you wanted or being

512
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:31,670
so ridiculously high that it was

513
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:33,740
absolutely clear that somebody had gamed

514
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:38,330
any particular answer so we were when we

515
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,980
were talking this is a project we are

516
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:42,710
really hoping that we would have one

517
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,720
hundred hundred and fifty responses we

518
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,309
figured if we got to that point we could

519
00:21:46,309 --> 00:21:48,470
at least say this was pretty good we end

520
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,530
up with five hundred and fifty people

521
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:53,030
who were actually willing to go through

522
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:55,490
and fill out the survey to do this

523
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:58,880
influence so the interesting thing was

524
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,210
is so we did it in a ranked set up there

525
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:04,460
anybody here fill out that survey just

526
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:07,370
out of curiosity yes thank you by the

527
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:11,840
way at least one so number one and this

528
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,029
is interesting so exposure of

529
00:22:14,029 --> 00:22:18,019
information so privacy violations so not

530
00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:21,649
really surprised cryptographic failures

531
00:22:21,649 --> 00:22:23,929
is number two so both of those fit

532
00:22:23,929 --> 00:22:26,509
really well into the sensitive data

533
00:22:26,509 --> 00:22:29,809
exposure it was a fine it was one that

534
00:22:29,809 --> 00:22:31,519
we already have so within the top ten

535
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:34,159
each one is essentially a collection of

536
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:39,169
different cwe's number three became d

537
00:22:39,169 --> 00:22:41,840
serialization so that stood out on its

538
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,639
own so that became one of the categories

539
00:22:43,639 --> 00:22:47,749
that was added in 2017 authors a bypass

540
00:22:47,749 --> 00:22:51,440
essentially path traversal insecure

541
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,570
direct object reference so that went

542
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:55,489
into the brokest act broken access

543
00:22:55,489 --> 00:22:58,309
control and then the fifth one on there

544
00:22:58,309 --> 00:22:59,719
was insufficient logging and monitoring

545
00:22:59,719 --> 00:23:02,359
which i found to be quite fascinating

546
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:04,669
that that got identified as a number

547
00:23:04,669 --> 00:23:06,799
fifth most important so that became a

548
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:10,039
ten the one that aim here

549
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:12,440
that I I have a feeling will only

550
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,169
continue to grow is the one right in the

551
00:23:15,169 --> 00:23:18,589
middle the inclusion of functionality

552
00:23:18,589 --> 00:23:20,779
from untrusted control sphere it's

553
00:23:20,779 --> 00:23:23,149
essentially third-party code that you're

554
00:23:23,149 --> 00:23:25,429
integrating into your web app that you

555
00:23:25,429 --> 00:23:29,119
don't control if you think about it that

556
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:31,549
should scare you in some respect where

557
00:23:31,549 --> 00:23:33,320
there is the number of times you have

558
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:37,219
site metrics third-party ads whatever

559
00:23:37,219 --> 00:23:39,559
you basically let them put code in your

560
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:42,440
app that says hey go pull code from some

561
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,309
other server and embed it in the page

562
00:23:45,309 --> 00:23:48,200
that's only gonna get worse and that's

563
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,599
at from my perspective that's something

564
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:51,979
that I'm absolutely keeping an eye on

565
00:23:51,979 --> 00:23:54,009
because I expect that to go up further

566
00:23:54,009 --> 00:23:56,450
it's not being abused like it could be

567
00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:00,440
yet but I'm waiting for it so one of the

568
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,710
big things that we did when we reopen

569
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,839
the data call is we switched from

570
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:08,899
frequency to incidence rate so like I

571
00:24:08,899 --> 00:24:10,639
said we have a big problem of frequency

572
00:24:10,639 --> 00:24:12,259
when you get data from tools and you get

573
00:24:12,259 --> 00:24:14,379
data from humans you can't compare them

574
00:24:14,379 --> 00:24:16,849
because tools are absolutely drown the

575
00:24:16,849 --> 00:24:19,309
humans when you look at frequency so we

576
00:24:19,309 --> 00:24:22,429
looked at different ways that we could

577
00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:24,440
try and compare the two and so we went

578
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,560
into the space of Epidemiology

579
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,870
so part of that's my dad's family

580
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:32,030
practice I grew up with all the large

581
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:34,100
medical terms and everything but

582
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:37,970
incidence rate actually fit what we were

583
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:41,150
doing and that's really looking at how

584
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:44,990
many apps had particular vulnerability

585
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:49,190
types at least one of and so now if a

586
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,810
tool finds cross-site scripting an app

587
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:53,300
it's a 1 if a human finds it it's a 1

588
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,280
they're now comparable you now have

589
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,610
whether or not that vulnerability

590
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:00,830
existed in the app you don't get the

591
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,180
granularity of knowing is this a

592
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:05,090
systemic problem where you never

593
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:07,520
actually designed for trying to defend

594
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,100
against this vulnerability or is it like

595
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,750
a you had the framework and the

596
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,670
developer goofed or they purposefully

597
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:16,730
turned off the control you don't get

598
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:18,650
that but you do get the ability to go

599
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,300
back and forth between a human and the

600
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,450
tool so very code was kind enough they

601
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:26,600
three separate years worth of data is a

602
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,420
ridiculous amount of data checkmarks

603
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,880
chimed in how many people know that

604
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:37,040
fortify is no longer HP just a few so

605
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,900
fortify is actually micro focus now

606
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:44,690
micro focus last fall bought fortify Ark

607
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:48,110
site and a few others from HP so anyway

608
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:51,530
if you see microphone why synopsis

609
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:54,140
contributed bugcrowd contributed they

610
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,420
managed to get it under the wire at the

611
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,730
last minute they had a lot of discussion

612
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:01,190
and my hat's off to them because they're

613
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:04,010
the bug hunting industry right now is

614
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:06,440
incredibly competitive and there is

615
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,510
whenever whenever one of these vendors

616
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,670
contributes this data that there is some

617
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:11,960
risk to their business because that

618
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,760
allows their competitors insight into

619
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,200
some of this data that they wouldn't

620
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,200
have had otherwise so I cannot thank

621
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,600
them enough for being willing to

622
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,490
actually contribute and my hope is it

623
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:24,590
will actually get others to contribute

624
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:27,200
and we can keep growing doing more of

625
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,300
this we actually had data for over a

626
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,160
hundred and fourteen thousand

627
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,070
applications tested which is to me it's

628
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:36,620
just it's astounding so looking at an

629
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:40,580
incidence rate so we try and blow this

630
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,360
up a little

631
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,820
but notice something interesting what's

632
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:47,090
number one now it's security miss

633
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:48,380
configuration it's not cross-site

634
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,010
scripting

635
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:50,570
it's not that cross-site scripting is

636
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:52,580
totally dominated all of a sudden we

637
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,950
have security miss configuration happens

638
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:57,500
in almost 25 percent of the apps tested

639
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,410
in that data set cross-site scripting

640
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:04,510
has almost the exact same incidence rate

641
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:07,190
cryptographic issues information

642
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:10,040
information leakage or disclosure then

643
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:10,970
sequel injection

644
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:13,280
I mean seriously sequel injection ten

645
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,690
percent of the apps tested still have

646
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:16,280
sequel injection how many years have we

647
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,850
known how to not write bad sequel it's

648
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:22,549
been more than a decade and we still

649
00:27:22,549 --> 00:27:25,640
have it in ten percent of the apps but

650
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,919
you know why right because sometimes we

651
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,210
have to write queries that are too

652
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:32,660
complicated for whatever what ever

653
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:36,020
structured setup we have built for the a

654
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:38,990
particular language so if in the names

655
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,760
of backwards compatibility are still

656
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,620
being able to do whatever we need to do

657
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,690
with the data we still get sequel

658
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:48,890
injection unchecked redirect xx e's were

659
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:51,980
kind of surprised that they showed up

660
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:52,940
all of a sudden

661
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:55,100
but looking at incidence rate we all of

662
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,230
a sudden had a very different view about

663
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:59,179
what was actually showing up in

664
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:03,260
applications so all of this is public

665
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:06,049
you can find it in the OS github if you

666
00:28:06,049 --> 00:28:07,400
want to play with it if you want to

667
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,750
challenge it if you want to argue with

668
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:11,900
me about it that's fine I don't mind I'm

669
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,120
not right all the time I like to be just

670
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:18,559
ask my kids but I'm not

671
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,480
but it's interesting when you look at it

672
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,400
this way so I put in these are the

673
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,440
largest contributors so I've got

674
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,169
microfocus checkmarks bugcrowd three

675
00:28:27,169 --> 00:28:30,549
years of very code synopsis soft tech

676
00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:33,110
anything in green means they found at

677
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:36,470
least one in one app it showed up

678
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:40,160
everything in white was nothing so in

679
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,380
that entire data set they never found

680
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,450
that vulnerability once and all the apps

681
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:46,220
they tested so what does that likely

682
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:52,850
tell you they didn't look so one of the

683
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:55,160
biggest challenges I've run into and I

684
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,240
that might when I was working at

685
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,060
Microsoft so I wanted to work there

686
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:02,000
because I was like this is the beginning

687
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,910
of the SDL this is the company that

688
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,620
started all of that this is the company

689
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:10,420
that owns the dotnet framework and so if

690
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,890
anywhere you can actually fix security

691
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:15,770
at the root it would be there so I

692
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,750
wanted to go and learn all that and it

693
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,610
was interesting because we had access to

694
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:22,970
the guys who like wrote dotnet wrote

695
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,980
calm objects who wrote all that kind of

696
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:28,010
stuff even in the Rosalind compiler

697
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:31,520
which is amazing now they said one of

698
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,680
the hardest things was to get these guys

699
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:38,060
to write test cases I said to font to

700
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,460
write a good static analysis test case

701
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:43,070
is exceedingly difficult to actually

702
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,990
understand the language well enough to

703
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:47,390
know well whether or not you actually

704
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:49,340
have a problem at a particular point

705
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:51,170
they said we can't pay these guys enough

706
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:53,720
to do it they know how to do it but it

707
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:57,980
it's just so painful for two having how

708
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,990
hard you have to think about it and how

709
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:02,600
hard it is to get right that that is

710
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,850
where part of the problem is is we're

711
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:06,710
just having a real problem getting

712
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:08,720
people to write the right test cases to

713
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,640
get the static analysis to do what it

714
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,460
needs to do so it's interesting so if

715
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:16,220
you look at like in check marks and I'm

716
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,870
not picking on anybody specifically

717
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:20,900
they're just easier to see from afar in

718
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,450
their data FN occation and security

719
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:26,540
misconfigurations are both zeros so

720
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:29,240
basically they'll never find that right

721
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,460
now now this now I have to caveat this

722
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,350
this was the data set they sent me last

723
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,930
year they may have added tests to that

724
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:38,660
since if you look at vera codes so

725
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,340
there's a very obvious one in the second

726
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:45,320
row down in 2014 and 2015 data they have

727
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,690
zeros in 2016 all of a sudden they have

728
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:51,020
data so somebody wrote test cases and

729
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,730
they started looking for security

730
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:54,020
misconfigurations

731
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:57,290
now when they started looking they found

732
00:30:57,290 --> 00:31:00,320
it in 44% of the apps that they tested

733
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,200
that year which tells me it's been there

734
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,650
it just wasn't looked for and to have

735
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:08,750
security configuration come out

736
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:11,570
as the most prevalent at the incidence

737
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,850
rate and we haven't been looking for it

738
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:15,860
and all of this tells me there's even

739
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,900
more of it out there

740
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,760
so it's interesting because like

741
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,580
sometimes and it's interesting looking

742
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,440
at the tool some tools have more breadth

743
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,810
than others the other challenge with

744
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:31,730
this is its structured by cwe's so

745
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:33,700
putting all of this data together

746
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:36,290
company store it differently

747
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:38,420
some people will actually associate

748
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:41,600
findings with cwe's and some don't so we

749
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,320
ran in the struggles like we even had so

750
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,340
anybody know HP Seven Kingdoms

751
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:52,490
so HP the there guys decided that they

752
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:54,380
weren't really crazy about how cwe's are

753
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,150
structured and to be honest there's some

754
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:58,340
challenges with cwe's it's still one of

755
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,260
the better things we have I'd rather try

756
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,520
and fix it than build yet another

757
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,790
standard like you all have seen the xkcd

758
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,500
cartoon where they're like we have 14

759
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,120
competing standards let's make the one

760
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,430
standard to unite them all and then the

761
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:12,260
next frame we have 15 competing

762
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:16,280
standards too it's like stop making new

763
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:20,180
ones let's fix what we have so HP stores

764
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:22,460
all of its data based on those seven

765
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,850
kingdoms that they do not necessarily

766
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:28,910
cwe's so that's how fortified data is

767
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:31,130
actually collected so when I asked for

768
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:33,680
it structured in cwe's they had to go

769
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,660
through and they had to go try and align

770
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,990
what they had with cwe's and we were in

771
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,450
in this some times where it's like

772
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:43,000
you're your aggregation of all

773
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,500
injections is actually a smaller number

774
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,320
than sequel injection by itself I don't

775
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,270
think you're aggregating worked quite

776
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:52,340
right and so they're like nope you're

777
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,870
right and they had to go back and they

778
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:55,790
had to readjust it so the biggest

779
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:57,440
struggle we have is with there's no

780
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,540
standards for how we're doing this

781
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:02,720
cwe's the closest we can do at this

782
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,180
point but even with cwe's the way

783
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,830
they're laid out you can have overlap

784
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:09,110
and you can have three really smart

785
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:11,570
security people disagree which cwe a

786
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:16,010
problem actually is so let me ask real

787
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:19,880
quick I'm using cwe's as if I'm assuming

788
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,890
you know what they mean does everybody

789
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:22,190
know

790
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:26,269
cwe is generally so you know what CVEs

791
00:33:26,269 --> 00:33:29,000
are right so see v's is that common

792
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,889
vulnerability enumeration so you get the

793
00:33:30,889 --> 00:33:32,570
cool little number when you find a

794
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:34,759
specific vulnerability in a specific

795
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:38,090
piece of software cwe's is abstracted a

796
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:40,370
little bit it's like a common weakness

797
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:43,279
and so it is more in general it's not

798
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:45,110
talking about a specific vulnerability

799
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,519
that was found it's talking about a

800
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:49,610
vulnerability pattern or more of a more

801
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:52,450
architectural or more at a higher level

802
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:55,909
so it's are just aside I realize I

803
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:58,700
forgot that one other thing I wanted to

804
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,409
do is I wanted to look at the data call

805
00:34:00,409 --> 00:34:03,679
results and so I wanted to see what

806
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,360
percentage of all of these people that

807
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,399
submitted actually ever found a

808
00:34:07,399 --> 00:34:09,980
particular vulnerability in an app so

809
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:13,790
like nine ever like in their data so

810
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:16,609
like cross-site scripting is actually

811
00:34:16,609 --> 00:34:17,989
probably one of the easier things to

812
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:21,349
find right now at least one right so

813
00:34:21,349 --> 00:34:23,599
there are some cross-site scripting that

814
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,579
you would have to fuzz for a long time

815
00:34:25,579 --> 00:34:28,010
to actually find some of them but there

816
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:29,540
is some dirt simple cross site scripting

817
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,639
and quite honestly it's like the most

818
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:34,668
commonly used a little pop-up alert box

819
00:34:34,668 --> 00:34:40,550
of hi or 1 or pwned or whatever so but

820
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:42,469
also almost all of the vendors that

821
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:44,569
found sequel injection or path traversal

822
00:34:44,569 --> 00:34:47,719
or security Miss configuration or crypto

823
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:50,300
errors but where we start to struggle is

824
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,550
we start looking at insufficient anti

825
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:55,069
automation less than half of the vendors

826
00:34:55,069 --> 00:35:01,010
ever found it once in any app or xxe or

827
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:03,680
unvalidated for words or unrestricted

828
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:08,540
upload of files so or insufficient

829
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,220
security logging at the very bottom we

830
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:12,710
have less than 20% of the people of the

831
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:16,550
vendors that submitted data ever found

832
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:19,970
that once in that data not like I didn't

833
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:21,859
find it in this app they never found it

834
00:35:21,859 --> 00:35:26,900
once in their entire data set so what

835
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,329
can it tell us it was like humans we're

836
00:35:29,329 --> 00:35:32,690
humans are still winning right I mean if

837
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:34,010
we weren't around nobody tell the

838
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:35,180
machines what to do so

839
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:37,910
I'm not surprised that humans find more

840
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:40,400
diverse philander abilities they just do

841
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,460
we're more creative in that space tools

842
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,260
can find what they know to look for and

843
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:48,170
that's a challenge because it doesn't

844
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:50,750
take much of a difference I mean look at

845
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:53,720
a V and signature chasing and how hard

846
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,790
it is to write signatures for every

847
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:58,010
possible variant of a particular virus

848
00:35:58,010 --> 00:35:59,750
or worm or something I mean it doesn't

849
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:03,829
take much to throw off Chex tools can

850
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:06,680
scale they can scale really well at

851
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,930
times but then I run into the same

852
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:10,339
problem where I'll do different talks

853
00:36:10,339 --> 00:36:12,410
about more about the SDL and people are

854
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:14,210
like my static analysis scanner can't

855
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:17,900
scale for my CI CD setup feel like it's

856
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,640
trying to run static analysis and it

857
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,260
takes it to ours and I need it to be

858
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,359
done in two minutes

859
00:36:22,359 --> 00:36:25,130
was I got there's no solution to that

860
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:26,079
right now

861
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,819
not at that scale but from my

862
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:31,130
perspective we need both we're not at

863
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:32,390
the point where you can just do tools

864
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:34,730
and no humans because you're gonna miss

865
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:37,579
a lot but you can't do humans and no

866
00:36:37,579 --> 00:36:39,799
tools because you're gonna miss a lot

867
00:36:39,799 --> 00:36:41,599
because you can only look at a small

868
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,720
subset of applications and honestly

869
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,720
we're not looking for everything we just

870
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,109
aren't

871
00:36:48,109 --> 00:36:51,140
I mean we're happily ignorant about a

872
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,270
number of things cuz we just we don't

873
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:54,980
have the time we don't have the manpower

874
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,780
to actually look for everything that's

875
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:59,660
out there the more languages we write

876
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:02,210
the more complicated we get the more

877
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:04,069
vulnerabilities we have we just don't

878
00:37:04,069 --> 00:37:06,170
know about I mean look at look how long

879
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:07,730
deserialize ation was sitting out there

880
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:09,530
before somebody realized you could do it

881
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:12,260
in java and then the amazing thing was

882
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:14,420
look how long it took somebody to make

883
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:17,720
that jump from java.net Microsoft sat

884
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,099
there cuz I was there they were like

885
00:37:19,099 --> 00:37:21,500
don't say anything about deserialization

886
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,569
feel like cuz it exists on net but

887
00:37:23,569 --> 00:37:25,190
nobody's made the connection yet and

888
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:28,040
we're fixing it and they basically got

889
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,140
it patched completely before somebody

890
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,309
made the jump and they're like hey wait

891
00:37:31,309 --> 00:37:32,990
a minute what if dotnet has the same D

892
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:35,329
serialization problem it was like a year

893
00:37:35,329 --> 00:37:38,839
between Java and.net for talking about

894
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:42,859
it it was amazing so what can the day to

895
00:37:42,859 --> 00:37:45,980
not tell us so right now this is

896
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,839
difficult because we don't store this I

897
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:48,859
work for consultancy

898
00:37:48,859 --> 00:37:50,299
we don't store this because it's too

899
00:37:50,299 --> 00:37:52,670
hard to actually capture this apps are

900
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,799
so complicated and convoluted now I'm

901
00:37:54,799 --> 00:37:56,809
looking at like ten twelve fourteen

902
00:37:56,809 --> 00:37:58,789
different programming languages within

903
00:37:58,789 --> 00:38:01,640
the same app trying to identify which

904
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,339
language of inversion and framework that

905
00:38:04,339 --> 00:38:06,019
we actually found a vulnerability in to

906
00:38:06,019 --> 00:38:08,059
try and attribute to that is like

907
00:38:08,059 --> 00:38:12,410
ridiculously hard so what I would love

908
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:14,359
to know is I would love to know which

909
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:15,559
language or framework is more

910
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:18,079
susceptible to what types we know there

911
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:19,670
are certain frameworks that have more

912
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:21,319
default controls in place where

913
00:38:21,319 --> 00:38:23,210
developers are less likely to run into a

914
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:27,259
problem but we have some that are far

915
00:38:27,259 --> 00:38:29,539
more susceptible PHP is more susceptible

916
00:38:29,539 --> 00:38:31,400
to certain types of vulnerabilities than

917
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,380
that it's just the way the language of

918
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:36,259
the framework is written our problem

919
00:38:36,259 --> 00:38:37,940
like I said incidence rate hides this

920
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:41,089
our problem systemic or one-off that can

921
00:38:41,089 --> 00:38:42,799
make a really big difference because

922
00:38:42,799 --> 00:38:44,359
when you're looking at remediation or

923
00:38:44,359 --> 00:38:46,009
trying to fix something it's a big

924
00:38:46,009 --> 00:38:48,170
difference between oh I goofed and I

925
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:50,119
accidentally made this true instead of

926
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:52,549
false or I didn't use the right method

927
00:38:52,549 --> 00:38:54,739
here it's a big difference in the time

928
00:38:54,739 --> 00:38:56,539
it takes to fix that versus the time it

929
00:38:56,539 --> 00:38:57,950
takes to reaaargh attack something

930
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:59,869
because you never even considered having

931
00:38:59,869 --> 00:39:02,349
to put that control in place is

932
00:39:02,349 --> 00:39:05,089
developer training effective it's kind

933
00:39:05,089 --> 00:39:06,950
of a pet peeve to me really good at

934
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:09,079
developers by using multiple choice do

935
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:10,369
you know what developers are really good

936
00:39:10,369 --> 00:39:13,640
at seeing multiple choice but it has

937
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:16,460
zero bearing almost zero bearing I'm

938
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:18,920
sure there's gonna be some but almost

939
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:22,339
zero bearing on how secure the code is

940
00:39:22,339 --> 00:39:25,190
at your company after the training the

941
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,690
problem is is it takes a certain level

942
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:29,450
of effort to actually understand that

943
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,910
correlation between developers take in

944
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:33,380
the class let's look at the code they do

945
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:36,230
over time beyond that class do we see

946
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:39,319
changes in what's introduced some of it

947
00:39:39,319 --> 00:39:40,279
is we just haven't built the

948
00:39:40,279 --> 00:39:41,779
infrastructure to do it and some of it

949
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:43,160
is there some companies are like we're

950
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,989
not gonna play the blame game we're not

951
00:39:44,989 --> 00:39:47,269
gonna identify which developer actually

952
00:39:47,269 --> 00:39:49,940
did which vulnerability so I mean

953
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,680
wouldn't you kind of want to know at

954
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,279
times right so I mean not not the single

955
00:39:55,279 --> 00:39:57,470
a mountain fire them be like dude you

956
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:59,329
kind of keep writing some nasty dynamic

957
00:39:59,329 --> 00:40:00,650
sequel queries can we help you out with

958
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:02,390
that

959
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:04,530
maybe they got assigned all the

960
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:06,900
requirements for the nasty sequel stuff

961
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,380
where they have no choice but to do that

962
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:12,690
our IDE plugins effective there's an

963
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:14,730
interesting point right so if you get to

964
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:16,650
a developer while they're in the mindset

965
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:18,570
of writing code and you can say hey by

966
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:20,250
the way I don't think you really want to

967
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:20,760
do that

968
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,190
right then and there they can fix that

969
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:26,100
and then like really quick within a

970
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:29,220
minute or two if you wait - that gets

971
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,440
published to production and then you're

972
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,530
like hey by the way good job hashing

973
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:36,390
everything with sha-1 but the company's

974
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:38,160
standard is sha-256 you can have to go

975
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,590
back and change that it's like how much

976
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:42,930
more time is it to go back make that

977
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:44,910
change do the regression testing revert

978
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,890
a bunch of hashes or not or migrate

979
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:48,300
users of everything that was hashed

980
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,880
versus at the moment of time of typing

981
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,870
sha-1 it says no there's a huge

982
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,400
difference the amount of time that costs

983
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,820
you to fix the other thing I have no

984
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,500
information on or how unique these

985
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,660
findings are they gave me a number of

986
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,730
apps and they gave me number of findings

987
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:07,920
in terms of incidents but I have no idea

988
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,180
how many apps are in there more than

989
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,910
once I don't know how often I mean

990
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:16,230
because like in vericose 74,000 I just

991
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:19,260
don't know how many times the same app

992
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:22,350
was retested over and over I just don't

993
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:25,320
have that level of granularity the other

994
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:28,740
thing I had this fleeting thought and

995
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:32,070
now I've lost it Oh bug crowds data is

996
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:35,130
fascinating it was all human generated

997
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:37,470
and human verified right so of all of

998
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:39,780
the data set we had of the ones that

999
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,340
people claimed that they had verified

1000
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,920
and vetted and all of that jazz bug

1001
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,570
crowds people paid money for it because

1002
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:50,190
they paid out the bounty this was all

1003
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:51,990
confirmed bounties that they pay so this

1004
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:54,390
should be the most accurate data guess

1005
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:55,680
what I can't really get out of an

1006
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,220
incidence rate because incidence rate

1007
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,770
requires you knowing how many apps you

1008
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:03,990
tested bug crowds like we can't tell you

1009
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:05,640
how many apps these people tested we can

1010
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,380
only tell you what they reported on we

1011
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:10,200
can't tell you what they tested and so

1012
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,910
it became a different kind of a problem

1013
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:13,680
or you're like this is my most accurate

1014
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,680
data set but I don't know

1015
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:19,880
the scope and so it's like it do trying

1016
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,500
to do this with data is incredibly

1017
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,829
challenging we're still part of the

1018
00:42:24,829 --> 00:42:26,270
picture and that has to do is we're not

1019
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:29,390
testing everything we don't really know

1020
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:31,720
what we're looking at half the time so

1021
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,490
the numbers in this don't matter I just

1022
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:36,829
used it to build a pattern because I

1023
00:42:36,829 --> 00:42:40,490
wanted to show you this so data in prod

1024
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:42,500
versus testing so this is kind of

1025
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,180
something you would kind of want to

1026
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:47,119
expect to see so you start where you're

1027
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:47,839
not looking

1028
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:49,550
you're blissfully ignorant you know

1029
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:52,640
stuffs there but I just don't have the

1030
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,349
resources to deal with it's fine' gonna

1031
00:42:54,349 --> 00:42:56,809
look so you start looking so you get

1032
00:42:56,809 --> 00:42:58,520
this really nice deep cliff you

1033
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,230
implement some testing within your

1034
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:02,750
lifecycle and all of a sudden you have

1035
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,900
this massive amount of vulnerabilities

1036
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:07,010
technical debt and whatever people like

1037
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:08,839
to call it so you get to work on it you

1038
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:11,420
send people to training you're getting a

1039
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:14,450
good steady decrease somebody bypasses

1040
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:16,460
the process you get a little hiccup that

1041
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,770
never happens right nobody ever bypasses

1042
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:20,420
the process because you know some

1043
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:21,950
executives said we need this out and

1044
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:25,760
we're gonna use this cool new tech but

1045
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,950
also the other thing to note is it never

1046
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:31,250
actually hits zero that that's a fallacy

1047
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:33,650
you you will never run out of open

1048
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:36,170
vulnerabilities if you do you probably

1049
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:38,210
have one app and you haven't looked at

1050
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:42,290
everything just don't expect it it needs

1051
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:44,750
to be manageable I mean we're we're in

1052
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,700
the business for security of managing

1053
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:49,040
risks not eliminating risk eliminating

1054
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,510
risk is way too expensive for the

1055
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:53,869
business and as much as it pains me to

1056
00:43:53,869 --> 00:43:56,150
say as a security guy every dollar spent

1057
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:57,770
on security as a dollar not spent on the

1058
00:43:57,770 --> 00:44:00,740
business so when you're looking at

1059
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:02,780
security you better be darn sure you can

1060
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:04,339
sell them that this is worth the money

1061
00:44:04,339 --> 00:44:08,420
that they're putting into it so if you

1062
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:10,549
look at defects and testing now notice I

1063
00:44:10,549 --> 00:44:11,660
didn't call these vulnerabilities I

1064
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:13,819
called these defects because these are

1065
00:44:13,819 --> 00:44:15,020
things that have yet to be released

1066
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:17,359
there's stuff you're finding and you're

1067
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:20,119
fixing before they ever get published so

1068
00:44:20,119 --> 00:44:23,510
you have a similar large climb and spike

1069
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:27,109
but I expect you just sit more in the

1070
00:44:27,109 --> 00:44:28,790
middle and you're gonna get spikes every

1071
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:29,329
time somebody

1072
00:44:29,329 --> 00:44:31,400
introduces new languages new frameworks

1073
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,059
new dev teams new apps new something

1074
00:44:34,059 --> 00:44:37,849
right it's not gonna be a steady decline

1075
00:44:37,849 --> 00:44:40,759
it's gonna do this so be careful what

1076
00:44:40,759 --> 00:44:42,380
you attempt to incentivize your

1077
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,950
developers for what you reward them for

1078
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:47,390
everybody remember the Dilbert cartoon

1079
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:49,729
where the pointy-haired boss goes up to

1080
00:44:49,729 --> 00:44:51,109
Wally and says hey I'll give you 10

1081
00:44:51,109 --> 00:44:53,450
bucks for every bug you find Wally's

1082
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:55,940
like sweet and Dilbert comes back he's

1083
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:57,259
like what are you doing he's like I'm

1084
00:44:57,259 --> 00:45:00,019
writing myself a new house and he's

1085
00:45:00,019 --> 00:45:01,759
writing a ton of bug so he can find them

1086
00:45:01,759 --> 00:45:04,880
all for 10 bucks a pop so be really

1087
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,019
careful with you incentivize developers

1088
00:45:06,019 --> 00:45:10,279
for and testers for finding but looking

1089
00:45:10,279 --> 00:45:15,589
at structuring vulnerability data look

1090
00:45:15,589 --> 00:45:17,180
at the what what app is it related to

1091
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:18,440
when did you find it

1092
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:20,539
language or framework what point in the

1093
00:45:20,539 --> 00:45:22,640
process you found this is really

1094
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,359
important

1095
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:25,819
trying to figure out did I find this

1096
00:45:25,819 --> 00:45:28,700
when I was writing it did I find this in

1097
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:31,940
the initial test or in the build or did

1098
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:33,859
the third-party that I'm required to do

1099
00:45:33,859 --> 00:45:36,229
annual pen tests with find it for me

1100
00:45:36,229 --> 00:45:39,529
later in my entire process fail or did I

1101
00:45:39,529 --> 00:45:42,039
not even have a process to find this

1102
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:45,289
before it went to production like I've

1103
00:45:45,289 --> 00:45:46,969
run into problems where like folks are

1104
00:45:46,969 --> 00:45:48,349
like with DevOps they're like hey we

1105
00:45:48,349 --> 00:45:50,029
deploy four times a day if there's a

1106
00:45:50,029 --> 00:45:51,979
problem we'll fix it like that like

1107
00:45:51,979 --> 00:45:53,869
that's cool but if you lost four million

1108
00:45:53,869 --> 00:45:55,369
records out of your database they don't

1109
00:45:55,369 --> 00:46:00,519
come back like that they're just gone so

1110
00:46:00,519 --> 00:46:02,749
knowing when in the process you find

1111
00:46:02,749 --> 00:46:05,029
stuff really tells you where you need to

1112
00:46:05,029 --> 00:46:06,890
be looking otherwise like if you only

1113
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:08,209
find it too late

1114
00:46:08,209 --> 00:46:09,619
try and see if you can find something

1115
00:46:09,619 --> 00:46:12,079
earlier the later you find any type of

1116
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:13,999
vulnerability the more expensive it is

1117
00:46:13,999 --> 00:46:17,509
to fix and that's one of the things like

1118
00:46:17,509 --> 00:46:20,059
and it's sorry well the next slide is

1119
00:46:20,059 --> 00:46:23,259
good for soapboxing that oh wait so

1120
00:46:23,259 --> 00:46:27,199
again with CBS CBS and cwe's how many

1121
00:46:27,199 --> 00:46:31,549
people know CW SS actually exists like

1122
00:46:31,549 --> 00:46:35,269
one two okay so Steve OSS is really cool

1123
00:46:35,269 --> 00:46:38,059
it's like CBS s right so you're CVE gets

1124
00:46:38,059 --> 00:46:40,759
a particular rating of severity based on

1125
00:46:40,759 --> 00:46:43,000
all the known

1126
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,250
components related to it because you

1127
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:48,020
know of a specific instance within

1128
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:51,260
specific software CW SS is its Big

1129
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:54,290
Brother it's the same idea but it's for

1130
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:57,050
common weaknesses and many ways actually

1131
00:46:57,050 --> 00:47:00,140
like C WS s better than CBS s it's just

1132
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:02,600
nobody's ever heard of it it's amazing

1133
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,250
it's it's out there and it's been out

1134
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:05,570
there for a while but it was never

1135
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:08,660
really published so one of the things

1136
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:10,610
I'm doing in my doodles of spare time

1137
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:13,150
with four kids in the consulting gig oh

1138
00:47:13,150 --> 00:47:16,400
he's trying to build some default CW SS

1139
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,830
scores for did common cwe's because they

1140
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:20,780
just don't exist nobody's actually gone

1141
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:23,990
through and written them yeah and then

1142
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:25,430
the last in the data structures is

1143
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:28,040
verified especially if it comes from a

1144
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,990
tool did somebody come and verify it or

1145
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:33,680
was it just found was it triage did it

1146
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:39,320
really exist so I mean when you look at

1147
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,760
different things and like I said each of

1148
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,920
the vendors gave me different stuff and

1149
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,270
they look different and they smell

1150
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:46,040
different we tried to structure them but

1151
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:49,220
it's a challenge it really is and it's

1152
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:51,470
really hard to do data analysis without

1153
00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:53,810
clean data and that's one thing that a

1154
00:47:53,810 --> 00:47:56,780
lot of a lot of times people won't say

1155
00:47:56,780 --> 00:48:00,290
outside of like inner circles is without

1156
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:02,750
clean data you're not going to get

1157
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:04,550
accurate analysis you're gonna end up

1158
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:06,140
with the wrong solutions and the wrong

1159
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:12,020
answers so this is why I was gonna get

1160
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:15,560
into a loop for a minute there's a

1161
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:18,620
difference between architectural flaws

1162
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:22,910
and valen so an architectural flaw is

1163
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:24,890
when you've messed up in the design you

1164
00:48:24,890 --> 00:48:26,480
either didn't put the control in the

1165
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,590
right place you didn't even put the

1166
00:48:27,590 --> 00:48:31,040
control in place those I've never seen

1167
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,660
anybody who can code their way out of a

1168
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:35,870
bad design you just can't really do it

1169
00:48:35,870 --> 00:48:38,090
one of the stories Microsoft liked to

1170
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:38,990
tell when they first started

1171
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:40,400
implementing threat modeling is in

1172
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,270
Windows 7

1173
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:44,360
they had a feature that like some admins

1174
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:47,090
had asked for or at least voice of the

1175
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,770
customer people said admins had asked

1176
00:48:48,770 --> 00:48:49,070
for

1177
00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:50,420
so they started threat modeling this

1178
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:51,680
feature and they went through what all

1179
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,180
the controls need to be put in place to

1180
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,220
keep this feature from being abused

1181
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:57,920
by the time they were done the only

1182
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,420
person who could actually use the

1183
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:01,640
feature and he benefit out of it was the

1184
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:04,369
attacker because it was just something

1185
00:49:04,369 --> 00:49:06,200
that never should be written there was

1186
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,359
no way to protect it from malicious use

1187
00:49:08,359 --> 00:49:10,490
and so they cited that for a while

1188
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:12,470
because they're like we just through

1189
00:49:12,470 --> 00:49:14,089
threat modeling realized we cannot

1190
00:49:14,089 --> 00:49:16,819
actually code this feature they're like

1191
00:49:16,819 --> 00:49:18,349
just think about what would happen if we

1192
00:49:18,349 --> 00:49:19,970
hadn't done it rewrote the feature we

1193
00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:21,859
released it as part of Windows 7

1194
00:49:21,859 --> 00:49:25,310
and we had how many hundreds of million

1195
00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:27,619
deploys and then found out how bad this

1196
00:49:27,619 --> 00:49:31,910
was and how badly it could be abused so

1197
00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:33,319
think about it it doesn't require

1198
00:49:33,319 --> 00:49:36,319
massive like days worth of work but just

1199
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:37,970
every time you start to put a feature

1200
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:40,730
and be like if I wanted to Beus this

1201
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:42,950
feature how could I abuse it and what

1202
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:44,359
would I need to put in place that's

1203
00:49:44,359 --> 00:49:46,369
reasonable to try and keep people from

1204
00:49:46,369 --> 00:49:50,510
abusing this feature applying secure

1205
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:53,030
design principles I was at a developer

1206
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:56,960
conference last week and I asked him I

1207
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,369
had a room of like 80 people and like

1208
00:49:58,369 --> 00:50:00,200
80% of them are developers and I said

1209
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,780
how many of you know of a security

1210
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:04,609
standard that you're held against like

1211
00:50:04,609 --> 00:50:06,050
does your company have security

1212
00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:11,569
standards six six hands raised out of 60

1213
00:50:11,569 --> 00:50:15,230
some people there's like if if your dev

1214
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:18,319
teams don't know what's expected of them

1215
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:20,270
related to how old a write secure

1216
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:22,760
software you cannot expect them to write

1217
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:25,670
secure software they're getting tested

1218
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:27,349
against something at the end of the day

1219
00:50:27,349 --> 00:50:28,970
when a pen test that they never knew

1220
00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:31,550
they were supposed to do it's kind of

1221
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:33,109
like that nightmare right when you were

1222
00:50:33,109 --> 00:50:34,640
a kid you have that nightmare you're

1223
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,020
sitting in class you're your underwear

1224
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:37,550
and you're taking a test that you've

1225
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:39,290
never studied for you don't know what

1226
00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:44,030
you're looking at and then if we start

1227
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:45,650
looking at data is like what about

1228
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:47,270
training data and I count a hit on this

1229
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:49,400
a little bit before is like how are you

1230
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,319
measuring training are you simply

1231
00:50:51,319 --> 00:50:53,390
measuring it by attendance are you

1232
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:55,010
measuring it by like little

1233
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:57,079
multiple-choice quizzes before and after

1234
00:50:57,079 --> 00:50:59,540
are you actually trying to correlate

1235
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:02,690
data from training with it vole nur

1236
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:04,730
abilities found within your testing

1237
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:09,079
cycles can you create some link between

1238
00:51:09,079 --> 00:51:11,419
can you track it down to individual

1239
00:51:11,419 --> 00:51:13,609
teams or individual people in terms of

1240
00:51:13,609 --> 00:51:16,429
you know knowing where problems are and

1241
00:51:16,429 --> 00:51:18,619
like I said it's not to like shame them

1242
00:51:18,619 --> 00:51:20,209
or anything but it's like certain people

1243
00:51:20,209 --> 00:51:22,759
just may not grasp certain concepts and

1244
00:51:22,759 --> 00:51:25,789
that's fine but would you not want to

1245
00:51:25,789 --> 00:51:27,199
help them or be able to write more

1246
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:29,630
secure code it's really about how you do

1247
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:33,019
it but also within your own data do you

1248
00:51:33,019 --> 00:51:35,839
know your top ten you know what your dev

1249
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:37,609
teams struggle with in terms of ulnar

1250
00:51:37,609 --> 00:51:39,469
abilities within your company not a

1251
00:51:39,469 --> 00:51:43,219
global super high level loss top ten but

1252
00:51:43,219 --> 00:51:47,929
down to their specific stuff so what can

1253
00:51:47,929 --> 00:51:48,939
you do

1254
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:52,519
so I mean part of it is what story do

1255
00:51:52,519 --> 00:51:54,979
you want to tell and what data is needed

1256
00:51:54,979 --> 00:51:56,899
to tell that story so if you're looking

1257
00:51:56,899 --> 00:51:58,969
at a program or you're looking at trying

1258
00:51:58,969 --> 00:52:00,679
to figure out hey I need some more help

1259
00:52:00,679 --> 00:52:03,619
with insecurity in a certain space you

1260
00:52:03,619 --> 00:52:04,999
need to build the story for that and

1261
00:52:04,999 --> 00:52:06,199
then you need to figure out what data

1262
00:52:06,199 --> 00:52:07,909
needs to exist to tell that story do you

1263
00:52:07,909 --> 00:52:09,829
want to tell how effective training is

1264
00:52:09,829 --> 00:52:11,359
doing then you need to set up the

1265
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:12,919
infrastructure to be able to correlate

1266
00:52:12,919 --> 00:52:16,489
findings from time into matching up to

1267
00:52:16,489 --> 00:52:18,289
what is going on with your training

1268
00:52:18,289 --> 00:52:21,469
program structure your data and keep it

1269
00:52:21,469 --> 00:52:25,130
clean that is so dang hard I mean it is

1270
00:52:25,130 --> 00:52:28,519
meat and potatoes it is just grunt work

1271
00:52:28,519 --> 00:52:31,309
it's it's dirty in the trenches but if

1272
00:52:31,309 --> 00:52:33,049
that's not right you're gonna be telling

1273
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:36,619
your bosses the wrong things you're

1274
00:52:36,619 --> 00:52:42,109
gonna make the wrong decisions but oh I

1275
00:52:42,109 --> 00:52:43,759
think right stories was in there for

1276
00:52:43,759 --> 00:52:46,519
security related stuff when you write

1277
00:52:46,519 --> 00:52:50,139
stories when you're doing user stories

1278
00:52:50,139 --> 00:52:52,549
they just think about it I mean there's

1279
00:52:52,549 --> 00:52:53,959
a difference between writing a story of

1280
00:52:53,959 --> 00:52:57,019
like hey users should be able to access

1281
00:52:57,019 --> 00:53:00,699
their account and download a CSV with

1282
00:53:00,699 --> 00:53:02,659
users should be able to access only

1283
00:53:02,659 --> 00:53:04,579
their own account or one their

1284
00:53:04,579 --> 00:53:06,799
authorized for and download CSV there's

1285
00:53:06,799 --> 00:53:08,359
a big difference between how you can

1286
00:53:08,359 --> 00:53:10,729
code those two just by having a few

1287
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:14,479
different words in that sentence every

1288
00:53:14,479 --> 00:53:15,949
now and then I'll have somebody asked me

1289
00:53:15,949 --> 00:53:18,169
like is it better to have security

1290
00:53:18,169 --> 00:53:20,329
sprints or is it better to have security

1291
00:53:20,329 --> 00:53:22,670
built into each of the different stories

1292
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:24,230
and in general I'll tell you it's the

1293
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:26,180
second one it's built into the stories

1294
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:28,010
if you if you try it because this is

1295
00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:29,780
what happens this is what used to happen

1296
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:32,090
in waterfall of testing we're like we

1297
00:53:32,090 --> 00:53:34,850
can compress testing it's fine we need

1298
00:53:34,850 --> 00:53:36,470
the features in place we'll just shrink

1299
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:38,270
the testing time I'm sure the devs did a

1300
00:53:38,270 --> 00:53:41,570
good job at writing it the same problem

1301
00:53:41,570 --> 00:53:43,370
happens when you have security sprints

1302
00:53:43,370 --> 00:53:45,140
because they're like it's not

1303
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:47,570
functionality or you build a ton of

1304
00:53:47,570 --> 00:53:50,090
functionality and then you decide I'm

1305
00:53:50,090 --> 00:53:51,650
gonna do security sprints to secure it

1306
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:54,470
guess what it doesn't work well you

1307
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:56,810
can't go back and tack it on later it

1308
00:53:56,810 --> 00:53:59,570
doesn't work you can do security sprints

1309
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:00,710
like if you need to at the beginning

1310
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:03,650
build an authorization model or you need

1311
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:05,840
to build authentication chunks or you

1312
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,790
need to build some kind of common

1313
00:54:07,790 --> 00:54:10,010
framework for security controls that's

1314
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:12,080
fine but that's functionality at that

1315
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:14,660
point and it should be its own story but

1316
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:16,490
like I said in general having that

1317
00:54:16,490 --> 00:54:18,320
specific language and your stories makes

1318
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,110
a whole the difference in the world and

1319
00:54:20,110 --> 00:54:22,160
then if at all possible

1320
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,530
try and figure out how to contribute to

1321
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:28,670
the top 10 20 20 like I said I have the

1322
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:30,470
utmost respect for the companies who are

1323
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:33,680
willing to contribute and I hope it only

1324
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:36,590
encourages more to do so because I mean

1325
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:38,270
we're our problems way too complicated

1326
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:40,970
to solve in a ton of tiny silos and

1327
00:54:40,970 --> 00:54:43,640
we'll never actually get it right or

1328
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,980
even come close to getting it right the

1329
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:47,300
fun thing about Security's we'll never

1330
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:48,290
solve the problem

1331
00:54:48,290 --> 00:54:50,720
we will only ever be playing catch-up

1332
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:54,230
with the next tech but we can start

1333
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:55,820
trying to be a little bit smarter about

1334
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:58,310
how we do it and a lot of that has to do

1335
00:54:58,310 --> 00:54:59,480
with being able to actually share with

1336
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:02,150
each other there's a lot of people who

1337
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:03,980
are really afraid of what they perceive

1338
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:07,640
is airing dirty laundry but to be honest

1339
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:11,210
we've got to go somewhere and make some

1340
00:55:11,210 --> 00:55:14,960
progress on that space but that's what I

1341
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:19,210
had so questions thoughts

1342
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:34,180
Oh open documents as a secured container

1343
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:41,630
so some of the I've seen some people

1344
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:44,170
take like the wasp ASVs

1345
00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:45,829
because it's more of the positive

1346
00:55:45,829 --> 00:55:48,650
control side and use that to start

1347
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:51,410
trying to create standards I it's not

1348
00:55:51,410 --> 00:55:54,289
part of this deck I have I do more talks

1349
00:55:54,289 --> 00:55:57,200
on SDLC type stuff standards should

1350
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,049
really be technology agnostic so try and

1351
00:56:00,049 --> 00:56:03,670
stay away from language specific stuff

1352
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:06,380
that's a good question I don't see a lot

1353
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:08,329
of it I there's a lot of companies that

1354
00:56:08,329 --> 00:56:11,180
will make it and then they'll sell it i

1355
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:13,400
waas has some guidance and there's some

1356
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:16,039
if you do some Google searches but

1357
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:18,410
there's nothing like like totally stands

1358
00:56:18,410 --> 00:56:20,329
out to me like this is the best starting

1359
00:56:20,329 --> 00:56:24,230
point it's a challenge it really is when

1360
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:27,049
I was at FedEx it took us four months of

1361
00:56:27,049 --> 00:56:29,180
meeting the team of six of us to

1362
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:31,039
actually create the app set standards

1363
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:34,180
within FedEx

1364
00:56:43,730 --> 00:56:48,240
so it was Web Apps api's all that jazz

1365
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,520
but it was static analysis dynamic

1366
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:53,310
analysis hybrid but you know humans

1367
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:55,710
doing both yeah it had that full set in

1368
00:56:55,710 --> 00:57:01,560
there yes and no some were and some

1369
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:02,040
weren't

1370
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:04,620
sometimes people were willing to give us

1371
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:07,830
enough of metadata to say yes we attest

1372
00:57:07,830 --> 00:57:09,270
that these findings were very right and

1373
00:57:09,270 --> 00:57:13,710
sometimes not so it's a challenge right

1374
00:57:13,710 --> 00:57:20,310
so then how far has verified me so but

1375
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:22,530
yeah I like I said that that's like hard

1376
00:57:22,530 --> 00:57:24,840
part to get clean data to actually get

1377
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,880
to understand what you're actually you

1378
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:35,850
know yes sorry I can't hate security

1379
00:57:35,850 --> 00:57:40,650
misconfigurations oh so that's like so

1380
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:43,200
most tools or most software when you buy

1381
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:46,320
it it's by default configurations just

1382
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:48,150
to get it to work right so you don't

1383
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:50,490
want to get your company around and

1384
00:57:50,490 --> 00:57:51,180
support calls

1385
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:53,550
so like Liferay and a number of other

1386
00:57:53,550 --> 00:57:55,110
like large portals or other things like

1387
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:56,940
that they default to like all the

1388
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:58,440
services are on all the ports are open

1389
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,810
the usernames and passwords or defaults

1390
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:02,760
and easy to understand because it just

1391
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:04,350
needs to work or the customers going to

1392
00:58:04,350 --> 00:58:05,550
throw it away and not do anything with

1393
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:08,700
it so Mis configuration is like s3

1394
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:10,170
buckets that are public that shouldn't

1395
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:13,290
be or you never hardened your software

1396
00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:15,390
or you never change different

1397
00:58:15,390 --> 00:58:17,700
configuration elements it's that kind of

1398
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:22,080
thing that makes sense okay anything

1399
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:25,550
else all right thank you

1400
00:58:25,550 --> 00:58:32,530
[Applause]
