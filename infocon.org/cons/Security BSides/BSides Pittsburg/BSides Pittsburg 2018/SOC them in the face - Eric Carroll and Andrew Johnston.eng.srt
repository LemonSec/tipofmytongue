didn't look at the updated slide deck

22
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,260
but being a DJ I guess I tend to play

23
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,549
Justin Bieber music I thought the

24
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:13,799
conference needed to know so my name is

00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:18,360
of my time doing red team's web

36
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,619

37
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:38,810
into

38
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,940

alright to help us understand why you

44
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,090
guys all chose to attend our talk not

45
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,530
saying but I think the goal track today

46
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:07,239
is a bit overloaded and and better but

47
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:10,729
just just to understand the audience

48
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:12,530
that we have in front of us today how

49
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:15,019
many of you currently work in a sock or

50
00:02:15,019 --> 00:02:17,750
previously previously worked in a sock

51
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,050
please raise your hand

52
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:24,550
all right so quite a lot how many of you

53
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:28,130
currently hold a role in the Red Team

54
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:30,350
side of things or previously held a role

55
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:35,120
in the red team okay how about the blue

56
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:41,239
team okay how many of you currently are

57
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:44,120
not holding a role in the cybersecurity

58
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,690
industry but do this as a hobby on the

59
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:51,110
side or are a current student studying a

60
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:54,620
cyber security degree alright some

61
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:58,299
students in the house thanks for joining

62
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:02,720
all right to outline why Andrew and I

63
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,769
are here so we have experience with

64
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:10,459
socks I've worked in socks previously

65
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:14,540
and Andrews perspective is more from the

66
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,450
the attack side of things from a sock

67
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:20,540
standpoint socks are just another team

68
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,970
in the organization except they tend to

69
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,430
have better computers than than everyone

70
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:29,810
else in the company and the key goal of

71
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:33,410
this this talk today is we're going to

72
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:36,049
get into some technical contents but we

73
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,930
also want to focus you know on

74
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:42,920
non-technical as well doing a pretty

75
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,200
even split of both but we really want to

76
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,750
engage really the the human

77
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:51,920
vulnerabilities that exist within within

78
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,230
a

79
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:57,090
sock or a security program overall as as

80
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:01,170
us and all of you end-users you know are

81
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:05,069
the most vulnerable so we'll discuss

82
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:07,230
some of our experiences from the front

83
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,930
lines being consultants you know what we

84
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,569
see out in the field so we're gonna step

85
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:15,330
into three different scenarios with you

86
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:18,988
guys today so the first scenario we're

87
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:21,870
gonna kick off but we'll get to our

88
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:25,740
disclaimer here first before we begin we

89
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,030
have to give the the usual legal

90
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,100
disclaimer the stuff we're talking about

91
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,900
today represents the sum total of our

92
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,539
experiences we're not talking about any

93
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:35,570
one specific client but rather

94
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,949
overarching or unique problems that

95
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:39,780
we've seen that we think deserve more

96
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,810
attention so yet so the when we

97
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,250
reference a client or say the

98
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,199
organization were really referring to

99
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,630
this case study and not a specific

100
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:52,770
organization we've worked for alright so

101
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:55,800
let's get started first scenario we've

102
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:01,229
titled gods in the sock so a little bit

103
00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:03,539
about gods in the sock so this specific

104
00:05:03,539 --> 00:05:07,680
organization followed a typical tier 1

105
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,039
to 3 model tier 1 being more of the the

106
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,530
isinglass you know the monitoring and

107
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:17,460
detection team members tier 2 being the

108
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,099
escalation point for those tier 1

109
00:05:20,099 --> 00:05:25,349
resources and then tier 2 taking taking

110
00:05:25,349 --> 00:05:28,440
that up to the tier 3 level which is

111
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,260
typically your your forensic analysts

112
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,139
whether that's an internal capability

113
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:36,810
that the organization has or they're

114
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:39,630
leveraging those services externally so

115
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,510
for this particular organization they

116
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,760
had a combination of both so they had

117
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,220
some internal Rancic's capabilities as

118
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,970
well as a managed service for forensic

119
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:54,389
support in addition there is just to

120
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:58,560
understand the organization they had

121
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,810
more senior folks so folks that have

122
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,640
been with the organization for for more

123
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,500
than five years that have been in this

124
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,629
industry for quite some time

125
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:08,869
so have a wide range of skill sets

126
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:12,300
across the spectrum from both a Blue

127
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,199
Team and Red Team side of things and in

128
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:18,149
addition they had some some junior team

129
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:23,159
members that recently came out of

130
00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:25,649
college graduated or went through they

131
00:06:25,649 --> 00:06:28,439
their internal development program to

132
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:33,330
try to build up people internally versus

133
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,399
you know hire from the outside so there

134
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:37,770
was a combination of you know senior and

135
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,709
then junior level folks within this

136
00:06:39,709 --> 00:06:42,769
security program

137
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:46,169
so the real breakdown with this

138
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:48,959
situation is you you have full teams

139
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:51,899
within the sock you know your your your

140
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:53,610
monitoring detection team and then they

141
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:56,939
had Intel and then red team operations

142
00:06:56,939 --> 00:07:00,779
that were focused on performing red team

143
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:04,050
exercises quite frequently up into a

144
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:07,589
weekly or a biweekly basis so there was

145
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:10,469
a lot going on from trying to process

146
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:14,039
you know alerts triage those in addition

147
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:16,860
to keeping up with the red team's

148
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,050
exercises that they were performing so

149
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:21,269
the sock overall was was pretty

150
00:07:21,269 --> 00:07:24,659
overwhelmed wearing you know multiple

151
00:07:24,659 --> 00:07:27,629
hats to support you know the current

152
00:07:27,629 --> 00:07:30,300
initiatives that were going on to keep

153
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:35,240
the network secure some of the outcomes

154
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:40,110
for this specific scenario are as

155
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:40,769
follows

156
00:07:40,769 --> 00:07:44,599
so the suspicious alerts weren't being

157
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:47,159
acted on so as I mentioned there was

158
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:49,860
there was a lot going on between the

159
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,990
sake analysts trying to prioritize and

160
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:54,689
keep up you know with alerts that were

161
00:07:54,689 --> 00:07:56,999
being generated then the security

162
00:07:56,999 --> 00:07:58,979
information and event manager that they

163
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:04,019
had in addition to collaboration

164
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:06,029
communication breakdown between senior

165
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:09,479
and and junior member folks so that was

166
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:12,389
a key point here that the senior folks

167
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:14,430
you know knew the lay of the land they

168
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,829
they knew you know the day-to-day

169
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,830
operations

170
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,800
that necessarily wasn't being passed

171
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,100
down or coached to the junior level

172
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,520
folks there so definitely a concern from

173
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,659
an organizational standpoint and then

174
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:36,110
just from a project perspective things

175
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:39,110
weren't being prioritized the current

176
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,659
staff sock staff members you know

177
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:44,420
weren't aware of you know what to work

178
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,200
on first it was you know purely just

179
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,120
kind of pick and choose if you will what

180
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:55,010
they wanted to do that day you know this

181
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:58,490
is a problem that we see a lot a lot of

182
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,260
the times we'll see socks where

183
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,670
especially the junior members but

184
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,830
sometimes a large portion sock really

185
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:06,410
has never been in serious security

186
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,360
incident or compromised so at the end of

187
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,710
the day they're relying on what they see

188
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:12,680
in the tools and if an attacker is

189
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,540
knowledgeable you know maybe those

190
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,250
alerts don't look as suspicious as they

191
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,690
should you know maybe you file names

192
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:18,920
kind of match up with what they would

193
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,080
expect so if there's not a lot of

194
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,230
communication going on you end up with

195
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,550
Tier one your your people on the ground

196
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:28,070
who might see an alert and it could be

197
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:30,020
indicative of something really bad but

198
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,210
it looks just benign enough that it kind

199
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:34,250
of gets passed on so you need that

200
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,950
collaboration between the two or stuff

201
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,960
gets ignored and really bad things can

202
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:45,500
come all right moving into scenario

203
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:50,870
number two oh no my crown jewels so so

204
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:55,790
this particular scenario had no support

205
00:09:55,790 --> 00:10:00,020
so no buy-in from the executives and in

206
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,880
understanding the the security program

207
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,760
current initiatives so there's really no

208
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,310
no insight into what was going on it's

209
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:08,750
just you know hey we have a security

210
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,660
program so we're good right so that was

211
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,950
one thing we observe with this

212
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:17,170
particular organization in addition to

213
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:20,960
cybersecurity you know wasn't not

214
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,450
everyone was aware of cybersecurity what

215
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:26,090
was going on you know even outside of

216
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:29,060
the executives but in addition the

217
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,640
sensitive data or critical assets you

218
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:31,970
know

219
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:35,259
this organization had when were never

220
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:39,230
really listed out or or prioritized then

221
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,990
and what we need to secure most so

222
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,819
that's an important part that this

223
00:10:43,819 --> 00:10:46,790
organization failed to do never define

224
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,620
you know what the sensitive data was or

225
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,920
their you know highest revenue assets

226
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,949
that they have in addition here they

227
00:10:54,949 --> 00:10:57,709
were limited on resourcing so it's

228
00:10:57,709 --> 00:10:59,620
something we see quite a bit across

229
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,089
organizations is very minimal minimal

230
00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:06,189
staff people are often tasked to support

231
00:11:06,189 --> 00:11:09,949
and wear multiple hats so that's that's

232
00:11:09,949 --> 00:11:14,420
nothing an organization was the same way

233
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:18,800
and they had two environments what

234
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,990
barman was the corporate environment

235
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:24,290
that had security controls in place so

236
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:27,079
they had you know AV anti-malware

237
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:32,120
solutions ids/ips had sim so they had a

238
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,480
pretty good list of tools but the other

239
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,850
environment that was international

240
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:41,360
focused was more dedicated to the the

241
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,720
sales folks and it was like the wild

242
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,379
wild west

243
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:47,329
there was nothing in place no security

244
00:11:47,329 --> 00:11:50,860
controls at all so no a/v nothing it was

245
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,689
you know just kind of fend off yourself

246
00:11:53,689 --> 00:11:54,920
if something happens over there it

247
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,559
happens but our top priority right now

248
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:59,809
is just focusing on the corporate

249
00:11:59,809 --> 00:12:03,139
environment so that was that was a big

250
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,959
concern with this organization you know

251
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:07,579
having two environments like that it's

252
00:12:07,579 --> 00:12:09,829
you know extremely important you know

253
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:12,259
for you to balance and have you know

254
00:12:12,259 --> 00:12:16,129
controls in place on on both sides so

255
00:12:16,129 --> 00:12:19,490
some of the outcomes for this particular

256
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:22,579
organization are as follows so as I

257
00:12:22,579 --> 00:12:24,379
mentioned there was very poor visibility

258
00:12:24,379 --> 00:12:28,069
into the crown jewels one of the first

259
00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:29,839
things when you're developing a security

260
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,540
program or looking to take you know your

261
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,879
security program to the next step you

262
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,350
need to make sure all your sensitive

263
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:38,809
data is defined in addition to having

264
00:12:38,809 --> 00:12:42,199
those controls in place on those

265
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:45,750
critical assets once that is defined

266
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,790
in addition here there was minimal

267
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:50,879
network segmentation or isolation

268
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:53,069
capabilities so as I mentioned the

269
00:12:53,069 --> 00:12:54,509
corporate network you know had some

270
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:56,490
controls in place they were doing some

271
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:59,300
segmentation by VLANs

272
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:03,029
but the the sales network was was

273
00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:06,750
nothing nothing in place there so Andrew

274
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,569
if you could help gauge the audience

275
00:13:09,569 --> 00:13:10,829
with you know what are some current

276
00:13:10,829 --> 00:13:13,139
concerns you sing from the Red Team side

277
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:14,819
of things with with having a network

278
00:13:14,819 --> 00:13:18,449
that's unsecured like that sure so a lot

279
00:13:18,449 --> 00:13:21,329
of organizations obscene they do have

280
00:13:21,329 --> 00:13:24,000
one part of the network that isn't as

281
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,620
secure and it's kind of accepted that it

282
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,689
is that way for operational reasons or

283
00:13:27,689 --> 00:13:30,569
or some other non non technical reason

284
00:13:30,569 --> 00:13:33,269
but it it's a really bad situation to

285
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:34,949
get in because when you have one part of

286
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:37,079
your network that just isn't held up to

287
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:38,660
the the security standards you want

288
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,829
attackers are gonna find that and they

289
00:13:40,829 --> 00:13:42,930
might even find it first and attackers

290
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,879
you you know can live in there they can

291
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:46,500
escalate their apologies and they can

292
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,040
exploit the fact that visibility is poor

293
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,300
work just that you know patches aren't

294
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,069
applied as frequently and then they can

295
00:13:53,069 --> 00:13:54,779
use the privileges they gain there to

296
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:56,550
move laterally into the more secured

297
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,949
environment now of course nowadays you

298
00:13:58,949 --> 00:14:01,019
need to have a tiered defense and you

299
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:03,269
know giving extra security to your crown

300
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:04,649
jewels your most sensitive data and

301
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:07,139
processes that's a great idea but it

302
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:09,449
should never be a question of bad

303
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:11,610
security versus good security it should

304
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,079
be a question of good security versus

305
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:14,939
better security so it's a it's a real

306
00:14:14,939 --> 00:14:16,139
common trap and it's a very dangerous

307
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:20,129
one to fall into all right so the third

308
00:14:20,129 --> 00:14:22,259
bullet here the outcome of that as you

309
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:24,990
guys may have expected was an external

310
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,449
service determined that this

311
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:31,319
organization was indeed compromised via

312
00:14:31,319 --> 00:14:35,220
a vulnerable web server so in addition

313
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:38,250
this organization had skill skill set

314
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:42,360
gap issues so minimal staff in place

315
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,309
therefore you know people wearing

316
00:14:44,309 --> 00:14:46,410
multiple hats to try to support you know

317
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:49,370
everything that was tasks at hand but

318
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:52,529
they just didn't have the skills in

319
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:56,790
place to cover to cover everything so

320
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:59,100
some issues around you know hiring those

321
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:03,600
those critical areas and then focus on

322
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,329
priority prioritizing initiatives that's

323
00:15:06,329 --> 00:15:09,800
something this organization never did

324
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,179
you know it was you know hey I'm gonna

325
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:14,370
come to work and and figure out you know

326
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:17,309
what to do and a lot of that was the

327
00:15:17,309 --> 00:15:20,399
individual kind of choosing that versus

328
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,110
you know leadership you know handing

329
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:24,149
that down so having good management in

330
00:15:24,149 --> 00:15:32,910
place is very important so every once in

331
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:35,399
a while we're asked to do a red team

332
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:38,220
where the goal is specifically to kind

333
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,290
of mess talk and how they operate

334
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:42,509
so to attack not only the members of the

335
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:44,429
sock but also their tooling and show

336
00:15:44,429 --> 00:15:46,350
that successful exploitation could

337
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,000
actually lead to a scenario where the

338
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,620
attackers are able to completely

339
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,230
manipulate and control what the sock can

340
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,850
see and actually how its able to respond

341
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:56,610
to an incident and so we will explore it

342
00:15:56,610 --> 00:16:00,209
a bit in depth so in this particular

343
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,490
scenario we had there was a very mature

344
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:03,240
sock

345
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,709
most of the members had actually been

346
00:16:04,709 --> 00:16:05,939
with the organization for a number of

347
00:16:05,939 --> 00:16:08,040
years and this wasn't even their their

348
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,449
first position so they've they've been

349
00:16:09,449 --> 00:16:10,500
around they've seen a number of things

350
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,509
and they actually had some amazing

351
00:16:12,509 --> 00:16:15,329
tooling and some great documentation for

352
00:16:15,329 --> 00:16:17,790
their newcomers that would explain not

353
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,379
only how they detect things but how they

354
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:20,939
go through the processes and and how

355
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:22,620
they use what they have in order to

356
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,980
investigate and remediate incidents the

357
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,429
problem they had was kind of external to

358
00:16:29,429 --> 00:16:31,170
them and that they were tested way too

359
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:33,540
regularly they were undergoing a full

360
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,459
scope red team so a four to six week

361
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:37,589
engagement every single quarter so about

362
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:39,480
50% of their time they were actually

363
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,939
being actively tested and attacked and

364
00:16:41,939 --> 00:16:44,629
the problem was in addition to these

365
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:47,639
regular assessments they would have to

366
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,860
show at the end of the assessment that

367
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,589
they could successfully detect every

368
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:54,269
single technique that the attackers used

369
00:16:54,269 --> 00:16:55,829
and this came all the way down to things

370
00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:58,230
like domain names or file names so they

371
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,309
had to show that they could cover a

372
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:01,520
hundred percent of what happened

373
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,790
and you know this remediation this this

374
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,859
testing and patching process it was seen

375
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:10,160
as kind of it was problems with the sock

376
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,990
and upper management whereas it was

377
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,089
using red teams as a way to kind of

378
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:16,189
evaluate the performance of the sock and

379
00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:17,929
anytime a red teamer was successful in

380
00:17:17,929 --> 00:17:20,119
any way upper management was doing this

381
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:24,530
as a failure of the sock itself so the

382
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,900
outcome of that was was very negative it

383
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:32,300
didn't create a great environment so red

384
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,950
team members ended up being viewed as

385
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:37,850
this guy and when it came time to

386
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,670
actually talk with these sock members

387
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:42,740
about what we had done and how we moved

388
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,510
through their environment they didn't

389
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,980
see it as a learning experience right

390
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,150
because they knew what was coming

391
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,220
afterwards they saw the red team as

392
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,860
combatants as people doing performance

393
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,190
reviews of how well they were doing and

394
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:56,870
a lot of the more senior members in the

395
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:59,059
sock were really frustrated because they

396
00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:01,250
knew that you know going into all of

397
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,260
their systems and you know putting an

398
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,210
alerts for the domains that a red team

399
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,610
had purchased for an engagement wasn't

400
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:09,380
going to create better security it was

401
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,530
just a complete waste of time and they

402
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:14,780
ended up spending more of their time

403
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,790
doing things like that and implementing

404
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,710
these checks in order to appease upper

405
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:20,360
management than they were doing things

406
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,470
like building out their great

407
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:24,290
documentation or or doing in crea you

408
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:30,950
know additional training alright so we

409
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,780
covered three scenarios with you guys

410
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:36,410
and now the next few slides we're gonna

411
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:38,540
cover you know how do we fix some of

412
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:41,510
these issues that we've mentioned in in

413
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:45,070
the three scenarios that we've covered

414
00:18:45,429 --> 00:18:49,040
so on this slide some signs of an unlock

415
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,440
so many of you mentioned that you

416
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,780
currently work in a saw or have

417
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:56,809
previously worked in a sock so these are

418
00:18:56,809 --> 00:18:58,760
some of the things in those scenarios

419
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,240
that that we have we've observed

420
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,950
corporate politics you know heat huge

421
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:06,530
egos existing so getting into you know

422
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:09,650
the senior versus you know junior team

423
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:13,429
members skill skill set gaps so I think

424
00:19:13,429 --> 00:19:14,990
that exists

425
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:17,080
across the board in all three of these

426
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:21,590
scenarios hiring difficulties so based

427
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,540
on the locations and and where these

428
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:26,570
security programs were they they had

429
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:29,570
hiring difficulties so not able to get

430
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:31,070
you know the key skills that were

431
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:34,460
required to have a successful security

432
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,700
program lack of end-user security

433
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:40,370
awareness so there was no education to

434
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:43,910
end-users us being humans you know being

435
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,230
the most vulnerable you know that's

436
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:47,450
extremely important to make sure you are

437
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,850
educating your end-users quite

438
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:52,640
frequently and then a communication

439
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,580
collaboration break down so a sock is

440
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,260
another team of the organization there's

441
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:00,170
there several teams that comprise a sock

442
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:02,090
so you have your your monitoring

443
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:04,900
detection your eyes on glass your Intel

444
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:08,990
forensics teams data protection teams so

445
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,970
it's important that you guys are

446
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:12,860
communicating and collaborating

447
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,840
effectively across all those teams

448
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:20,169
whether you're junior member or a senior

449
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:24,620
so our top five recommendations keeping

450
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,900
in mind you know we're limited on the

451
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,640
slides here so you know we definitely

452
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,320
could have outlined more than five

453
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,090
recommendations but we at least wanted

454
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:34,820
to to cover kind of our top five out of

455
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:38,510
the three scenarios so politics UG huge

456
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:41,120
egos exist in nearly every organization

457
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,990
that I've been a part of or or assess so

458
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:48,020
do your best to work around those it's

459
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,090
it's nothing new every organization

460
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:52,970
experiences that to an extent but

461
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:54,530
ensuring that that that's not a

462
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:58,100
roadblock or a barrier for for you or

463
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:01,070
your security program making sure to do

464
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,900
your best to work around those and focus

465
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:07,400
on the end goal which is to protect and

466
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,030
secure your your organization next

467
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,679
shadowing is the most important tool

468
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:15,380
take advantage of that so I know when I

469
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:18,620
started my career and many of you in

470
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,110
this audience I've worked with you know

471
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,760
that that's one thing that I always go

472
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,070
back to for the success that I've had in

473
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:28,640
this industry is you know

474
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,440
leveraging the the senior folks and

475
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,090
really learning from them so trying to

476
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,340
absorb as much knowledge as I can about

477
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:37,240
those folks take advantage of that so

478
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,170
what you know whether you're studying

479
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:42,550
for a certification or taking classes

480
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:45,890
for a degree you know once you get out

481
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:48,020
into the corporate world and get your

482
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:51,560
first security position you know learn

483
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,700
as much as you can

484
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:56,390
shadow shoulder surf do all that you can

485
00:21:56,390 --> 00:22:00,740
to to take advantage of that another one

486
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,390
of our big takeaways is that red teaming

487
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:04,040
is a great thing and I'm not just saying

488
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,840
that because I do it all the time it's

489
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,230
it's a great tool and is it's a learning

490
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:11,060
experience but red teaming should be

491
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,390
seen as a way to compare how the

492
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:15,290
organization's current security

493
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:18,020
initiatives line up with reality of what

494
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:21,620
attackers are doing securing a large

495
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:24,340
organization as many of you know is

496
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,570
incredibly difficult if not outright

497
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:30,200
impossible to do perfectly and a red

498
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,510
teaming is just a way to compare that

499
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,760
it's not a reflection on how anyone's

500
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,500
doing or whether or not people are doing

501
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:40,730
their jobs and our fourth recommendation

502
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:43,070
is no matter what team you're a part of

503
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,740
whether you're in the Sauk focused on IT

504
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,780
the infrastructure side or even from the

505
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,980
business side of things

506
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:52,750
know your role and responsibilities so I

507
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:56,180
can't emphasize on that enough that you

508
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,460
know it's important that you know your

509
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,380
swimlanes and stay in those swimlanes

510
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,390
and know you know when to reach out for

511
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:04,910
help or know when to hand things off

512
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:07,250
from an instant responsive perspective

513
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,920
that's that's extremely important that

514
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,930
when you're put in a situation like that

515
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:14,990
where response times are critical you

516
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:17,690
need to make sure that you know your

517
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:20,210
role and responsibilities and you know

518
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:23,930
your co-workers know the same and our

519
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:26,870
fifth and final recommendation which in

520
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:29,590
my opinion is is the most important is

521
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,700
educating your end-users as much as

522
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,190
possible I can't stress this enough

523
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:36,470
I value eight organizations on a weekly

524
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:38,870
basis and this is something across the

525
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:42,170
board that often organizations fail to

526
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:42,429
do

527
00:23:42,429 --> 00:23:46,889
is not only budget put a budget in place

528
00:23:46,889 --> 00:23:51,039
towards this with with training or an

529
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,019
education program internally we're

530
00:23:53,019 --> 00:23:55,169
leveraging a service externally but

531
00:23:55,169 --> 00:23:57,850
making sure to develop you know

532
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:02,070
bulletins or or have an internal

533
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:04,539
capability for end-users to reach out

534
00:24:04,539 --> 00:24:06,970
when they receive you know suspicious

535
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:09,730
emails or maybe it's a social

536
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:13,480
engineering issue but never turned down

537
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,059
away and users for sharing that

538
00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:18,909
knowledge some of the best Intel is is

539
00:24:18,909 --> 00:24:21,249
going to come directly from your end

540
00:24:21,249 --> 00:24:24,190
users within your organization so always

541
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:32,019
encourage that to continue all right and

542
00:24:32,019 --> 00:24:35,019
that that wraps up our presentation like

543
00:24:35,019 --> 00:24:36,399
to take this time to address any

544
00:24:36,399 --> 00:24:40,590
questions that you guys may have

545
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,890
absolutely so purple team collaboration

546
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:52,780
is great so it's for some people that

547
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,070
might not be familiar with the term a

548
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:56,590
purple team exercise is when a red team

549
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:59,200
works hand-in-hand with a blue team in

550
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,610
order to see what's working and what

551
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:02,830
doesn't it's a different set of tactics

552
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,720
in terms of I think the the best kind of

553
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,140
purple teams aren't they don't have the

554
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,460
you know covert quality that a standard

555
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:12,880
red team would have but rather the you

556
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,200
know the red teamers can be installed

557
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,120
inside the sock and it should just be a

558
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,920
matter of seeing what kind of things are

559
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:21,400
alerting do common tactics alert and

560
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,860
also just trying to see how effective

561
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,330
the alerting is you know a lot of tools

562
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:27,130
will say that they will stop all

563
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:28,900
instances of me me cats or something

564
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,970
like that so seeing you know where the

565
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:32,110
where the faults are but it should

566
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,730
definitely be a more collaborative

567
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:36,820
exercise and yeah the the covert aspect

568
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,260
should be scaled down in favor of

569
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,700
generating alerts when they're

570
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:48,460
meaningful any other questions in the

571
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,700
front

572
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,140
you want to I'll take the first half so

573
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,120
as we mention in this scenario we often

574
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,600
see internal Red Team capabilities that

575
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,200
that spend too much time performing Red

576
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,170
Team exercises to wear the soft team

577
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,840
members just can't keep up with with the

578
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,110
findings out of those Red Team exercises

579
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:37,299
so managing day-to-day operations with

580
00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:39,610
you know what they're what they're doing

581
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:42,669
within the sock you know keeping the

582
00:26:42,669 --> 00:26:44,470
monitoring detection you know analysts

583
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,669
in place

584
00:26:45,669 --> 00:26:48,640
there's no time dedicated towards you

585
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,620
know taking action to those files out of

586
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:54,059
those reports so what I often see is an

587
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:56,470
overload to where the red team's trying

588
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:58,419
to share you know their findings to the

589
00:26:58,419 --> 00:27:00,580
sock and the socks just simply can't

590
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,980
manage you know putting the the patches

591
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:06,160
in place you know to cover those gaps

592
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,040
from the findings that were observed in

593
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,429
addition to maintaining you know keeping

594
00:27:12,429 --> 00:27:18,340
the network secure and detecting sure so

595
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:21,429
I think both have their place the you

596
00:27:21,429 --> 00:27:23,230
know the benefit and the main problem

597
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:25,690
with a covert red team is that the

598
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:28,270
attackers are only going to use whatever

599
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:29,919
they need in order to complete the

600
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,630
objective since an objective based test

601
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:32,980
they're not going to touch anything that

602
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,140
isn't directly contributing to

603
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,900
accomplishing those objectives so the

604
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,820
more gamestyle where you know where team

605
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,770
may be aware they have the benefit of

606
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:43,570
attackers don't need to be concerned

607
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:45,700
about being as covert as possible and

608
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,500
they can kind of just test the whole

609
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:51,010
range of things so you know maybe in

610
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:52,750
during the course of a covert red team

611
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:55,030
the attackers wouldn't try to break into

612
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:56,980
or access every single web application

613
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,600
that's hosted internally but that may be

614
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,160
a concern and those should definitely be

615
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,990
tested just like any other part of the

616
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:04,570
internal network so there's definitely

617
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:05,980
benefits in both and I think Eric

618
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:06,549
touched on

619
00:28:06,549 --> 00:28:08,500
it's definitely matter of timing them so

620
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,360
that way there's enough time to respond

621
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,100
because a lot of times the the findings

622
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,320
from either one point to a larger

623
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,920
systemic issue as a

624
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,020
- something that can just be fixed with

625
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:20,690
a patch or some other quick fix so yeah

626
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:23,120
both have their place and I think over

627
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,680
tread teams are great for simulating you

628
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,050
know how or testing how well an

629
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:29,210
organization could respond to a very

630
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:31,220
sophisticated attack group that had a

631
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,870
lot of time and a lot of a lot of

632
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:34,820
knowledge but yeah both definitely have

633
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,140
their place and I don't think an

634
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,030
organization would be complete with just

635
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:40,520
doing one versus the other and just add

636
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,230
on I think the frequency is important

637
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:44,270
too and ensuring that you know the

638
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:46,280
management from the soft side of things

639
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,720
in addition to the management of the red

640
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,850
team's out of things communicate that

641
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:52,220
you know ahead of time to establish a

642
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,230
frequency so doing that on a weekly

643
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:56,150
basis you know is overwhelming to your

644
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:58,790
socks so you know agreeing on a time

645
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:00,770
frame that works best I think is uh is

646
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:06,350
key there sure all right if there's no

647
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,970
other questions I think that wraps up

648
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:09,560
our presentations we have our contact

649
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,420
information here we'll be here

650
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,530
throughout the rest of the day if you

651
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:14,000
guys have any further questions we

652
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,730
appreciate you guys dedicating your time

653
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:18,260
today to attend our talk thank you very

654
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,390
much and enjoy the rest of besides

655
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:25,539
[Applause]
