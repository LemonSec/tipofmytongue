1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,170
up next we have Scott Frank and Lucas

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,730
and they're going to tell us about how

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,500
Automation is hard but it is definitely

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,820
worth it and I tend to agree

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,670
wholeheartedly and their talk is called

6
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,620
RMF and a devops world let's give them a

7
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,070
nice round of applause

8
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:19,870
[Applause]

9
00:00:23,869 --> 00:00:26,340
so there's free beer out there and you

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,590
guys still stayed in here I don't know

11
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:33,450
what that says about you know so well we

12
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,460
get set up it's gonna come up because

13
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:43,530
it's looking for a pasture yeah so the

14
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:48,780
three of us big password there so the

15
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,449
three of us come from a company called

16
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:54,690
concurrent Technologies Corporation near

17
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,699
Johnstown Pennsylvania so not too far

18
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:57,750
from here

19
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,579
CTC is a independent high-tech research

20
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:04,920
and development firm mainly working with

21
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,720
Department of Defense the intelligence

22
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,700
community do a lot of this sort of work

23
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,710
and so you would think that you know our

24
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,270
government is as efficient as they are

25
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,460
right it's all about efficiency with an

26
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,500
increment you know yeah is that you know

27
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,390
automation and DevOps would play right

28
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,479
into you know accreditation process that

29
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:31,860
they use so I'm Scott Bennett CTC for

30
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,189
quite a while the the principal cyber

31
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:39,659
security engineer I'm Frank sysadmin at

32
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:42,479
CTC worked a lot with Scott on our

33
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,310
external clients and Lucas on our

34
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,220
internal corporate network Lucas and I'm

35
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,909
a security engineer also at CDC so real

36
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:53,729
quick about two weeks ago

37
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:57,619
Lucas was promoted to a manager so yeah

38
00:01:57,619 --> 00:01:59,939
so yeah

39
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:03,630
Kirk hurt for months he busted my yeah

40
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,820
whatever yeah okay we'll move on I

41
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,409
called man yeah now he was giving me a

42
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:09,060
hard time he's called me a manager and

43
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,569
now yeah so so just this yeah yeah so

44
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:13,830
he's non-technical

45
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,140
like he's going away party I guess wait

46
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:22,230
them so show hands who in the room works

47
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:26,910
with the risk management framework so

48
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,110
quite a few

49
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,720
how about DevOps we're trying to

50
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,420
integrate DevOps or automation into

51
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,820
there so the risk management framework

52
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,640
something that's been around within the

53
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,780
United States government for not that

54
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,760
long it was it was where there moved

55
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,910
from going from a prescriptive security

56
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,190
approach a check block mentality if you

57
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:50,610
will

58
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:55,830
security approach to a more of applying

59
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:58,560
the appropriate levels of controls I

60
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,780
talked a bit about that I probably don't

61
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,050
want to jump ahead too far but you know

62
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,470
so the the big idea behind our talk is

63
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,560
is how the DevOps and the continuous

64
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,750
deployment pipeline have set up right

65
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,209
done right with the automation how that

66
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:17,970
really supports the RMF process or the

67
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,400
for the compliance right or the system

68
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:29,610
security plans you for now yep I'm good

69
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,600
next slide so okay we did that already

70
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,970
and this idea of a couple memes in here

71
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,410
because you never want to show up meme

72
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,959
'less for the presentation so not as

73
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:40,950
many as I'd like because that's really

74
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,330
the important part of the talk right is

75
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:44,010
getting the memes right so it takes so

76
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:47,519
long that you know often yeah spend a

77
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,709
lot of time there it's worth it so we're

78
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:51,570
gonna talk quickly about so DevOps give

79
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:54,000
it some background what DevOps is I mean

80
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,010
what we think DevOps is it's kind of one

81
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:57,600
of those buzzword bingo things everyone

82
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,450
likes to talk about and also the

83
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,950
background there and why we think some

84
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,450
of the pre RMF stuff was really terrible

85
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:04,709
and set us up for some bad habits

86
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:06,570
especially on the government side and

87
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,880
then how we can bring those two things

88
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,420
together

89
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,610
RMF and DevOps to experience some

90
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:15,090
efficiencies or synergies as we managers

91
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:19,220
like to talk about synergy a paradigm so

92
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,590
one of the things I want to talk caution

93
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,210
about I guess is you hear people talk

94
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,470
they're talking about things they do

95
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,419
this it'll save the world and it's

96
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:27,700
really

97
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,110
even automation is really hard at

98
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,130
something that is implementing

99
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,200
implementing it at an organizational

100
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,030
level especially because it difficult

101
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,800
because it's a mindset change and how we

102
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,030
address things how we do things I

103
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:37,960
wouldn't think you're trying to take

104
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,820
their job away by scripting out those

105
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,320
things they do so it's it's something

106
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,630
that takes time and it's a it's gonna be

107
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,760
difficult so although I think there's a

108
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,590
lot of value in it it's certainly

109
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,240
something you have to consider and at

110
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,140
the cost of before jumping into so

111
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:56,080
DevOps client development principles to

112
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,700
infrastructure and trying to do those

113
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,190
releases and things rapidly getting

114
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,090
things out there quickly

115
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:04,480
so prior to DevOps I think that this is

116
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,780
where my next right here is what we did

117
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,550
before that which was not as not as fun

118
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,440
or as good but then you have map which

119
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,300
is a risk management framework which the

120
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,370
DoD introduced is it trying to as a way

121
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:19,270
to try to introduce the value of what

122
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,760
you're securing or the impact of if it

123
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,260
goes down into the process of securing

124
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,250
it so a lot of times you you have

125
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,660
$10,000 in security for 50 cents worth

126
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,850
of asset because process doesn't support

127
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:34,330
anything less so we don't want to do

128
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:39,190
that no so prior to the RMF process

129
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,780
through Spanish for a framework the

130
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,400
government for many years and you

131
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,470
probably see this in other regulated

132
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,450
environments or compliance environments

133
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:49,020
where they it's more of a prescriptive

134
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,750
approach to security right where the the

135
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,550
security controls don't really take into

136
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:57,100
account the risk levels or the

137
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,590
categorization of the data where you

138
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,840
know that for many many years the

139
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,430
government did this painful painful

140
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:07,090
thing called die cap and like Luke's who

141
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,040
comes up with the acronym but the idea

142
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,990
was is that it wasn't it can there was

143
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:14,790
no continuous monitoring of the

144
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:17,260
security posture of the application or

145
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,690
the system you would do at a point in

146
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:21,100
time you would build this really thick

147
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,290
system security plan and if you guys are

148
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:25,300
do that often right a lot of the

149
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,000
paperwork throw it over the fence and a

150
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,520
couple years later you come back and try

151
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,140
to look at it and figure out what it's

152
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:35,050
changed right so what we're what we're

153
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,250
excited about what the risk mantel I

154
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,210
don't know if that's kind of the right

155
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,920
thing we're happy to see what the risk

156
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,450
management framework they're applying

157
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:41,590
the right levels

158
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:44,140
purity for the data right not applying a

159
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,060
million dollars worth of data our

160
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:49,060
security to ten dollars worth of data so

161
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,330
importantly right and then so in in the

162
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,740
developed world you have the pre DevOps

163
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,260
environments in which we hate we

164
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,460
developers will go away we get we go

165
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,740
have some some probably not even

166
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,570
technical people go talk to clients cuz

167
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:03,490
we don't like talking to clients there's

168
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,540
some requirements bring some of those

169
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,130
back to me we're all gonna squirrel away

170
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,110
in a basement somewhere with a bunch of

171
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,700
energy drinks and stuff we're gonna give

172
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,320
you something in like five years

173
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,630
sometimes ten sometimes never get

174
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,820
anything right there was this idea of

175
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,370
throwing products over the fence and of

176
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:21,910
course it doesn't end up well in the

177
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:22,930
history of software I think we've seen

178
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:23,830
over and over again that that just

179
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:24,730
doesn't work it doesn't know how to

180
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:26,530
schedule doesn't allow us to give

181
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:29,260
customers clients whatever what they

182
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,420
need at the end because they're so long

183
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:35,130
and the speed the speed of change is now

184
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:36,730
drastically different than it was when

185
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,380
we were even considering those types of

186
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,150
technologies so who here has seen the

187
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:43,090
other guys the movie yeah so if you know

188
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,140
what this yeah

189
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:50,380
the PLC reference yeah as I said

190
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,020
attempts to address that old diet cap

191
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,580
mentality of hey we're gonna throw it

192
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,570
over the fence in three years and you

193
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:57,100
guys get to deal with it I was I worked

194
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,800
on engaging one time when we were we

195
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,300
were trying to help assess some achieve

196
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,400
accreditation and the system was in a

197
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,590
nuclear fallout shelter and it didn't

198
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:07,360
have if so was it was also air gapped

199
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,710
right but the weeks stepped into this we

200
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,240
should walk in with okay let's let's see

201
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,130
what the update pot for the system is so

202
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:17,730
the system itself hadn't been touched in

203
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:21,670
almost three years exactly so since the

204
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,200
last since three years before that was

205
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,150
last time they apply patches updated

206
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:27,210
antivirus signatures I mean anything

207
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:29,590
besides something to keep it running and

208
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,060
touched anything security wise because

209
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,950
it was difficult they didn't care

210
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,210
because no one was checking them on it

211
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:37,270
and they didn't have to care I guess you

212
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,440
know I mean one of those things about

213
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,720
about standards and compliance which I

214
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,400
mean that don't we all love compliance

215
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,080
isn't it awesome like compliance is

216
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,340
wonderful right you want to get up in

217
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,810
the morning go to compliancy things

218
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:49,630
really I mean it's it's terrible I mean

219
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,730
we hate someone say you're insecure

220
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,800
because you didn't meet this requirement

221
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,940
in this standard

222
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,190
which may or may not be a security thing

223
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,870
but because of problems like this

224
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,490
because it's no one's checking what

225
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:01,900
people are doing and implanting security

226
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,730
wise compliance has become something

227
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,200
that we're gonna have to deal with as

228
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,300
long as long as they're a threat and as

229
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,270
long as they're developers like like we

230
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,410
should be who only do what we're

231
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,030
supposed to do or are told to do right

232
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:16,120
then compliance in holding our feet to

233
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,380
the fire with some type of standard an

234
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,910
assessment is gonna be important so risk

235
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,470
management framework attempts to kind of

236
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,520
take that away by saying okay you know

237
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:21,850
what

238
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,290
we're gonna try to stop this thing that

239
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:24,490
first of all we're gonna evaluate you

240
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,260
based on risk so what's the impact level

241
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,930
of your of your system and if you're

242
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,370
have an armament background you're

243
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,060
familiar with that you could have

244
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:31,960
triggered it into your head

245
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,280
and like the fifth one nine nine what's

246
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,810
your impact stuff and even those

247
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,040
categories were really brought it's hard

248
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,120
to figure out what the heck is the risk

249
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,520
like low Mott high I mean there's

250
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,200
there's a lot of latitude in between

251
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,760
those low moderate high system things

252
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,560
that you mean it's hard it's hard to

253
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,890
quantify but the drastic shift was we're

254
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:50,410
gonna stop the once and done thing we're

255
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:51,970
gonna say okay we're gonna have periodic

256
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:54,010
reassessments and but but also you're

257
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,290
required to build in this monitoring of

258
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:59,050
your security as part of the cycle or

259
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,490
part of the software cycle or the

260
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:01,840
accreditations like whatever whatever

261
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,070
part of that whether it's at the system

262
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,570
or application level that has to be

263
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:07,710
built in and then additionally you can't

264
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,520
when you get to when you get to

265
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,690
optimization you have to have a strategy

266
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:11,980
for how are you going to do that there

267
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:12,880
has to be some way you have to

268
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,140
demonstrate how are you going to go take

269
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:17,140
that security state now and maintain it

270
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,630
going forward yeah I wanna say too so

271
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,490
that we kind of the segue and from the

272
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,110
dike app from the prescriptive not

273
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:25,270
really looking at the system or level

274
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:29,170
setting what the system does an RMF even

275
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,000
though that you're not maybe have to

276
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,430
follow that compliance or a follow RMF

277
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,980
what were you know our hypothesis is is

278
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,590
that the RMF is a solid thing right it's

279
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,180
especially if you're looking to go move

280
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,370
to DevOps that following this process

281
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:45,550
the six step process of whether we're

282
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,980
gonna go over today is is a positive

283
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:52,900
thing this is really right give me stuff

284
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,730
faster you guys seen that Dilbert where

285
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,890
like the the boss guys comes in and he's

286
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,000
like I saw this thing that I was

287
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,620
witnessing on agile and it says that you

288
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,900
can that it can I can do like so much

289
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,990
code with like one programmer and we can

290
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,100
get rid of all of you guys know any one

291
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:06,760
programmer

292
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,260
isn't that what people here with your

293
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:08,649
DevOps

294
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:10,660
I can you mean I can deploy in like 30

295
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,069
seconds later he's like type of line of

296
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:12,790
code and it's push to production

297
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:16,059
automatically but so but as an aside to

298
00:11:16,059 --> 00:11:17,379
that often what gets left out of

299
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:19,420
discussion is the security of the

300
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:22,480
deployment pipeline and so I think be

301
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,559
honest working on the security side I

302
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:25,809
think when DevOps developers hear this

303
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:28,569
in terms of developing code in DevOps

304
00:11:28,569 --> 00:11:30,360
environment they think I can build

305
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,480
insecure stuff faster right I got I can

306
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,069
get a bracket really fast now like I

307
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:37,629
mean sure we can fix things fast but

308
00:11:37,629 --> 00:11:39,249
often because by considering security in

309
00:11:39,249 --> 00:11:40,660
the first place we're just getting at

310
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,179
the production insecurely faster so a

311
00:11:43,179 --> 00:11:50,170
lot headshake when you said that so once

312
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,730
again to the manager speak right

313
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,829
everybody you know there are plenty of

314
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:55,209
synergies here we're giving them out

315
00:11:55,209 --> 00:11:57,550
today there's a lot of synergies between

316
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,420
the RMF and the DevOps cycle are the

317
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,790
continuous delivery pipeline and this

318
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:08,800
graphic here you can see the the white

319
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,740
right the white text is the DevOps

320
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:15,699
right the DevOps pipeline the black text

321
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:20,050
is the RMF process where the process is

322
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,600
a sixth process starting with

323
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,160
categorization and the selection

324
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,019
categorization of data and the selection

325
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:28,800
rules the implementation of controls

326
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,069
assessment authorization and monitoring

327
00:12:33,069 --> 00:12:35,050
where yeah I'll let you read the other

328
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,689
ones but so this I think maybe I don't

329
00:12:37,689 --> 00:12:39,399
know if this one or the RMF mean is

330
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:42,759
probably but I mean I don't like

331
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:45,069
synergies go back to work and we talked

332
00:12:45,069 --> 00:12:46,389
about the synergies we're going to

333
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:50,230
provide by really what we're seeing

334
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:52,059
we're trying to map or portrays how you

335
00:12:52,059 --> 00:12:54,189
at which phases of the process and you

336
00:12:54,189 --> 00:12:55,870
can map this in a nation and this is

337
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,069
we've tried we tried to kind of talk

338
00:12:57,069 --> 00:12:58,959
about okay if you're a dev up shop and

339
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,339
you were looking for a security standard

340
00:13:00,339 --> 00:13:01,959
you're like okay we want to build

341
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:03,939
security in our development process what

342
00:13:03,939 --> 00:13:05,529
would that look like if we wanted to use

343
00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:07,540
RMF for that but it's kind of hard to

344
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,730
try to dual-purpose it so I think there

345
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,199
is some value there and I think you can

346
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:12,790
if you're looking for a standard of

347
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,799
compliance that is kind of ubiquitous

348
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:17,939
ubiquitous across many different

349
00:13:17,939 --> 00:13:20,079
regulation standards or compliance

350
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,160
interview that you would want to use

351
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,580
that would be a good one but I think

352
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,820
the priority that we are hoping to bring

353
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,620
forward is that for a government of our

354
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,290
environment or for someone implementing

355
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:31,790
according to that standard that the

356
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,470
DevOps provides you a lot of latitude

357
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:36,760
were in the management of efficiencies

358
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,840
you know just real quick the thought

359
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,820
unity - about the dike at maybe what we

360
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,930
did would talk about - is that the

361
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:46,400
entire process if you have ever been

362
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,040
involved in it is such a painful thing

363
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,630
where literally you could add 50 to 75

364
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,820
percent to the bottom line of what the

365
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,650
code and the infrastructure should cost

366
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:00,980
to get it an ATO undertook cap right and

367
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:06,140
the idea with RMF should be cheaper so

368
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,050
the first phase of an RMF environment is

369
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:10,760
categorization and that's that that idea

370
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,790
of hey just how important is this system

371
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:16,370
application to my organization so I mean

372
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:18,620
and one of the problems here that he's

373
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,820
gonna jump out at least he jumped out to

374
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,680
me right away is when you start talking

375
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,270
to you about okay we need to secure our

376
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,860
critical information where the heck is

377
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,090
the critical information does anyone

378
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,620
know does it I mean you start asking

379
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,090
around okay where where is the

380
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:30,500
proprietary data if you're in private

381
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,690
where is the financial data the health

382
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:35,420
data whereas the classified data like if

383
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,460
there's they say that like a sensitive

384
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,720
made a hole and you can put it all in

385
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,100
there like so you can just pull it out

386
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,660
and secure it in at one spot but it's

387
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,220
not like that right it's all it's all

388
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,870
your network it's usually not segmented

389
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:47,420
correctly in terms of protection but

390
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,370
that's that's one of the hard parts of

391
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:51,410
this initial process is pretty on where

392
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:53,240
the heck of stuff is so you can even try

393
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,340
or attempt to secure it now if you're

394
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,200
looking out for an application level the

395
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,190
first thing you want to figure out is

396
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:01,460
okay what's if you're trying to if

397
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,980
you're coming at this blind or blank

398
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,480
slate wise from automation like and

399
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,350
you're saying okay you know we don't

400
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,880
have any automation like to get there

401
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,110
you're gonna want to start trying to

402
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,360
figure out what the heck your automation

403
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,500
is going to look like in this space

404
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,570
isn't it I mean for from the RMF

405
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,340
perspective from that process you're

406
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,590
just saying hey is this worth what's the

407
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,180
impact let's move on from that and start

408
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,380
looking at what controls we want to

409
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,910
apply to it but if you're actually

410
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,320
trying to automate stuff and you want to

411
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,420
say okay how can I start building

412
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,010
there's automation baselines or how can

413
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,480
I figure out where automation applies

414
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,520
and how it best applies early on in the

415
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,300
process so you know over the past I

416
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,499
don't know how many years so we do it

417
00:15:36,499 --> 00:15:38,779
lot of assessments of third parties

418
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:41,299
government agencies small to

419
00:15:41,299 --> 00:15:43,189
medium-sized businesses and one of the

420
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:44,569
first questions are you go in and you

421
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:46,309
ask you know how's your network setup

422
00:15:46,309 --> 00:15:48,139
have you categorized your data do you

423
00:15:48,139 --> 00:15:50,209
know where your data is at and I can't

424
00:15:50,209 --> 00:15:53,719
say 100% that I would say well over 95%

425
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:55,669
of the organization's really can't

426
00:15:55,669 --> 00:15:58,729
answer this and hopefully you know by

427
00:15:58,729 --> 00:16:00,649
implementing this process this

428
00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:04,549
categorization phase will be something

429
00:16:04,549 --> 00:16:06,679
that would be a no-brainer and obviously

430
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:08,209
you know if you didn't have users this

431
00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:11,479
would be probably easier as well and of

432
00:16:11,479 --> 00:16:12,499
course the key takeaway because I know

433
00:16:12,499 --> 00:16:14,209
like you're listening listening to

434
00:16:14,209 --> 00:16:15,439
external and talking here it's hard to

435
00:16:15,439 --> 00:16:16,249
get anything out of it but the key

436
00:16:16,249 --> 00:16:18,649
takeaway sorry identify key takeaway

437
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:19,759
from each step but the key takeaway is

438
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,499
here when you're building something new

439
00:16:21,499 --> 00:16:23,479
or trying to get something accredited or

440
00:16:23,479 --> 00:16:24,739
just out to production because it's in

441
00:16:24,739 --> 00:16:25,789
the private sector that's kind of what

442
00:16:25,789 --> 00:16:27,409
it is right think about what's the

443
00:16:27,409 --> 00:16:30,469
impact of the data and then what how

444
00:16:30,469 --> 00:16:32,239
does that relate to how one is secure

445
00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:33,829
because I mean that's the real question

446
00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:36,019
we want to ask ourselves in in all the

447
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:37,369
other fluff aside that's that's really

448
00:16:37,369 --> 00:16:39,049
what the key is okay how what's it gonna

449
00:16:39,049 --> 00:16:41,119
do if it goes down even if it's from a

450
00:16:41,119 --> 00:16:43,309
non the developer accidentally shuts off

451
00:16:43,309 --> 00:16:45,439
the web service I mean it's still down

452
00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:51,319
right so how does it impact and so part

453
00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:53,239
of that is part of that design phase

454
00:16:53,239 --> 00:16:55,069
that you can really set yourself up for

455
00:16:55,069 --> 00:16:58,249
success on the later phases of this

456
00:16:58,249 --> 00:16:59,329
where you're going to do some heavy

457
00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:01,789
automation is figuring out what are the

458
00:17:01,789 --> 00:17:03,499
change key so in the gut well the

459
00:17:03,499 --> 00:17:04,309
government's out you out you have

460
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:05,990
approvals it's like a approval Palooza

461
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,579
right everybody has to prove this this

462
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:09,138
has to be approved and signed off one so

463
00:17:09,138 --> 00:17:11,329
identify those areas or things and your

464
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:12,709
process is where someone has to approve

465
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:14,480
it so you can build automation to meet

466
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,069
those goals like if there needs to be an

467
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,750
approval process and this is something

468
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,819
that Frank Frank and I worked on not too

469
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:21,888
long ago where we had so the idea that

470
00:17:21,888 --> 00:17:23,269
we we want to make sure that we can

471
00:17:23,269 --> 00:17:25,220
still the for code goes into another

472
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,470
environment how do you give someone

473
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:28,970
making a decision you may not have

474
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,799
intamin develop and knowledge of what's

475
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:31,759
going on how do you give them the

476
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,320
information they need do they need to

477
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,409
have to make a yes or no decision or

478
00:17:36,409 --> 00:17:38,659
whether that gets propagated or pushed

479
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:41,539
to the next phase or into production so

480
00:17:41,539 --> 00:17:42,740
the goal so thinking about these ideas

481
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,840
okay what am i what are the critical

482
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,869
areas of this what needs to be decided

483
00:17:47,869 --> 00:17:48,889
on what how do I give them that

484
00:17:48,889 --> 00:17:49,940
information

485
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:53,450
anyway and then we had we had a recent

486
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:55,309
experience where we were working an RMF

487
00:17:55,309 --> 00:17:56,870
environment for the government this goes

488
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,220
back to the risk by governments always

489
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,720
efficient right we needed to get a

490
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,120
laptop accredited at a secret level so

491
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,240
we went through the process I mean the

492
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,100
hardening things are not that difficult

493
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,330
so that that's some of the things we

494
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:11,600
volunteered to do it but the price the

495
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,950
cost of the Accrediting a single laptop

496
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:15,620
there's about $800 of like an i5 six

497
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:19,509
gigs of RAM just standard standard stuff

498
00:18:19,509 --> 00:18:22,629
seventy-five thousand dollars of labor

499
00:18:22,629 --> 00:18:26,029
that's true IQ story yeah we weren't

500
00:18:26,029 --> 00:18:29,419
gonna believe this but $75,000 to $700

501
00:18:29,419 --> 00:18:32,210
or date or maybe dollars because the

502
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:33,409
government bought it so maybe it was a

503
00:18:33,409 --> 00:18:36,980
thousand I don't know and you wonder why

504
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,389
there's the two thousand dollar a hammer

505
00:18:38,389 --> 00:18:41,990
but them yeah so not only would it be 75

506
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:45,289
K would have Brendan six months - yeah -

507
00:18:45,289 --> 00:18:52,250
get a laptop of proof so selection is

508
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,460
okay I know what my impact of this data

509
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,009
is okay so then what does that mean in

510
00:18:58,009 --> 00:18:59,450
terms of the security going to implement

511
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:01,399
and a lot of times in government sectors

512
00:19:01,399 --> 00:19:02,570
that's that's the already decided for

513
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,460
you in other words I have a choice so if

514
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,860
you're at impact system controls we're

515
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,000
going to apply and you have to either

516
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,190
show how you've done them or for how

517
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,649
you've implemented them or tell us why

518
00:19:12,649 --> 00:19:15,049
you didn't do that right but but in both

519
00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:16,429
government and private sector there's a

520
00:19:16,429 --> 00:19:18,529
lot of specialization after that so say

521
00:19:18,529 --> 00:19:20,629
you I want to put a Windows host on the

522
00:19:20,629 --> 00:19:22,399
network I mean that's sometimes the

523
00:19:22,399 --> 00:19:23,570
requirements will get had any windows

524
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:25,970
box on the network okay there's a lot of

525
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:27,830
things beyond that they really did

526
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:31,159
really have a impact on what the

527
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:32,539
security profile that device looks like

528
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:33,769
I mean is it something that's supporting

529
00:19:33,769 --> 00:19:36,320
like is it a DC is it a web server is it

530
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,399
something that's supporting automation

531
00:19:37,399 --> 00:19:38,600
is I mean there are a lot of things that

532
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,789
can kind of really drastically affect

533
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:42,620
what that thing should be allowed to do

534
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,480
how you would harden it you know and

535
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,789
things like that so a quick way to

536
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:48,320
shortcut some of that especially and

537
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,700
once again drive your automation is

538
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,830
deciding early on okay what are what are

539
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,240
the what are the types of things we have

540
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,919
and then you can start the lowest level

541
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:58,250
very easy Linux Windows that's to

542
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:01,009
baselines right Linux windows

543
00:20:01,009 --> 00:20:02,610
it's a Mac soon

544
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:05,760
hmm no there's put it max max you've

545
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,230
helped us some business right there's no

546
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,640
why do we have them so we can keep her

547
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,340
out this people anyway sorry now the

548
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,740
windows and so you have to baseline two

549
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,390
or three if you are having that shot you

550
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,919
get three baseline that's that's the

551
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:18,419
place you can start with that may be on

552
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:19,590
that is the thing about business

553
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:22,529
questions that affect the security of or

554
00:20:22,529 --> 00:20:24,510
the functionality which is what the your

555
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,950
users and your developers care about the

556
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:29,100
functionality of that host right and

557
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,019
this in this situation the data impact

558
00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:32,940
the second question there yeah is it

559
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,860
goes from you know if there's a breach

560
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,139
or disclosure of information that it

561
00:20:37,139 --> 00:20:38,669
would significantly impact the

562
00:20:38,669 --> 00:20:41,940
organization or agency where moderate

563
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,340
may have some significant impact loss of

564
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,470
money where and then you know depending

565
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,539
on the industry that you're in you know

566
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:51,419
high would be something along the lines

567
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:53,309
of you know loss of data could be loss

568
00:20:53,309 --> 00:20:55,529
of life right so but you could come up

569
00:20:55,529 --> 00:20:57,240
if you don't use this this these are

570
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,120
NIST standard right if you follow the

571
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,980
NIST stuff these are the the NIST

572
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:08,340
standards so the key here once again to

573
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:11,549
take away it I mean setting having an

574
00:21:11,549 --> 00:21:13,080
idea for yourself as an organization

575
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,460
whether it's the are meant for whether

576
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,919
it's like Asian or 171 which is a really

577
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:18,539
a boil down version of that of those

578
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:21,600
massive 853 standards like figuring out

579
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,159
what you want to do as an organization

580
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:26,100
to define what books good security

581
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,980
perspective okay I have a DMZ e-commerce

582
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,600
application you might say you know what

583
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,460
I'm losing money every second that thing

584
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,409
has a problem therefore that's a high

585
00:21:34,409 --> 00:21:36,450
system to me right military or DoD why

586
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:38,700
they don't care about that but but once

587
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,649
again it really comes down to defining

588
00:21:40,649 --> 00:21:43,230
an organizational level okay how are we

589
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:45,029
going to secure things and then how do

590
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:46,799
we want to standardize that across the

591
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,899
board now you can do that and build all

592
00:21:48,899 --> 00:21:50,580
that yourself but there's a lot of

593
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,659
frameworks out there you could probably

594
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:54,389
just pull one in pick and choose a

595
00:21:54,389 --> 00:21:55,679
little bit and start from something like

596
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:55,919
that

597
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,559
I think the key takeaway once again just

598
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,330
defining something at an organizational

599
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:01,769
level that says okay this is how we're

600
00:22:01,769 --> 00:22:04,139
gonna define security lemont high like

601
00:22:04,139 --> 00:22:06,299
whether it's by payment processing where

602
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:09,720
where data is or the classification of

603
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,559
what processes

604
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:16,930
okay now one of the cool things as we

605
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:18,210
were working this is it

606
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:21,010
well not that's cool thing but as a geek

607
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:22,180
it's cool it seemed like a cool thing so

608
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:25,930
ssp system security plan is yeah aren't

609
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:28,270
they a blast - right right isn't a great

610
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:30,100
disco there just update Word documents

611
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,580
like and Scott was telling a story about

612
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:35,200
the consultants yeah yeah actually we

613
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,030
get paid by the pound right

614
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:39,100
the pay is the more paperwork there was

615
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,870
they would yeah that's a name it they

616
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:43,030
would do that and the true story is that

617
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,800
they would think that if they would kill

618
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,809
when the system security plan with you

619
00:22:46,809 --> 00:22:47,650
know just like when you were in high

620
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:48,010
school

621
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:50,350
those that thing nobody would even read

622
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:52,150
it alright so it had to be secure when

623
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:54,670
it's that thing yeah okay pay by the

624
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:56,290
pound it's a thousand pages I mean it's

625
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:59,650
gotta be good okay so the key here so

626
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:02,679
I'm gonna read my slide sorry back to

627
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:05,260
the SSP part so treating compliance and

628
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,030
security activities as another part of

629
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,559
the development process so instead of

630
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:09,970
having okay security guys over here

631
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:11,890
there's some security stuff then you got

632
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:12,940
your dev guys over here working on

633
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:15,130
important stuff right and then how we're

634
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,120
seeing sometimes especially in the

635
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,410
private sector what are you gonna turn

636
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:18,970
off my money-making machine or slow it

637
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:20,800
down so that I can put security in

638
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,570
anyway putting it all on the same bucket

639
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:25,059
okay and then establishing based on your

640
00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:27,190
common controls of okay we need to

641
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,360
implement this we need to do this when

642
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,820
you do that establishing user stories or

643
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,070
backlog items or tasks however you track

644
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,900
them internally establishing that in the

645
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,190
same bucket as a development effort so

646
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,780
you say okay I'm working in developing

647
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,880
on this product here my security tasks

648
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,830
here's my development tasks they're in

649
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,390
the same bucket they have to be they

650
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:44,860
have to prioritize along with all the

651
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,809
other work so you can kind of see where

652
00:23:46,809 --> 00:23:47,890
things are now here's the cool thing

653
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:49,270
about or why I think it's cool about it

654
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:51,309
is that okay if you if you make your

655
00:23:51,309 --> 00:23:53,350
security controls tasks or stories then

656
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,300
as you implement those things and

657
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,700
checking things against those tasks and

658
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,620
stories you have a couple things first

659
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,179
of all to an auditor which we all have

660
00:24:01,179 --> 00:24:02,770
auditors and just into compliance right

661
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:05,830
to an honor you have a trail from what

662
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,660
you've done compliance wise or you've

663
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,760
saved them directly back to code and

664
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,550
work changes they've been checked in or

665
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:15,610
done in support of that task and going

666
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:16,330
back to the SSP

667
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,970
what you have now if you go through so

668
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:20,860
that you log back in your your task

669
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,960
tracking tool you say hey where's what's

670
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,340
my security status pull out for security

671
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,750
related items

672
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,430
what's the what is the completion status

673
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:28,750
on all of us you can get a very quick

674
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,880
assessment of where you're at it's part

675
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,200
of the product development lifecycle or

676
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,090
even later on after it's been fielded

677
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:35,860
where you're at compliance wise you can

678
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:36,880
see what's been checked in what's

679
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,020
remaining to be done because of sub

680
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,690
stories and tasks and then finally

681
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:43,600
exporting that out is a thing called an

682
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,020
SSP because you have what you've done

683
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,040
you said you're going to do what you've

684
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:48,400
done

685
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,380
check thing and then that export that

686
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,670
the developer hopefully because all of

687
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:53,200
us developers like really great check-in

688
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:59,770
comments right yeah so if you have good

689
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:01,570
comments there then you have what you've

690
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:03,670
done technically also in the same thing

691
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:05,530
which exporting that creates an SSP

692
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:07,690
because you outlined those tasks as part

693
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:13,930
of the security controls and don't know

694
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:15,340
so the tailor went back to the

695
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,110
questionnaire I'm sorry I kind of threw

696
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:19,510
that but some some way of saying okay

697
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,860
what do we do that's a little different

698
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,000
because all everyone does something a

699
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,500
little bit different industry white wise

700
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,410
or I mean maybe organization wise maybe

701
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:27,970
you yourself do something a little bit

702
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:29,320
different but you want to be able to try

703
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,690
to figure out that and then make it a

704
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:33,300
process you can actually automate

705
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:39,490
automation it's key implementation this

706
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:40,290
is the hard part

707
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:44,560
so you've got a common set of controls

708
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,180
right you've been working hard you've

709
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,890
talked to your managers they forced all

710
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:49,690
those developers to do these things for

711
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:51,610
security or to agree to do these things

712
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:53,440
for security you've got an idea of the

713
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,240
impact of all of this to your system and

714
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,190
now you're ready to say ok let's start

715
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:59,530
let's start writing stuff so this is

716
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:01,300
really the hard part it really is

717
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,470
because you're going to say especially

718
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:03,400
if you're not if you don't have an

719
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,410
automation background or support then

720
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:06,430
it's gonna be difficult because you're

721
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:09,250
starting from Ground Zero square one

722
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:11,680
pick your metaphor there but you're

723
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,000
you're really good you have to figure

724
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,800
out okay how are we gonna automatically

725
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,860
I kind of all these things work so

726
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,090
you're gonna heavily rely on your

727
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:21,100
development staff and your IT support

728
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,510
staff we love security they love glue

729
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:23,830
and security tasking and it was much

730
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,480
further put down their projects and come

731
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,660
out but anyway it's a big change really

732
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:31,210
it's really gonna be finding a tool

733
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:32,950
finding picking what's right for your

734
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:35,110
organization in terms of automation and

735
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:39,000
then getting to work

736
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,500
so one of the critical things here that

737
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,779
we've discussed several times about this

738
00:26:43,779 --> 00:26:50,049
this also helps with keeping scope yeah

739
00:26:50,049 --> 00:26:52,149
image scope right that you're able to

740
00:26:52,149 --> 00:26:54,130
control the things to go out and

741
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:55,630
hopefully hide the security from the

742
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:57,010
developers before he gets to the

743
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:59,080
developer right things are built in so

744
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:03,250
your your dev your dev M eyes or

745
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,529
whatever are the same as what your your

746
00:27:05,529 --> 00:27:08,890
flowing into operations and then just

747
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:10,600
picking picking those items of security

748
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:14,080
hopefully hopefully by priority of so

749
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,399
what you've identified as problems or

750
00:27:15,399 --> 00:27:16,389
security controls you're going to meet

751
00:27:16,389 --> 00:27:17,950
picking those off of that backlog or

752
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:20,860
story list see the GRA issue whatever it

753
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:23,049
is and then moving forward with them in

754
00:27:23,049 --> 00:27:24,970
trying to prioritize that by criticality

755
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:26,889
is important especially I'm trying to

756
00:27:26,889 --> 00:27:28,659
keep up with the speed what we're trying

757
00:27:28,659 --> 00:27:30,610
what we're hoping you're going for in

758
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:33,549
the development operation so once again

759
00:27:33,549 --> 00:27:35,440
the question a good question asked here

760
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,570
is so what's the goal of the control or

761
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:39,190
what's the goal because that's a lot of

762
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,450
times what gets lost and in the

763
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,700
compliance versus real security right

764
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,440
they want they want to do what it says

765
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,659
on the paper without understanding what

766
00:27:46,659 --> 00:27:48,669
the reason in behind or sometimes the

767
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:50,620
paper is just a stupid idea I mean I

768
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,510
mean it's not like there were Martians

769
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:54,039
that came in dropped off these perfect

770
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,929
compliance standards right people

771
00:27:55,929 --> 00:27:57,429
develop these and sometimes they're not

772
00:27:57,429 --> 00:27:58,510
they're not very well written they're

773
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,889
done they don't really reflect real

774
00:27:59,889 --> 00:28:01,809
world security very well so like the key

775
00:28:01,809 --> 00:28:03,370
though especially in the private side if

776
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:05,740
you're not defined by compliance as we

777
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:06,970
all are in the government you want to

778
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:08,080
make sure that you're developing

779
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,840
controls with the goal in mind so I mean

780
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,600
automating notifications like what

781
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,429
questions about what is the right way

782
00:28:15,429 --> 00:28:18,639
this should look for example website up

783
00:28:18,639 --> 00:28:21,850
right can I ping it good we had how many

784
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:23,200
times we had sites go down no one knows

785
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,059
it went down it wasn't it wasn't even

786
00:28:25,059 --> 00:28:27,220
malfeasance or anyone it wasn't the

787
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:35,620
Russians and then people from West

788
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:39,100
Virginia yeah yeah I joked I said I

789
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,200
think I'm here but come West Virginia so

790
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,789
I had to me farewell Westerners shirt I

791
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:44,139
couldn't I really try to think of pit

792
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:48,130
jokes but I wasn't sure yeah oh yeah he

793
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:50,799
couldn't think of any pit jokes but if

794
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,700
you want Earl mountaineer joke

795
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,730
I have my teeth left I'm at the end yeah

796
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:58,440
ok so then once again just making sure

797
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,640
that you're thinking about the security

798
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,169
aspect from what the purpose of the

799
00:29:01,169 --> 00:29:02,850
thing is because the goal here is not to

800
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:06,360
get to compliance right the goal is to

801
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,760
maintain compliance maintain a secure

802
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,650
state throughout the lifecycle until you

803
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:11,940
turn that server off you want to know

804
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,500
what's going on and when it goes wrong

805
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,000
whether it's security problem or whether

806
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,400
it's a problem with like I said when

807
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,570
it's down it's down it doesn't matter

808
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:19,590
what caused it to be down it doesn't

809
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:20,970
matter what caused it to DDoS whether

810
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:22,950
it's your application it's got screwed

811
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:25,860
up request frequency or whether it's

812
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,270
someone actually ddossing it right so

813
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:29,070
it's that down is down so that I mean

814
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,960
the key out of the implementation phase

815
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,110
is making sure that you have a a desired

816
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:36,240
good state through whether it's puppet

817
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,149
baselines whether it's any of the other

818
00:29:39,149 --> 00:29:40,950
automation tools I said I keep saying

819
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:42,720
public because we use puppet so I try to

820
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,399
make it to agnostic but I'm sorry

821
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,130
thank you proof yes thanks the brain

822
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:53,700
size s Leben yeah yes so just a desired

823
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,429
good state so what what's good if you

824
00:29:56,429 --> 00:29:58,380
know what's good - from a technical

825
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,480
perspective at the end of this phase

826
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,270
you're on the right track

827
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:06,990
hey I'm shalini Asst yeah about other

828
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:08,370
automation tools to prove that I'm not

829
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:10,110
but I'm in agnostic what happened to

830
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:12,950
your mean game here to come out sorry

831
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:15,260
I'm sorry

832
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,640
so then the assessment part and this is

833
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,649
where the bang for the buck comes in

834
00:30:19,649 --> 00:30:20,820
because if you've done your if you die

835
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,230
all these other steps right if you built

836
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:23,429
the automation correctly to say ok

837
00:30:23,429 --> 00:30:24,779
what's the correct state tell me when

838
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:27,870
it's wrong I mean the assessment portion

839
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:30,809
is looking what you've got I mean it

840
00:30:30,809 --> 00:30:31,919
tells you when there's something wrong

841
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,049
now the evidence there is you may need

842
00:30:34,049 --> 00:30:35,700
there are some things you may need to go

843
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,529
look at it say okay I'm gonna check this

844
00:30:37,529 --> 00:30:38,880
because the auto wants to see config

845
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,950
file off of something but the state of

846
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:42,149
your application if you're going with

847
00:30:42,149 --> 00:30:43,409
baselines if you've tailored them

848
00:30:43,409 --> 00:30:44,520
correctly to the functions of the

849
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,110
server's if you're look if you've done

850
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:48,539
that with the goal of these in mind the

851
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:50,220
goal of security in mind and the goal of

852
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,419
the control saying okay what's the

853
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:53,190
object of this okay what's my good state

854
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:55,230
okay how do I meet that good state is

855
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:57,929
this the side up yes down I want to know

856
00:30:57,929 --> 00:31:00,539
if send me an email is am I getting fat

857
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:03,240
logins had to reached my regulation to

858
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,910
find threshold send me an email

859
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:08,190
and through this you can then how do you

860
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:10,710
said that work yeah get the Dynamis eyes

861
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:12,540
I ever saw the famous eyes

862
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:18,960
yeah my isms yeah okay so you know how

863
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,950
to make some pride you some really great

864
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:22,020
stuff in because we all like going out

865
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,690
and running the same manual web

866
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:26,160
application scan or whatever it is

867
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,660
against applications when they come

868
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,940
through the pipe on right no so

869
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:33,510
something that the goal would be to have

870
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,610
these things assess as much as possible

871
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:37,980
as part of the complete to call the

872
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:42,300
continuous integration pipeline so but

873
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,070
the goal is to have so as when code is

874
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:46,620
checked in have a scan run against it

875
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:49,350
and then produce the results of that

876
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,390
skin as part of the merge request or

877
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:53,010
ticket or whatever you're going to get

878
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:54,900
to the next level so that you have the

879
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,800
information you need to make the

880
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,200
decision you have the the trail

881
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,180
information linkage to the check-in and

882
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,710
then you also have the security data

883
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:03,600
that once again you wouldn't have had

884
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,040
because even when even when you run

885
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:10,800
manual scans what you have to do gonna

886
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,940
be stored somewhere where you can get to

887
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:14,310
often within your sent items then you

888
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:16,050
guys' your organization's archive

889
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:18,360
policies like one year long and then who

890
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,530
knew like two years later some of the

891
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:21,930
okay did you this thing broke I scanned

892
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:25,460
that for that sorry

893
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:30,690
so assessment is really based on how

894
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:32,670
well you've done in categorizing setting

895
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:35,220
up those controls and then implementing

896
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:38,540
them in an automated fashion

897
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,820
authorization this is where this is

898
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:44,250
where you realize all the work that you

899
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:46,080
put in or you realize all the work that

900
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,740
you have put in

901
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,240
especially on automation because what

902
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,390
happens when you're ready to go and you

903
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:54,150
have to prove compliance what we

904
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:56,550
immediately do oh crap I gotta go dig up

905
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:58,500
all this stuff I gotta figure out what

906
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,510
the heck we did to meet all these

907
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:01,530
security requirement that I knew you

908
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:03,060
were coming I just didn't have in the

909
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,920
design phase so now I gotta figure out

910
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,360
how the heck I'm gonna get from okay I

911
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,890
know I did this I'm pretty sure nice

912
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:10,590
it's configured it this way and then you

913
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:13,410
spend a long time I don't know how I

914
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:14,790
don't know how a long time sometimes

915
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:15,870
it's like six months smaller

916
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:17,340
applications maybe I mean spent all the

917
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,780
time getting ready or preparing these

918
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,710
authors

919
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:21,570
and packages and people make careers out

920
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:23,400
of authorization packages yeah I think

921
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:28,740
what white collar welfare the power of

922
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,780
saying no people people people just love

923
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,310
it when you come through with like some

924
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,300
of your documents their summary

925
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,940
documents not and I think there's a joy

926
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,070
in just wrecking people's world because

927
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:40,320
they get good they can't yes very fun

928
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,330
very fun stuff so what's acceptable to

929
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:44,790
be the point so once again not tailoring

930
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,500
this to an RMF government audience like

931
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,640
what is acceptable to you in your

932
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,110
organization for deployment

933
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:52,500
okay so then build that first and step

934
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,510
one and then just maintain it until you

935
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:57,450
ready to deploy because I mean how many

936
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:59,430
now you've done this like once again the

937
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:01,080
panic mode before you deploy it's like

938
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,160
oh crap we have all these things we

939
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,720
haven't done because we have we have in

940
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,100
fact they're not on the development list

941
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,570
they're not on your burn down chart not

942
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:07,980
any of that because I mean we don't

943
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,600
really care about security because it's

944
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,070
a negative thing I understand that it

945
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,540
doesn't provide that it just gives you

946
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,400
the ability to market things but so

947
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,230
build those things in the beginning and

948
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:18,750
then part becomes instead of this

949
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:21,750
massive overhead and scary now so so

950
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:23,940
just a few months ago we were working

951
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:24,449
with a client

952
00:34:24,449 --> 00:34:26,820
a large client who went through the

953
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:29,219
process of building out their continuous

954
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:30,900
develop the pipeline or deployment

955
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,620
pipeline through AWS so they built their

956
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:36,030
be somewhat terraform or whatever to use

957
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,650
they were building out their Mis and

958
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:39,570
their and that they were working with

959
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:42,030
the ops folks so that the Devon ops were

960
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:44,040
together and they put months of work

961
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,620
into it put a beautiful Identity and

962
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,600
Access Management System and it went to

963
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,360
deploy with the security folks and the

964
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,909
security folks said you know you have

965
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:55,920
all of this wrong so they actually spent

966
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,080
I don't know hundreds of thousands of

967
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:02,010
dollars and because the security was not

968
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:03,840
involved in the authorization right so

969
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,730
yeah I mean more recent example of

970
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:07,200
another project who worked on the once

971
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,260
again true stories sadly but three years

972
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,850
of development and there was no

973
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:14,460
authentication knowing they're gonna be

974
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,470
on a network they put it on a cloud

975
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:18,150
through here three years of development

976
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,890
and not authentication because they

977
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:21,870
hadn't needed it up to that point I mean

978
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:25,110
this is like this is 2018 I don't know I

979
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:26,460
mean sometimes sometimes you have to

980
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,050
wonder right but that's something

981
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:29,910
without thinking about the idea of what

982
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:31,930
what it's going to be used for

983
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:33,640
it's not you sometimes do lose sight of

984
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,140
that get something out there functional

985
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:38,589
prototype was it POC or get out right

986
00:35:38,589 --> 00:35:41,819
get something out there

987
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:46,059
continuous monitoring this is it this is

988
00:35:46,059 --> 00:35:47,829
the fun part so defining green so what

989
00:35:47,829 --> 00:35:48,339
is good

990
00:35:48,339 --> 00:35:51,099
I mean stops up no one's stealing my

991
00:35:51,099 --> 00:35:52,450
stuff that's good

992
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:54,730
that's that's a that's the happy place

993
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:56,619
that we all like to be in now often

994
00:35:56,619 --> 00:35:57,880
we're in a happy place and we just don't

995
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:02,049
know that everything's red we're just my

996
00:36:02,049 --> 00:36:04,359
dad would say fat dumb and happy no idea

997
00:36:04,359 --> 00:36:05,559
that the world is burning around us

998
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:07,630
because we haven't visibility so the

999
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:10,539
goal is figuring out what that good

1000
00:36:10,539 --> 00:36:13,749
state is and then verifying the state so

1001
00:36:13,749 --> 00:36:16,289
you can say you can say Green is no

1002
00:36:16,289 --> 00:36:19,569
alerts or no messages but if you have no

1003
00:36:19,569 --> 00:36:21,999
alerting or logging setup then you can

1004
00:36:21,999 --> 00:36:23,380
be just as happy as you can be and you

1005
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,999
have no idea that you're getting and

1006
00:36:24,999 --> 00:36:29,170
right but something to remember here

1007
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:30,670
though also is on the other end of the

1008
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:32,319
spectrum continuous monitoring doesn't

1009
00:36:32,319 --> 00:36:34,119
mean that you're checking things every

1010
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:35,499
millisecond or something like that

1011
00:36:35,499 --> 00:36:37,059
because great way to detox for an

1012
00:36:37,059 --> 00:36:39,039
environment or spend it or give Splunk

1013
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:41,440
like a billion dollars for all the logs

1014
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,299
that you generate right but it does need

1015
00:36:43,299 --> 00:36:45,730
to be at some some interval you decided

1016
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:47,170
hey how long was this down before

1017
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:49,720
matters or how long does how long to

1018
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,099
someone having root access or getting

1019
00:36:51,099 --> 00:36:54,220
added to to a privileged group how long

1020
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,660
was that a problem okay how soon would

1021
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,529
you want to know about it

1022
00:36:56,529 --> 00:36:58,239
and then starting to find defying that

1023
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:00,430
and once again verifying it in an

1024
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:01,869
automated way there are a lot of things

1025
00:37:01,869 --> 00:37:05,230
that sis admins and I mean we've done

1026
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:06,670
over the years that just because we

1027
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:08,499
don't have time I mean I mean you want

1028
00:37:08,499 --> 00:37:09,700
to go back and check you want it you

1029
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,079
want to just sit down and be like hey I

1030
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:12,279
should run through some logs see if I

1031
00:37:12,279 --> 00:37:14,019
see anything suspicious I mean right we

1032
00:37:14,019 --> 00:37:15,190
hit that goal it's like I'm sitting

1033
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,839
there like hey you know what I haven't

1034
00:37:16,839 --> 00:37:18,519
checked read it in like 10 minutes

1035
00:37:18,519 --> 00:37:20,200
so I should check that out for the rest

1036
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,749
of the day right yeah well you go with

1037
00:37:22,749 --> 00:37:23,920
your mind like this this is what I want

1038
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,809
to do when I want to provide security to

1039
00:37:25,809 --> 00:37:27,339
my organization but often gets lost

1040
00:37:27,339 --> 00:37:28,299
because there are so many other things

1041
00:37:28,299 --> 00:37:29,970
competing for your time attention and

1042
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:34,960
resources that's what kind of job oh

1043
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,619
yeah

1044
00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:39,579
I wasted one of my trenched I'm sorry so

1045
00:37:39,579 --> 00:37:42,519
yeah so here's the deal with this the

1046
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:44,289
newest monitoring just means if the

1047
00:37:44,289 --> 00:37:45,760
application changed whether your

1048
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,400
purrs did it or whether bad guys did it

1049
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,710
or whether someone plug unplug to cat

1050
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:52,690
power cord somewhere like how would you

1051
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:54,070
know or what and what do you want to

1052
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,570
know about right so the things you want

1053
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:57,040
to know about just effectively

1054
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,740
communicate them to you to the people

1055
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,120
who need to approve those changes to

1056
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:07,360
your to your team to management he said

1057
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,430
he was gonna say tell you I can already

1058
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:15,310
lied he looks like a manager yeah so I

1059
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:16,600
already talked about the nuclear fallout

1060
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,430
thing that was just I just blew my mind

1061
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:19,840
that was one of I was like wow is this

1062
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,430
what was one of my earlier own

1063
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:22,570
engagements the government now is like

1064
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:23,740
this is really how the government works

1065
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:25,330
like you come in and I think we spent

1066
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:27,520
like eight weeks trying to prep this

1067
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,890
site a full team of like five people

1068
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,060
because it's air gap then you gotta like

1069
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:33,760
mainly bringing updates through a very

1070
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,640
secure process right have enough that

1071
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,840
anything in three years we're gonna make

1072
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,460
it very hard for you to updated in the

1073
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,540
amount of time we need to do it but I

1074
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:43,270
mean to me that was just the epitome of

1075
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:44,950
the old data cap process of hey we're

1076
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:46,270
gonna we're gonna make this thing secure

1077
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:47,800
we're gonna check you very well right

1078
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:47,980
now

1079
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,630
we're not gonna talk to you again for

1080
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,490
three years and then we're gonna we're

1081
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:54,400
gonna check you then right interesting

1082
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,340
and also the idea of a cost to secure

1083
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,320
being greater than the asset you're

1084
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,500
securing it does not blow and sometimes

1085
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,640
that's our fault of security people were

1086
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,840
like hey you got to do all this stuff

1087
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,310
you can't do that you can't do this you

1088
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:07,450
guys think it's just like a I have like

1089
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:09,190
10 cents of data on here and it's not

1090
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:11,710
it's not even a if it gets this close is

1091
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:12,880
10 cents of data because sometimes we

1092
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,170
think well hey it's just one social

1093
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:16,390
security number that's all I'm talking

1094
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:18,250
about it yeah usually that happens when

1095
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:19,570
you try to bolt things on at the end

1096
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:22,180
almost always right so if you're in in

1097
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,970
from the beginning obviously you guys

1098
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:26,500
preaching to the choir but yeah the cost

1099
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,480
is always greater I think there's always

1100
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,980
longer if you try to bolt the song at

1101
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:32,380
the end and usually unsuccessful

1102
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:38,290
they usually unsuccessful so the easy

1103
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:40,210
button the easy button would be this to

1104
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:42,100
me walking coming to coming to an

1105
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,570
authorization meeting having spent like

1106
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:47,290
maybe three days or two days gathering

1107
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:49,030
the data the tremendous amounts of

1108
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:50,470
information you have from your

1109
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:53,770
automation to prepare your deploy to

1110
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:54,850
production or to repair your

1111
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:57,190
authorization package like that that to

1112
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,690
me is the easy button because we've done

1113
00:39:58,690 --> 00:39:59,740
all this work up front

1114
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,390
we've gotten the automation in place

1115
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:02,950
with me we've identified critical impact

1116
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:04,570
areas we've said okay this is what we

1117
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:05,980
want to monitor this is the bad state

1118
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,930
this is this is what we want to know

1119
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:09,670
when it goes south right that's

1120
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,470
automated and sent to me this is how we

1121
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:13,300
this is how we approve changes

1122
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,820
throughout our pipeline where we say ok

1123
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:17,230
you mister government official don't

1124
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:18,310
know a single thing about development

1125
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:19,960
but you do care whether or not you have

1126
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,490
a cat one vulnerability in this latest

1127
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:24,369
release so I'm gonna put that in the

1128
00:40:24,369 --> 00:40:25,780
merge ticket because I can automate the

1129
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,250
scan of the software and I can give you

1130
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:29,580
the results in the merge request or

1131
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:32,260
approval web approval processes so you

1132
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,180
have the information you need to make an

1133
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,130
informed decision that is that decision

1134
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:38,190
can be approved and question production

1135
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:40,359
that's a very minimal amount of

1136
00:40:40,359 --> 00:40:41,890
interaction but I mean there there's a

1137
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:43,720
lot behind it but but coming up on that

1138
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,339
authorization process is the same thing

1139
00:40:45,339 --> 00:40:47,020
the same thing applies to where you've

1140
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:49,450
put in the work to identify the critical

1141
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:51,490
areas of your environment which part

1142
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,599
should be more secure than others and

1143
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:54,910
it's the tailoring process it's

1144
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,400
sometimes kind of funny to me because

1145
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,349
knowing how like I work so I'm gonna

1146
00:40:59,349 --> 00:41:01,420
call myself lazy but like you know when

1147
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:02,589
they make controls optional what do you

1148
00:41:02,589 --> 00:41:05,650
do not doing that right so the tailoring

1149
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:07,150
sometimes I think it's a little hard -

1150
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:09,400
it's a little hard to make people do

1151
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,839
because it really is like okay what's

1152
00:41:10,839 --> 00:41:11,950
compliant standard that's what I'm doing

1153
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:13,089
I'm not the only thing else but there's

1154
00:41:13,089 --> 00:41:14,109
a lot of optional stuff where you can

1155
00:41:14,109 --> 00:41:16,330
you can make yourself much more secure

1156
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:17,320
it's kind of like the mall two factor

1157
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,180
authentication I mean we've done for

1158
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,410
years but mana factors an education just

1159
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:21,790
should just do it it's not difficult

1160
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:23,020
there's been products out there for it

1161
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:25,510
but two decades I mean it seems like two

1162
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:27,790
decades probably not two decades long

1163
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:30,220
time yeah baby yeah we haven't been up

1164
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,960
but but if you if you if you put in the

1165
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,849
work and you can come to these like an

1166
00:41:33,849 --> 00:41:35,170
assessment thing an assessment should be

1167
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:37,030
on nearly a blip on your radar but often

1168
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:41,170
we have 12 I don't want to say 12 people

1169
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:42,580
working in the security department very

1170
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:43,810
heavily to prepare for assessments

1171
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:44,859
because we haven't only worked before in

1172
00:41:44,859 --> 00:41:46,839
because it's now it's time well we got

1173
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:48,550
to do the assessment thing again whereas

1174
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:50,230
it should be figuring out okay we're

1175
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:51,550
just gonna gather the information that I

1176
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,560
already have maybe pull pull stuff out

1177
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,150
of our users out of our task management

1178
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,680
export it I'd love to see let me great

1179
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,510
just like click export so you have your

1180
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:00,220
compliance your controls the export that

1181
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:02,410
from your user tasks you have at least

1182
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:04,869
start of your SSP probably a good chunk

1183
00:42:04,869 --> 00:42:06,490
of grass is good if you can convince

1184
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:07,990
developers the document schemes of now

1185
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:10,960
sorry I shouldn't laugh at that

1186
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,490
we try to document things well but we

1187
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:20,910
don't always succeed sorry any questions

1188
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:25,750
this is great like it

1189
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,040
that means we answered all the questions

1190
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:32,060
yeah well thank you yes thank you

1191
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:37,669
[Applause]
