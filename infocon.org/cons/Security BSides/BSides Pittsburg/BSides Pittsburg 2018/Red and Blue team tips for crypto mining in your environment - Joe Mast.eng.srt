1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,410
all right everybody thanks for coming

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:04,049
out to b-sides again and thanks for

3
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:05,700
sticking around for the end for our last

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,379
talk before we wrap things up at five

5
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:10,530
o'clock hmm so it is 4:30 you're in the

6
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,090
black room and we were about to hear

7
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,590
from Joe mast he's going to talk to us

8
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,389
about red and blue team tips for crypto

9
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:17,100
mining in your environment that's all

10
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,369
good man

11
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:25,109
thank you everyone for staying so long I

12
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:26,279
really appreciate it I know it's the end

13
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:28,769
of the day but we'll start to talk off

14
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:31,050
does anybody happen to the characters in

15
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,520
the upper right hand corner your left

16
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,380
sorry and if you do could you raise your

17
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,040
hand so I knows okay good all right so

18
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,660
that show is that Eddie and the plot of

19
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,520
that show every time is there's a scam

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,840
they try to go out and they try to get

21
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,539
free money from all their friends when I

22
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:47,219
started research just researching this

23
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:49,530
talk to me it sounded like one of their

24
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,020
scams but it turned out this scam

25
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,550
actually works and you can get free

26
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,230
money from crypto mining on your works

27
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:56,430
infrastructure so today we're gonna talk

28
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,449
about some tips you can do to do it

29
00:00:57,449 --> 00:00:59,340
better how you can protect against it

30
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,690
and how much money you can really make

31
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:06,570
all right so Who am I

32
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,760
my name is Joe mast I work for federal

33
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,430
investors my undergrads from slippery

34
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,950
rock and I want to I'm doing my masters

35
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,860
at Western Governors University I have

36
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,780
some interest in cryptocurrency cyber

37
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,409
security usually breaking things asking

38
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:24,600
a lot of questions traveling and those

39
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,100
are my cars so if you're into cars let

40
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,450
me know I always like to talk about

41
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,920
those as well so if you don't know

42
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,970
anything about Krypton mining I'm just

43
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,140
gonna give you a brief background about

44
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,110
what cryptocurrency is and as well as

45
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,729
what mining is cryptocurrency is just

46
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:40,560
basically it's a digital currency it's

47
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,450
not regulated it's decentralized I'm

48
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,130
sorry it is regulated it's it's just

49
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,020
decentralized and it's regulated by an

50
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,270
encryption algorithm and there's no

51
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,829
central bank to distribute or operate

52
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:51,810
the currency ie just magic internet

53
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,329
money so you can have fun with that as

54
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:56,159
well where does it come from the short

55
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,049
answer is it's distributed by a minor

56
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:01,049
and a minor just performs a complex math

57
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:03,509
algorithm to verify transactions on the

58
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:05,490
network and by doing that work they're

59
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,049
rewarded with more coins so they're

60
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:08,459
provided the coins for the work that

61
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:11,569
they put into the network

62
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,490
so some perspective where are we coming

63
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,500
from with this talk I just want to give

64
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,860
like an outsider's view again where the

65
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,570
is that if this is this as an outsider

66
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:29,220
there's no oh like key to this it's just

67
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,110
it's mining by even malicious employees

68
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:34,200
or an attacker or a red team so we're

69
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,090
talking about anybody who has access to

70
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,860
your system or potentially could have

71
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,360
access to it and where they're going to

72
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,580
be attacking one your assets to your

73
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,810
power bill and three your free air

74
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:48,060
conditioning so where is the best place

75
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,520
to mine obviously anything with free

76
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,550
power right like a college dorm we've

77
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,410
been seeing that free power is best

78
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,790
power think that all the time everything

79
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,560
that's free you want to take the best

80
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,350
utilization of that that you can

81
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:03,090
colleges are cracking down on it if you

82
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,980
aren't properly logging and auditing

83
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,540
your Amazon Web Services they're also

84
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,890
great place to mind because it's really

85
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,320
easy to set up new devices and spin up

86
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,630
machines and instantly mine there as

87
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,220
well any device that can really run code

88
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:14,670
on it

89
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,110
you can also mind they're pretty fast

90
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,330
and easy and of course your works

91
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,340
desktops workstations and data center

92
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,690
because they're all climate controlled

93
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,220
and maintained by other people other

94
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:28,770
than yourself so this is in my opinion

95
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,990
and many others starting to become like

96
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:32,310
the new ransomware we're seeing it and

97
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,890
why is there a shift from ransomware to

98
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,720
cryptocurrency mining we're seeing that

99
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,820
because this guarantees a return in most

100
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,310
cases I'm sorry not most but in some

101
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,110
cases people don't pay the ransom it's

102
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,580
not guaranteed but if your

103
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,709
cryptocurrency mining software does run

104
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:48,600
you're usually guaranteed some sort of

105
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,930
return as well we've seen a lot of

106
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,820
resources where botnets have been

107
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,680
repurposed from doing malicious things

108
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,540
to running cryptocurrency miners and

109
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,459
then generating a slow profit for the

110
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:01,410
the owner as well

111
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,330
popular ransomware tools I've been

112
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,880
repurposed one such one was the eternal

113
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,920
blue attack with wanna cry had been

114
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,650
repurposed to one of mine so it's just

115
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,730
there's a lot of different tools out

116
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,620
there they all exist they use the same

117
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,970
bar abilities as regular ransomware

118
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:17,100
tools as well it provides a long-term

119
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,950
strategy for an attacker and what that

120
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,169
strategy provides is over

121
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:23,880
with a ransomware it's like a one-hit

122
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,710
wonder you're out you get your money you

123
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:26,610
leave but

124
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,020
the long-term strategy here is you can

125
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,370
mine over a long period of time and go

126
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,680
ahead and that's also how it draws less

127
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,569
attention you're just on the system and

128
00:04:33,569 --> 00:04:35,520
constantly draining and using resources

129
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:44,639
to gain money for yourself over time so

130
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,849
mining costs money and this is where I

131
00:04:46,849 --> 00:04:49,139
took into account for the power bill and

132
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:51,270
analyzed it I have a home lab right now

133
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,639
with two Dell are seven ten servers and

134
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:55,560
what I did with this is an experiment to

135
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,689
see how much money the power cost really

136
00:04:57,689 --> 00:05:01,050
did or were for my month right so I kind

137
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,719
of took into account two different sized

138
00:05:03,719 --> 00:05:05,129
firms a small and a large

139
00:05:05,129 --> 00:05:07,289
at the small firm we had 250

140
00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:10,319
workstations and 50 work and 50 servers

141
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:12,779
and the average cost per day for a

142
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,909
workstation was around a quarter and for

143
00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:17,150
the server's around $2 a day in power

144
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,340
over the course of the year I ended up

145
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,469
calculating that it was around 22,000

146
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:24,689
dollars per year for all your

147
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:26,250
workstations at a small firm and around

148
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:31,589
36,000 a year for all the servers where

149
00:05:31,589 --> 00:05:32,969
it really starts to get serious is in a

150
00:05:32,969 --> 00:05:34,710
larger firm the more workstations you

151
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,000
have obviously it's gonna cost a lot

152
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,650
more with 5,000 workstations it's

153
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:39,180
somewhere near a half a million dollars

154
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,969
in power costs as well more servers you

155
00:05:41,969 --> 00:05:44,099
have they'd if I cost a lot more so it's

156
00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:45,120
almost three-quarters of a million

157
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,860
dollars in power for a thousand servers

158
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,120
and this is just an assumption that

159
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,039
you're getting a commercial rate of

160
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:51,150
power if you're doing this at your house

161
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,860
or something along those lines to be

162
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,449
even worse than your rates are gonna be

163
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:56,279
way higher than this and this doesn't

164
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:57,779
take into account air conditioning

165
00:05:57,779 --> 00:05:59,129
maintenance and other things related to

166
00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:05,250
maintaining your own hardware so how

167
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,020
easy is it can you click run and paste

168
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,330
your wallet address that's really how

169
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,069
easy it is to run some JavaScript miners

170
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:13,199
in the browser they're there honestly

171
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,029
just if you can load a web page you can

172
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:17,039
load a binder it's so easy a baby could

173
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,680
do it for more contour for more

174
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,789
dedicated miners you might have to run

175
00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:26,069
an executable on an endpoint but there's

176
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:27,479
not really much configuration just to

177
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:29,400
get it up and running to optimize it yes

178
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,430
there's more configuration and need for

179
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,389
permissions but you can usually get it

180
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:35,159
running in an environment where there's

181
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:37,649
not a lot of protection as well things

182
00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:39,630
you need to mind just internet a device

183
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,470
that works

184
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:43,940
a border more need for some free money

185
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,910
so free money is best money what are we

186
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:50,190
talking about we're gonna take into

187
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,780
account the small firm we saw earlier

188
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,310
and with that small firm we had 50

189
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:55,620
servers and 250 endpoints this is where

190
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,730
things started to get serious and you

191
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,920
can see there's actual returns generated

192
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,710
and why someone might want to do this so

193
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,810
what the server we're looking at a hash

194
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,850
rate of 300 hashes per second that's

195
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,740
very conservative and low for an average

196
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,370
grade server just doing CPU mining as

197
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,930
well this workstation accounts for just

198
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,460
an eight-hour day so that's why you can

199
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,870
see the daily yields are lower for the

200
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,090
workstation so I'm on two different

201
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:21,480
coins in my lab on the servers and the

202
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,580
workstations that I had and the daily

203
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,850
yield for the smaller sorry the Monaro

204
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:30,000
was 18 cents and z cache was 62 cents

205
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,470
which is quite profitable at the time

206
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:34,950
still is on the workstations as well

207
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,150
since we're just planning for an

208
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,860
eight-hour workday I was able to earn

209
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,419
around five cents and seventeen cents

210
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:42,600
for Z cache where this really comes into

211
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,580
effect is if you can do this for a long

212
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,260
period of time for over a large amount

213
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,600
of assets three to five thousand dollars

214
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,640
is nice and so is Z cash is fifteen two

215
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,430
to eleven thousand dollars but it's not

216
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,750
something crazy and I don't think I

217
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,100
would want to lose my job over that much

218
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,650
money but where this is the small fry

219
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:00,419
right this is like you have a small

220
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:02,370
organization you take over it but it's

221
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,080
still a lot of money for people to go

222
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,180
mind for right so this is the small fry

223
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:11,520
but wait there's more the large firm is

224
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,919
where the returns really come out what

225
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,700
these numbers is they grow largely

226
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,890
so that the same hash rates we're

227
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,870
getting the same yield depending on your

228
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,940
assets if you can control obviously as

229
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,700
you can see here a thousand servers from

230
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,080
an arrow that's sixty five thousand

231
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,460
dollars your current market rates which

232
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,590
are pretty low right now as well for Z

233
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:33,570
cash that's two hundred twenty six

234
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,520
thousand dollars a year which is some

235
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,380
serious change if you can do that on all

236
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,270
your endpoints and this is just a very

237
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:42,450
unwise mining level as well for our

238
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,740
workstations it's almost a hundred

239
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,089
thousand dollars a year and three

240
00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:47,700
hundred thousand dollars a year for Z

241
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,770
cash and that's some it's Lamba money

242
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:50,760
you can go out buy anything you want

243
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,420
with that I can see why

244
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,060
people have been mining on their works

245
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,980
infrastructure and this is just to get

246
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,470
you to think about one it's possible -

247
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:05,430
it has serious returns three just if you

248
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,310
can do it it's easy and simple to run

249
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,720
and there's obviously money to be made

250
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,779
here

251
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,050
so with this there's broad attack

252
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:18,000
surfaces only I know meant we before

253
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,370
mentioned that the web browsers but as

254
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,139
well with most of these monitors there's

255
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:23,850
not much privileged access needed to

256
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:26,009
make them run at least in from a basic

257
00:09:26,009 --> 00:09:28,019
standpoint as well you can mine in the

258
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:29,940
browser via JavaScript if you're not

259
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,550
blocking that and another friend of mine

260
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,350
proposed an idea and I've seen attacks

261
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,130
made for it

262
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,589
where web proxies are attacked and then

263
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:38,970
used to inject the JavaScript directly

264
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:42,839
to users browser pages as well Internet

265
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:44,519
of Things devices have been used and

266
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,529
manipulated to mine consistently because

267
00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:47,910
no one's really checking on them are

268
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,079
looking at what they're doing all the

269
00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:49,440
time

270
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,269
a popular attack those just released was

271
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:53,759
for kindle fire sticks Amazon fire

272
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,190
sticks as well as we've seen the

273
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:58,500
repurposed botnets just to go out and

274
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,459
earn money for themselves and mine and

275
00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:04,920
then we've seen a lot of from ransomware

276
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,579
fishing to go to mining and that it's

277
00:10:08,579 --> 00:10:10,740
been either a link to a web page

278
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,779
JavaScript miner in it or an executable

279
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,819
for some type of miner that runs on a

280
00:10:14,819 --> 00:10:15,930
browser page it's hidden in the

281
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:18,540
background so it's very easy to attack

282
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:22,380
multiple surfaces with this so we're in

283
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,990
team how can you make more money or do

284
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:27,360
this better when I was doing this I just

285
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,100
pretended it was malware in my

286
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,980
environment my test environment most

287
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,959
antivirus software thought that it was

288
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:37,199
or at least a malicious item and in

289
00:10:37,199 --> 00:10:38,880
order to get to run some cases I used

290
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,579
off UK obfuscation techniques I use PE

291
00:10:41,579 --> 00:10:44,670
scrambler to obfuscate the executable

292
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:47,040
and then run it Pig got past most

293
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,259
signature-based antivirus software as

294
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:52,439
well thing was important if you have

295
00:10:52,439 --> 00:10:54,630
really good server admins that are

296
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,130
always on there and understand the

297
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,959
utilization of your servers and when

298
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:00,420
they should be working hard not you you

299
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,519
can tune around within most miners such

300
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:04,829
as reducing how much CPU power it uses

301
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:07,740
and as well having an only worked

302
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,240
normal work hours so it doesn't look odd

303
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,040
and on mobile clients you can as well

304
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,410
work to work towards battery power so

305
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,520
that doesn't look odd if it gets below

306
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,410
20% maybe it stops mine things along

307
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:22,140
those lines as well you can tune your

308
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,430
phishing attacks you don't need to go

309
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,170
dropping executables on somebody's thing

310
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:28,230
you can just go and drop a JavaScript

311
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:31,320
infected link and mine via the browser

312
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,970
there if they just click on it you're

313
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:36,090
gonna make some sort of return as well

314
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:38,520
almost all Meyers were able to be loaded

315
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,290
via SMB shares just like normal malware

316
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:42,870
if your antivirus software doesn't know

317
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,900
how to scan those that was very simple

318
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,580
to load those in most of my lab

319
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:52,680
environments blue team what can you do

320
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,460
to prevent and detect this at first I

321
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,410
would definitely say that your company

322
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,090
should have a formal stamp established

323
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02,670
against this or it doesn't have to be

324
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,410
exactly crypto mining but maybe a

325
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:06,180
hardware software abuse and if you don't

326
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,230
have that already you should definitely

327
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:10,350
have one drafted as well you can employ

328
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:12,810
a next-gen firewall and with that it's

329
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,190
great to have a next-gen firewall but

330
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,480
you should be using the tools that it

331
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,580
has on it and implement them such as URL

332
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,560
filtering or SSL interception or

333
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,820
decryption as well you should employ an

334
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,890
intrusion detection system keep it

335
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:28,050
updated ensure that somebody's actually

336
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:30,090
read the alerts that it produces that's

337
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:31,560
great to have it again but you should

338
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,700
pay attention to what it's doing it's

339
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,310
probably doing a good job and then as

340
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:38,430
well implement a strong antivirus or erd

341
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,740
solution and update it keep it updated

342
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,540
with roles and ifcs

343
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:48,480
and just watch it as well you can check

344
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,420
out this point blocker list tool and

345
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,560
what that coin blocker list tool does is

346
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,500
it produces a list of IPs which all

347
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,990
contain every node in the coin hive

348
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:01,800
JavaScript miner that's built into the

349
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,780
browser and you can use that to

350
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,970
implement it downloads as a text file

351
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:08,580
you can upload that to your tools and

352
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,740
then block those IP addresses that for

353
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,480
those web addresses as well you can

354
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,040
patch your browsers and install block

355
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,210
browser plugins if you don't have any

356
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:17,760
other protections and some of those

357
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,130
plugins are no coin and miner block and

358
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,600
what they'll do is they'll just think

359
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,730
they have known mining signatures in

360
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:24,810
them and then they'll just block those

361
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:28,380
scripts from running as well talked

362
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,670
before one of the ways I was able to get

363
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,920
lowest mining software to run in my labs

364
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,460
and other areas I played with is through

365
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,070
attached storage or shares if your

366
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:39,750
antivirus software or your D solution

367
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,400
isn't configured properly to scan that

368
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,140
it's very simple to just have it run

369
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,630
through there so I found a lot of evil

370
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,550
if you just scan most attached storage

371
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,870
or shares there's lots of interesting

372
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,070
things out there and you should probably

373
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:52,110
be doing that and as well you should

374
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,940
have a process to properly validate your

375
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,830
firewall rules and what's going on there

376
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,930
if you're not properly validating

377
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:59,160
checking the configuration or saying

378
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,690
what's going on how do you know what's

379
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,550
really happening on your firewall so

380
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,870
there should be some sort of audit

381
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,610
function third-party that knows what's

382
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:10,350
going on there as well just before we

383
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,970
wrap this up I wanted to go over some

384
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:14,250
recent news there's some interesting

385
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:17,010
links for the first one is the Georgia

386
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:19,370
Department of State some man mined over

387
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:23,100
$300,000 in Z cash I think it was and he

388
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,230
was caught he was asked to leave he

389
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,880
never actually got fired and he ended up

390
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,680
keeping the money too so it sounds

391
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,890
pretty sweet to me for the second one is

392
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:34,290
it was just a post on Stack Overflow a

393
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,570
colleague found that his friend was

394
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,700
mining on the company resources he's

395
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,990
asked him what to do the comments are

396
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:42,360
great if you read that one and then the

397
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,590
last one is a Russian guy that doesn't

398
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:46,550
he went missing he was mining on

399
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:50,070
supercomputers at a Russian State

400
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:54,270
University and then just to go over

401
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:57,240
again some pros and cons here it's free

402
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,490
money what there's no reason not to do

403
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:01,140
it and it's pretty simple and easy to

404
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:04,020
install you just Google how to mine you

405
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,310
can probably figure it out pretty simply

406
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:08,310
and some cons if your environment set up

407
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,780
right you might be privileged access to

408
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,970
do this more properly as well if your

409
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:13,980
firewall set up well you might need to

410
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,090
whitelist something in there but if you

411
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,770
have access to it it could be easy to do

412
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:19,050
and you might get fired I haven't really

413
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:20,250
seen many cases where people got fired

414
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:23,940
though so just things to think about and

415
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,160
just things to leave you with again it's

416
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,110
easy to do you should have a policy

417
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:32,840
against this and free thank you

418
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:39,179
[Applause]

419
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:42,920
anybody mind questions

420
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:51,620
so yes there are I don't know them off

421
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,300
by heart but I know that in most

422
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,220
firewalls there's the ability to I know

423
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,320
Apollo out there signatures for it that

424
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,780
you can enable to blocking with URL

425
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:04,330
filtering in SSL decryption great

426
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:10,630
application so thank you anybody else

427
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:23,870
yes there is an IOC list one of my

428
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,160
friends was talking about a tool that

429
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,380
you can download it and what it'll do is

430
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,400
it'll give you a list of all the IP

431
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,810
addresses to know in pools and then you

432
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:30,800
can block those because they're all

433
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,210
communicating back out to those pools

434
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:34,520
but there is known public things that

435
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,110
you can go and download to produce with

436
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,910
an IP list for you to implement into

437
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:41,860
your tools to block them no minor tools

438
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:46,870
thank you everyone

439
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:52,039
[Applause]
