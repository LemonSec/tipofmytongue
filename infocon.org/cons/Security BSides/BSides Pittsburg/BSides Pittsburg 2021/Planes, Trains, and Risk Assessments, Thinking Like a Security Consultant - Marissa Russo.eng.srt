10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,760
marissa i'm really excited to be here

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,080
today a long time volunteer first time

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,279
talking so thank you for joining me

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,679
my talk is called planes trains and risk

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,600
assessments and the reason why i chose

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,440
this talk is twofold

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,760
number one people glamorize travel when

17
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,000
you're a consultant i'm happy to talk to

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,559
anybody about that uh i hated it

19
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,120
i didn't hate it uh but it just wasn't

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,000
for me

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,480
um but number two when you're a security

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,559
consultant you're really required to

23
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,640
think holistically

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,879
when i saw b-side started an industry

25
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,719
challenges track i wanted to show

26
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,320
security practitioners that not only do

27
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,320
we have the fast-paced realm of i.t

28
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,199
security and cyber security technology

29
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,960
but we need to check our foundational

30
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,200
skills you may not realize this but

31
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,960
sometimes the way you approach things

32
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,360
may be the barrier between you and

33
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,479
accurately assessing risk

34
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:17,920
so the things that we're going to review

35
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,840
today aren't super technical they're

36
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,400
small tips and tricks that i learned

37
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,960
and they are able to help me fully and

38
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,640
accurately assess risk within an

39
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,240
organization

40
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,159

41
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,000
of consulting projects but you can

42
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,920

thank you

68
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,840
before before i was at cso in wit i was

69
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,319
a senior sap

70
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,080
sap security and grc consultant

71
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,760
where i got to learn these skills from

72
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,160
the best of the best at a big four and i

73
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,640
got to travel to like 10 countries and

74
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,040
most us states it was really fun and

75
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,080
exciting for that time of my life

76
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,440
and then

77
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,000
my industries were technology healthcare

78
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,760
food and beverage those were the ones

79
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,159
that i primarily worked in

80
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,800

81
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,640
i if i like you i've cooked for you

82
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,080
before

83
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,080
i love to work out i go to mecca fitness

84
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,000

85
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,840
there and then

86
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,840
travel i was trying to do 30 countries

87
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,400
before i'm 30 but unfortunately kovid

88
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,440
set that off i'm stuck at 19.

89
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,440
if you look up there that's my dog tulip

90
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,239
uh i foster failed her earlier this year

91
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,040
that's my boyfriend um and she was not

92
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,360
super excited to be picked up but i love

93
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,519
that photo

94
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,239
all right

95
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,319
so before we get started uh on our deep

96
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,720
dive i really wanted to level set and

97
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,879
talk about what exactly security

98
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,720
consulting is i think my favorite

99
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,080
question when i tell people that i'm a

100
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,640
consultant is what do comments do a lot

101
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,798
of people don't really fully understand

102
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,360
so i think when you're a consultant

103
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,879
security consultant you have three main

104
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,239
objectives

105
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,080
your first objective is to assess

106
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,080
implement and redesign security measures

107
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,280
so

108
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,400
when you're talking about

109
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,319
implementations it could mean

110
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,480
implementing anything secure coding

111
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,000
process standing up vulnerability

112
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,640
scanners i do grc so i do governance

113
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,200
procedures processes things like that

114
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,320
so what you start with is either with a

115
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,560
client who doesn't have anything and

116
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,400
you're going to give them something or

117
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,840
they have a tool and maybe they're not

118
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,560
using it appropriately to best practice

119
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,560
or maybe they're not using the full

120
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,320
extent of their tool so you're just

121
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,600
going to help them

122
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,080
get using use their tools to their best

123
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,840
ability

124
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,400
then next is the things we know and love

125
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,000
finding threats and vulnerabilities and

126
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,120
remediating them and then most near and

127
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,320
dear to me

128
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,080
in i.t security is the cia triad

129
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,400
confident confidentiality integrity

130
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,240
integrity and availability of data

131
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,919
and i want to mention that also when

132
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,199
we're talking about this we're talking

133
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,320
about true consulting there's sometimes

134
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,320
when we talk about true consulting it is

135
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,479
project based so has a clear scope

136
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,560
beginning middle and end sometimes when

137
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,160
you talk about consulting you're stuck

138
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,320
talking about staff augmentation which

139
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,000
is you go and you fill a role for a

140
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,039
couple months until they find a

141
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,720
full-time employee

142
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,960
what we're talking about is experts

143
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,560
knowing things and doing them within a

144
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,880
client

145
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,320
so

146
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,280
next is soft skills and i personally do

147
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,800
not believe that we talk about soft

148
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,639
skills enough in it in general and soft

149
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,039
skills when you're in consulting is the

150
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,960
most important part of your job

151
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,880
my theory is if you're a good consultant

152
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,560
you could literally not know anything

153
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,280
and your way out of anything

154
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,199
and go and google and find the answer

155
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,199
later

156
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,199
so talking about some of the soft skills

157
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,199
that i really appreciate in consulting

158
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,280
number one is leadership you want to

159
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,880
lead your clients you want them to be

160
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,720
confident in you and you also want your

161
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,800
teams to be confident in you if they

162
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,479
believe that you can get them there and

163
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,080
you actually should be able to get them

164
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,680
there then you're going to have a really

165
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,160
good working relationship

166
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,960
next is charisma if you don't look like

167
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,039
you want to be there your clients don't

168
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,520
need to hire you back to be there

169
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,039
so having charisma and being

170
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,800
enthusiastic about what you're doing is

171
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,240
really important especially in

172
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,840
consulting when you're doing it over and

173
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,319
over again

174
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,199
third is reading between the lines

175
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,319
this is

176
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,080
the most important soft skill that you

177
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,319
have in consulting

178
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,800
in business we talk about people process

179
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,240
and technology

180
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,560
and in people process and technology

181
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,000
those are the ways that you need to

182
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,919
solve solve skills solve problems so in

183
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,400
a security practitioner's example let's

184
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,479
say somebody comes up to you and says

185
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,720
hey my employees passwords are being

186
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,600
hacked

187
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,280
what is your first

188
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,560
thought

189
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,639
probably put in a technical control

190
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,800
multi-factor authentication

191
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,080
something like that

192
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,680
but when you go back to people process

193
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,080
and technology you might realize that it

194
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,919
might not need a technical control you

195
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,160
might just need to train your people

196
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,160
so if you train your people not to give

197
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,080
away their passwords how to you know

198
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,240
stop phishing attempts things like that

199
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,080
then you're able to read between those

200
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,000
lines and solve their problems because

201
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,360
maybe they can't afford a technical

202
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,720
control or maybe that's just not right

203
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,280
for them right now

204
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,919
and then finally adaptability

205
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,599
adaptability is extremely important

206
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,039
because when you're a consultant you

207
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,680
have a specific timeline to do things

208
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,360
and sometimes you go down a path and you

209
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,360
realize it's not working but you still

210
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,840
have to finish by november 30th so what

211
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,120
you should do

212
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,520
is stop take a step back and realize

213
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,039
that what you're doing isn't working and

214
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,280
reassess and move forward

215
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,720
sometimes doing that can really hurt

216
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,280
your pride so when you're adaptable and

217
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,680
you realize that it's just part of life

218
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,520
that makes you more flexible and able to

219
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,159
solve problems

220
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,919
all right so talking about what types of

221
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,520
jobs are out there i literally just

222
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,879
googled this some of these things i

223
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,879
don't know what they are but i just

224
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,720
really the point of this was to show

225
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,560
that when you're talking about security

226
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,319
consulting you could anything you can do

227
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,120
in industry you can do as a consultant

228
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,319
if you're really good at it the

229
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,680
redundancy might be great for you

230
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,960
sometimes people don't like that they

231
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,720
don't like doing projects but personally

232
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,720
for me i like having a beginning and end

233
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,319
i like starting over and solving

234
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,960
different problems

235
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,239
yep so these are the types of jobs

236
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,240
all right so to make sure we're on the

237
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,479
same page i wanted to walk you through

238
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,120
exactly the steps of like a consulting

239
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,599
project realization

240
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,839
because we will be walking through what

241
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,719
a consulting project is

242
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,080
so

243
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,959
here

244
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,279
you have your client identifying a gap

245
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,279
this gap could be a risk that they found

246
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,800
when they were looking in their systems

247
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,399
they could be a new company and they

248
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,839
just want to you know start thinking

249
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,480
about security it could be from a third

250
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,600
party

251
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,600
let's say that they want to work with a

252
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,120
government contractor and that

253
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,560
government contractor says that they

254
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,600
need to be

255
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,560
cmmc compliant or something like that so

256
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,959
first the client identifies a gap

257
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,279
and then the consulting a consulting

258
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,360
firm creates a proposal this could be

259
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,959
you have a good relationship with them

260
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,839
and they want to hire you or they could

261
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,000
put out a request for proposal which is

262
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,240
an rf it's called an rfp and that's

263
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,760
where people throw numbers around and

264
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,519
pitch things

265
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,959
client makes a decision who they want to

266
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,080
work with

267
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,680
then they hire a consulting firm to do

268
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,680
the work

269
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,160
if you see this fun lit up

270
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,399
box here this is where we're going to be

271
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,680
living in the context of our

272
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,959
presentation

273
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,200
so first you have an assessment

274
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,760
assessment kicks off you do interviews

275
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,519
you do the technical assessment you

276
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,040
create a report

277
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,360
recommendations are proposed

278
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,360
the client accepts your recommendations

279
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,839
and then the implementation work starts

280
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,560
this is extremely straightforward

281
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,480
a lot of things can go wrong in this

282
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,360
piece

283
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,519
let's say that you

284
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:02,959
don't do a good job you make

285
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,560
recommendations but your client doesn't

286
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,120
like the way that you went about that

287
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,720
they could go with another consulting

288
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,440
firm and you know not look at you so

289
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,839
this is an extremely straightforward

290
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,839
workflow

291
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,240
all right so

292
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,600
let's get our project started

293
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,320
our client puts forth a request for

294
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,000
proposal um and that is the client wants

295
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,560
to become iso compliant due to a third

296
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,200
party requirement and they need an

297
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,720
assessment completed to have a better

298
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,480
understanding in order to become

299
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,120
compliant

300
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,079
so congratulations everybody we won the

301
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:45,279
assessment

302
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,120
so it's time to get started

303
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,040
so it's really important to point out

304
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,720
that risk is not arbitrary risk is not

305
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,560
arbitrary there's a lot of thought

306
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,480
leaders in this room who probably

307
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,800
believe that things are riskier than

308
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,040
they might be or have different opinions

309
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,440
about how risky things could be

310
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,079
but when we're talking about clients we

311
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,160
need to make sure that we're always

312
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,720
working towards best practice there

313
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,360
always needs to be a framework

314
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,320
something

315
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,560
regulation scoring system something like

316
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,320
that to talk about

317
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,360
everybody's least favorite word

318
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,320
is

319
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,640
because the auditor said so

320
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,640
everybody hates that

321
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,880
so when we say risk isn't arbitrary you

322
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,200
should always use a framework regulation

323
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,800
or scoring system when discussing with

324
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,720
your clients

325
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,839
so how do we know which one to

326
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,360
use with the client in our example

327
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,880
somebody told them they need to be iso

328
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,399
compliant so they're going to try to be

329
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,240
iso compliant but that might not always

330
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,440
be the case

331
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,000
you might come with a client who says

332
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,880
oh i want to be cmmc level 5 and they've

333
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,360
never done security before in their life

334
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,760
so you need to make sure that you are

335
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,839
communicating and honest and upfront

336
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,800
with them that hey maybe cmmc 5 is not

337
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,360
achievable let's start with ranking you

338
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,040
at a cmmc3

339
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,320
do the analysis and see where that goes

340
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,920
so being open and honest with your

341
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,000
clients about what is acceptable will

342
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,040
help build that trust

343
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,560
all right so now we're going to start

344
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,040
our interviews with the client

345
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,720
so what interviews are going to do is

346
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,160
help you better understand what's

347
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,279
happening

348
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,040
and it's really important to make sure

349
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,839
that your interviewees feel at ease

350
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,079
when you come in and you're a security

351
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,480
consultant the first thing people are

352
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,000
going to think is that you're here for

353
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,519
their jobs

354
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,399
and fortunately in our in security we're

355
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,200
not

356
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,440
typically there to cut out jobs that's

357
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,560
what management consultants do uh just

358
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,600
kidding i actually don't know what

359
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,519
management consultants do

360
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,680
i just heard they cut jobs

361
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,800
um but so

362
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,560
starting off with a light conversation

363
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,240
finding things in common making sure

364
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,760
everybody's relaxed before going into

365
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,120
the interviews is definitely going to

366
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,480
make sure that you're getting the most

367
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,079
accurate answers

368
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,839
if you look up here you can see i have

369
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,279
animal crackers

370
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,079
one time i went to germany italy and the

371
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,160
czech republic and we had to do

372
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,680
workshops there

373
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,200
we flew with an entire suitcase packed

374
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,519
with these things these frosted animal

375
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,399
crackers and that was a really good ice

376
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,600
breaker for us because we could you know

377
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,360
we were like oh hey have you ever tried

378
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,399
these before

379
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,959
and the overall analysis was they were

380
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,639
too sweet because that's what everybody

381
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,959
in europe says about american snacks but

382
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,880
it really helped us form a relationship

383
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,199
especially in a place where maybe not

384
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,199
everybody speaks the language the same

385
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,880
language as you we had to use

386
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,800
translators but this was a really good

387
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,079
way to help bridge that gap

388
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,199
so making the interviews feel at ease

389
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:58,240
and then

390
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,519
second is recognizing not everybody is a

391
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,920
security expert making sure you level

392
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,440
set and come prepared with direct

393
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,519
questions is really going to help you in

394
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,040
the long run

395
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,800
even if the conversation doesn't go that

396
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,000
way if they are security experts

397
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,519
i like to use this conference as an

398
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,560
example

399
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,880
i meet a lot of people here who are

400
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,519
super passionate about a lot of things

401
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,040
but they don't really level set they

402
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,959
don't ask me my knowledge you know and

403
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,120
they start talking at me and even though

404
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,279
they're really excited i can't express

405
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,720
the same amount of excitement because i

406
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,560
don't really know what's going on and i

407
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,560
leave that conversation feeling you know

408
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,160
a little off

409
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,760
and that's not what we want to do

410
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,440
because people are less likely to talk

411
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,920
to you and be honest with you if they're

412
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,800
not sure exactly what's going on

413
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,360
so if you can recognize those gaps and

414
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,040
come from a place of knowledge and

415
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,360
collaboration and understanding you're

416
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,959
definitely more likely to get the

417
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,240
information that you want out of those

418
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,720
interviews

419
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,959
and then finally and this i think is the

420
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,120
most important part always make sure

421
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,959
you're asking for evidence those

422
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,560
evidence could be design documents

423
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,560
like posts excuse me post incident

424
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,959
reports network diagrams all those

425
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,560
things

426
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,320
we're not auditors we're not here to

427
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,000
comb through and tell them everything

428
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,800
that's wrong but what you can do is you

429
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,079
know double check and make sure that

430
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,440
they're actually doing what they say

431
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,160
they're

432
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,319
they're doing

433
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,639
all right so understanding the types of

434
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,000
folks you'll be interviewing it is an

435
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,920
important strategy to also produce

436
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,399
produce the most accurate information

437
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,160
i picked the four biggest archetypes

438
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,199
that i see

439
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,480
i would like to note that these are just

440
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,240
archetypes that i made up i am not

441
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,000
coming to attack anybody in this room

442
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,000
um

443
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,320
so you should be able to identify the

444
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,639
type of person when we're when you're in

445
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,040
that kind of pre-conversation where

446
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,639
you're trying to make them feel at ease

447
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,320
you know they might say oh hey this is

448
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,759
something that i'm really good at or hey

449
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,279
this is something that maybe i don't

450
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,399
have a lot of information about

451
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:05,440
so we're going to start off with

452
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,880
security sal

453
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,399
i recognize that some people in this

454
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,480
room might be security sal where they

455
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,800
have a program that they set up and it's

456
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,720
their baby and they've done so much with

457
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,000
it or maybe they just came in and you

458
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,680
know they're kind of

459
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,000
at odds because this isn't you know

460
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,199
they're still trying to understand the

461
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,120
program things like that

462
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,199
he may be ready for this change or he

463
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,079
may think that you're here for his job

464
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:30,880
so

465
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,880
i think that the best approach for this

466
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,160
person is to be really interactive with

467
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:36,959
them

468
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,160
and don't call them out so recognizing

469
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,320
their strengths is super important and

470
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,880
using those to your advantages and when

471
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,720
you talk about their weak points you

472
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,720
need to use that as a point of

473
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,040
opportunity to help you build

474
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,000
so when security style is like

475
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,720
oh yeah i bet you know maybe

476
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,639
this is something that i really want to

477
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,880
improve on jot that down and have it in

478
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,519
your findings because that's a way that

479
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,119
you can help build that trust and build

480
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,039
that relationship and then he knows that

481
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,760
you're here to help

482
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,359
next is

483
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,319
annie

484
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,240
anxious annie is probably part of the

485
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,839
business

486
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,079
hr is somebody that we we talk with a

487
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,240
lot maybe finance i used to do socks

488
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,359
controls

489
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,599
and anxious annie has no idea why

490
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,760
they're why she's there and she doesn't

491
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,840
think that her job has anything to do

492
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,840
with cyber security i.t security

493
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,600
anything like that

494
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,000
i think the best approach is coming with

495
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,600
really direct and straightforward

496
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,160
questions get in get out get going and

497
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,320
also using this as a chance to explain

498
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,440
to her

499
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,799
why exactly she's there so making sure

500
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,400
that they understand their role in

501
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,120
security while also being really direct

502
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,120
and straightforward will make them feel

503
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,520
like they actually understand okay i'm a

504
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,760
puzzle piece and this is how i fit

505
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,720
exactly into this world

506
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,960
next we have talkative tom

507
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,720
um talkative tom will tell you

508
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,559
everything about the company things that

509
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,720
he does not believe he should be telling

510
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,200
you things that you know maybe he tells

511
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,799
you about the bagel he ate for breakfast

512
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,160
this morning um talkative tom is really

513
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,240
just likes to talk and i know we talked

514
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,919
about collecting evidence

515
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,760
if something sounds too good to be true

516
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,440
it probably is

517
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,120
so definitely making sure that you're

518
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,240
going back and you're double checking

519
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,440
exactly what he's saying is the truth

520
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,679
before you trust everything that he says

521
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,160
and then my final archetype is ceo carl

522
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,919
i'm not talking about my boss joe over

523
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:42,960
here

524
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,039
but ceo carl is

525
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,160
obligatory older white man

526
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,919
so ceo carl

527
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,520
is probably funding this project and

528
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,120
wants to make sure that everything goes

529
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,440
super smoothly

530
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,240
ceo carl probably got in his role

531
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,240
because he knows best practice and

532
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,760
that's probably what he's going to tell

533
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,160
you is happening within his company he's

534
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,160
not going to recognize that there might

535
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,360
be gaps because he doesn't work and see

536
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,520
the everyday he's signing off on process

537
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,600
documents he's signing off on risks you

538
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,679
know he's giving money to these programs

539
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:16,799
so he's going to tell you that

540
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,720
everything is operating smoothly and

541
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,760
exactly as intended

542
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,480
the problem with ceo carl is if he's in

543
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,919
the room when you're interviewing

544
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,360
everybody else what are they going to do

545
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,960
they're going to lie they're going to

546
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,280
say that their program is running great

547
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,200
and everything is wonderful because they

548
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,799
don't want ceo carl to think that

549
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,120
they're not doing their jobs so making

550
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,720
sure that he's not in the room during

551
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,320
these interviews is really going to help

552
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,159
you get the most accurate information

553
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,720
all right

554
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,600
so

555
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,760
we got our information um let's get our

556
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,879
presentation ready

557
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,600
so the art of not surprising and

558
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,360
building trust

559
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,039
your final presentation should not be

560
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,640
the first time that everybody is seeing

561
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,240
what you're offering

562
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,280
i put some ideas of the way that you can

563
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,200
give these

564
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,960
updates having regular status meetings

565
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,280
giving draft reviews

566
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,120
working sessions as you're producing the

567
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,760
report or you know at the end of every

568
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,799
interview maybe working with them

569
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,520
but i think the for the best

570
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,960
bang for your buck it's going to be

571
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,320
quick wins

572
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,919
what a quick win is is something that

573
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,000
wouldn't be an entire project

574
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,320
um i'm gonna use brandon for an example

575
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,159
um brandon

576
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,000
had a security awareness program that he

577
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
hasn't put forward yet

578
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,370
i hope that's okay brandon

579
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,120
[Applause]

580
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,720
um

581
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,159
so

582
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:51,840
yeah he has a security awareness program

583
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,480
and a quick win is hey publish this

584
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,200
that's definitely um one of the things

585
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,400
that

586
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,159
uh you could do that's like this is

587
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,240
really quick get that forward and you're

588
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,120
going to check that box

589
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,400
also another little push maybe they're

590
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,159
working on a proposed aren't excuse me

591
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:11,760
non-proposal procedure documents that

592
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,360
they haven't published yet something

593
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,559
like that

594
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,400
and what that does is really show that

595
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,159
you care because you do care about your

596
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:19,679
clients um

597
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,520
you really do care about the things that

598
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,960
they do

599
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,080
and you really want them to know that so

600
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,960
it's not just here for money

601
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,400
all right so

602
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,320
when trying to communicate risk to a

603
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,960
group it's really important that it's

604
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,960
easy to understand

605
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,520
the way that i like to do this the most

606
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,120
is using an impact matrix

607
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,200
starting with

608
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,760
high high impact low effort and working

609
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,200
your way around

610
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,320
so a lot of the times

611
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,080
the people that you're delivering to

612
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,080
they're probably high level maybe one

613
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,280
person in the room is the person that

614
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,840
you've been working with but um

615
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,360
they might not be

616
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,240
super

617
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,400
knowledgeable about risk rankings risk

618
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,120
ratings things like that when you use

619
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,760
this matrix what this does is it allows

620
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,159
you to help them prioritize so if it's

621
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,039
somebody that maybe has a lot of money

622
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,360
you could probably start high impact

623
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,159
high impact low effort and then move to

624
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,480
high impact high effort if it's somebody

625
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,240
who's just trying to get their program

626
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,080
you're going to start high impact high

627
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,000
effort and work your way around

628
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,799
so this is very easy you can find it at

629
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,880
a glance and it'll help you build a

630
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,400
roadmap so everybody better understands

631
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,799
what the risk is

632
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,840
excuse me one second

633
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,440
all right so

634
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,000
next is breaking things down monetarily

635
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,320
this is my least favorite approach but

636
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,400
it's one that's worth mentioning

637
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,360
so i had a chemicals client

638
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,039
and i did an itar assessment at a

639
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,559
chemicals client

640
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:09,440
and

641
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,679
they did an itar assessment because they

642
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:12,480
were

643
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,840
in the talks for having a government

644
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,280
contract

645
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,480
and when i walked through this beautiful

646
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,919
i think it was the longest report i ever

647
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,280
did was like 43 pages i walked through

648
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,919
43 pages with them and they're like we

649
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,200
don't care

650
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,480
because we got this contract and we have

651
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,960
to do it so just give me a number so i

652
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,320
was like okay you know your number is

653
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,480
two million dollars congratulations

654
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,600
but

655
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,919
when you lay things out monetarily make

656
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,320
sure that you're always also telling

657
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,760
them exactly what they're going to get

658
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,000
from that so you definitely need to make

659
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,799
sure

660
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,039
that it's presented with maybe the risk

661
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,440
of not implementing so hey if you don't

662
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,480
implement you're going to miss out on

663
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,080
this two million dollars worth of

664
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,200
contracts

665
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,000
or

666
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
hey like

667
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,400
um if you don't implement then

668
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,000
you know there's other clients out there

669
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,520
that are looking for this this framework

670
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,559
assessment things like that

671
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,039
you're gonna make sure that they know

672
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,240
what they're missing if you're

673
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,360
presenting

674
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:17,080
monetarily first

675
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,000
all right

676
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,039
so

677
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,360
make tips on making recommendations the

678
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,360
do's and don'ts

679
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,559
i'm going to start over here with the

680
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:27,679
do's

681
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,679
i think these automation and tool reuse

682
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,039
is something that everybody is probably

683
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,440
familiar with whenever you're making

684
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,039
sure that you're using tools that

685
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,960
clients already have they're going to be

686
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,320
more likely to work with you because

687
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,320
they don't have to spend as much money

688
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,679
and i think it's going to be easier for

689
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:42,880
you because they already know these

690
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,720
tools and you don't have to do a lot of

691
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,880
training and automation is something

692
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,320
that speaks to everybody in this room

693
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,440
i'm sure

694
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,360
making sure that

695
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,400
you know less hands-on work

696
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,159
the big one in here is adjusting

697
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,840
recommendations while still maintaining

698
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,240
integrity

699
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,000
so let's say a client says they don't

700
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,159
have money to invest in a huge risk that

701
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:05,360
they have

702
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,039
what i would recommend is making sure

703
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,720
that you're breaking it down into

704
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,799
smaller more manageable pieces

705
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,720
because what might happen

706
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,600
is

707
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,559
they if you seem to reduce the risk

708
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,799
they might think oh this risk isn't as

709
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,400
big of a deal is because you know we

710
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,080
can't afford it so we need to like rush

711
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,000
over it you need to maintain the

712
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,400
integrity of the risk

713
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,679
you need to make sure that you're still

714
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,679
communicating that it's important even

715
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,520
though they can't afford it or you have

716
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,520
to find worse ways to work around that

717
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,919
and the don'ts

718
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,760
so do not exaggerate risk

719
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,080
what i mean by this is as a consultant

720
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,000
they're coming to you and trusting you

721
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,640
because they really care well excuse me

722
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,000
they're coming in and trust you because

723
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,240
they really think that you're the expert

724
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,120
i'm gonna use zero trust as an example i

725
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,720
really think that xero trust is just a

726
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,120
way for consultants to sell more work

727
00:25:59,120 --> 00:25:59,919
and

728
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,679
because you know you're saying oh like

729
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,120
you need to lock everything down lock

730
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,880
everything down that's not true

731
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,640
i mean maybe it is in in certain

732
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,440
scenarios but with xero trust you're

733
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,520
just selling selling more and making

734
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,200
those recommendations when maybe they

735
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,520
don't need it so making sure that you

736
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,360
maintain integrity when you're

737
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,520
discussing risk and only doing what's

738
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,279
necessary is extremely important

739
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,520
next is back channeling i know we talked

740
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,640
about earlier in the presentation that

741
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,320
with back channeling you know you should

742
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,320
be telling them things don't be

743
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,480
inconsistent i think when i say back

744
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,400
channeling that's the problem if you say

745
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,640
something's a big deal but then on your

746
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,000
presentation you say it's not that makes

747
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
you lose trust in your client like that

748
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,919
makes the client relationship lose trust

749
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,200
and they might not want to work with you

750
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,200
in the future

751
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,000
and then finally be realistic don't over

752
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,679
or undersell effort

753
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,840
if another consulting firm is saying

754
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,120
that it's going to take six months and

755
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,320
you say that it's going to take two

756
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,240
months they're going to be like why why

757
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,679
are these people saying it's going to

758
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:02,880
take six months when you say it's going

759
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,400
to take two months are you not doing

760
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,279
your job or you know are you

761
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,039
doing something really fast where these

762
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,000
people might only be you know

763
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,760
be dragging it out for more money things

764
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,520
like that so making sure that you're

765
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,760
accurately assessing things

766
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,240
is really important for not only you but

767
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,919
to manage your clients expectations

768
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,640
all right so

769
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,200
congratulations we won the

770
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,000
implementation

771
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,840
let's deliver for our clients

772
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,960
all right so independence and integrity

773
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,240
um you are the security expert

774
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,240
and they're coming to you you have to

775
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,320
protect their data

776
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,919
as security consultants we may have

777
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:49,600
access to things like insider trading

778
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,799
information

779
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,840
um i worked at a large beverage company

780
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,440
that extremely protects their secret

781
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,440
um what is that there's their recipe in

782
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,399
a vault

783
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,880
yeah their secret sauce spongebob excuse

784
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,600
me

785
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,360
um

786
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,799
so we worked at a large beverage company

787
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:09,600
that protects their recipe in a vault

788
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,600
and i was digging through their sandbox

789
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,640
when i was still an sap consultant and i

790
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,279
found a bill of materials for uh a

791
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,200
recipe for their

792
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,000
thing

793
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,679
and i was like

794
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,039
you know my heart stopped because i'd

795
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,240
seen it in this vault in the you know

796
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,039
in down in atlanta and i went and um

797
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,120
i told someone i was like hey you guys

798
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,559
have a bill of materials here like this

799
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,640
is your recipe and you really protect

800
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,440
this

801
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,039
i said something because i didn't want

802
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,720
anybody else to find this you know when

803
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,399
i was just digging around in a sandbox

804
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,080
they're like no no it's sanitized you're

805
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,000
fine you know that we sanitized the data

806
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,279
when we brought it down from prod i was

807
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,720
like oh thank god i don't think i could

808
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,279
have resisted looking you know

809
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:52,799
but that's what i mean by maintaining

810
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,120
integrity if something seems wrong or

811
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,039
something seems like it's off it's your

812
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,399
job to do something about it

813
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,360
so let's walk through some scenarios

814
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,279
so these are ethics questions kind of so

815
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,279
this is your ethics exam

816
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,000
in the context of security consulting

817
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,880
so

818
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,960
your client asks you to change technical

819
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,279
configurations that do not coincide with

820
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,279
best practice

821
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,279
how do you approach it

822
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:27,720
does anybody want to try to take a guess

823
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,200
yeah slap them upside the head

824
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,080
anybody yes

825
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,360
yes that is a great but they still say

826
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,880
no

827
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,640
yes

828
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,919
yes

829
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,200
yes

830
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,799
sorry he said explain the risk he said

831
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,000
try to bring them towards beck's

832
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,840
practice do you have another one

833
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,279
yeah

834
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:53,360
yes

835
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,679
yes those are all great things and those

836
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,120
are all the steps that we were going to

837
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,080
walk through good job everyone so first

838
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,240
is why they might have a good reason

839
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,840
could be you know they need to let

840
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,159
somebody in something like that

841
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,480
yeah

842
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:11,360
so first is to discuss the risk

843
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,919
you should be documenting as you go

844
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,600
let's say they still decide that they

845
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,320
don't want to do it

846
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,960
document document document

847
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,200
if something goes wrong you might be

848
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,520
responsible for that so as a trusted

849
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,720
advisor you want to make sure that that

850
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,559
does not come back on you and it was

851
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,799
their decision opening a risk acceptance

852
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,120
form is one of the examples that you

853
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,320
could take

854
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,679
but making sure that everything is

855
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,200
written down so that doesn't fall back

856
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,880
on you is extremely important

857
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,480
all right scenario two an individual

858
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,000
your client says they're moving changes

859
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,279
through proper change management

860
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,679
channels they say that they are

861
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,360
but you check the audit logs and find

862
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,480
that they have been moving changes

863
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,240
without approval

864
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,880
what do you do

865
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,399
jewels anything

866
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,720
yes yes making sure that it doesn't come

867
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,399
back on you is extremely important she

868
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,000
said get a copy of the audit logs make

869
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,559
sure they don't come back on you

870
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:18,519
anybody else yes

871
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,559
that's a great one

872
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,880
so he says go to the proper channels he

873
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,399
says talk to them and see if maybe the

874
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,720
process is too complicated those are all

875
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,559
great examples

876
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:40,879
um

877
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,000
so i think what what i would do if i was

878
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,159
in this situation is first discuss it

879
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:49,039
with the individual see exactly why

880
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:50,640
they might not know that they're doing

881
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,760
it wrong

882
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,360
and educating them would be a great

883
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,640
first step

884
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,799
if they still continue to do it it's

885
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,799
your job to raise it as a red flag

886
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,279
escalate make sure that you know they

887
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:03,440
are finding that

888
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,960
you know that you're taking them through

889
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,840
the correct path

890
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,279
it's your job to be that advisor so

891
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,120
making sure that you tell them

892
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,039
exactly what they're doing wrong or

893
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,240
making sure you're telling the client

894
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,519
exactly what they're doing wrong because

895
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,440
if they know that you saw it it might

896
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,120
come back on you and you definitely

897
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,678
don't want that

898
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,480
all right

899
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,840
job everyone

900
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,360
um so great we continually sold work and

901
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,000
we all buy bmws and we live happily ever

902
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,200
after so

903
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,960
thank you all for being in my consulting

904
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,960
firm

905
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,799
so discussing key takeaways risk is not

906
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,799
arbitrary making sure you pick your

907
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,480
favorite framework

908
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,440
level setting who you're talking to

909
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,159
um making risk easy to consume for all

910
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,559
parties so making sure everybody knows

911
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,000
exactly what you're talking about and

912
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,159
they they understand

913
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:08,080
maintaining integrity and then finally

914
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,559
don't write hip on your resume this i

915
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,000
didn't talk about this but i think this

916
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,519
one's really important to hit on uh

917
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,519
because i'm sure that this happens all

918
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,840
the time

919
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,399
huh

920
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:21,919
uh he says he throws them away and

921
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,399
that's coming from a security consulting

922
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,879
ceo

923
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:31,360
all right so anybody have any questions

924
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,720
yes

925
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,840
so from a security from a security

926
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,480
consulting perspective um if you make a

927
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,880
mistake you're going to get fired um i

928
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,320
mean it's it's just like that they're

929
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,720
paying you to be there uh there's

930
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,320
mistakes do happen um and i think that

931
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,359
there's a certain threshold of trust and

932
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,679
integrity that you know people can

933
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,719
understand but if you're consistently

934
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,440
messing up if you're consistently

935
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,520
having problems then your client can

936
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,040
just simply choose not to work with you

937
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,199
anymore so i think those are some of the

938
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,280
ramifications when you work for like a

939
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,520
big four like i did before sometimes

940
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,960
that person would be kicked off the

941
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,719
project

942
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,480
and they could continue their project

943
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,599
you know because those are typically

944
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,280
millions of dollars

945
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,719
so those are some of the ramifications

946
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,760
that i've seen

947
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,599
thanks for the question

948
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,639
anybody else yes

949
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,720
so i only heard the first part of the

950
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,520
question so what are some of the challen

951
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,040
what are the challenges that i've seen

952
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,800
that don't align to best practice

953
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,359
it's not the same with each client so

954
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:14,960
what are some of the

955
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,520
challenges you face as a consultant even

956
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,760
with all your experiences

957
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,240
that you're still trying to overcome

958
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,440
um i think right now is employment

959
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,079
a lot of our clients have uh there's not

960
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,560
enough people to support i think that's

961
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,160
been you know i've been a consultant i

962
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,960
think going on six years now so

963
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,440
i a lot of there's not enough shoes to

964
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,440
fill the roles that they have and work

965
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,359
does not get done on a fast enough

966
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:43,280
timeline and when work is not getting

967
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,800
done on a fast enough timeline that

968
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,320
pushes you back

969
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,200
so

970
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,000
um

971
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,160
i think that's one of the big challenges

972
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,720
another one is to

973
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,160
with people

974
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,119
um

975
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,400
a lot of the time like when i'm talking

976
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,760
about security style like i've been

977
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,359
working with people who had been in

978
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:01,680
their jobs for like 40 years and they

979
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,520
don't want to be told that what they're

980
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,599
doing is wrong

981
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:06,320
so

982
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,920
making sure that you're really

983
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,359
developing a good

984
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:13,839
working relationship with that person is

985
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,720
very very important because then they

986
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,480
might be able to

987
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,359
you know move

988
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,760
make changes and adapt appropriately

989
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,560
thank you for the question

990
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,280
all right

991
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,480
oh money money is a big problem too

992
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,040
nobody has money

993
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,520
any other questions

994
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,359
