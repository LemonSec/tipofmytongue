1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,560
all right

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,720
without further ado

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:10,160
lies more lies and ransomware statistics

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,599
okay i turned the mic on oh i can hear

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,200
myself great okay

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,799
so let's uh let's uh

7
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,320
so you can do so my name is dennis i'm

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,480
an engineer uh so um

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,439
uh yeah so what i'm gonna do is i'm

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,920
gonna walk you guys through some of uh

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,400
the business decisions uh that we make

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,240
internally for our own company for our

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,279
products

14
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:32,719
and what to do and what the charge

15
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,800
things like that and also

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,680
some of the number crunching that we try

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,640
to

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,920
give our clients

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,680
from an advisory sense

20
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,079
because actually this is one of the most

21
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,719
difficult challenges i've had uh so far

22
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,160
in my career is to provide some kind of

23
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,120
quantification that i can defend on

24
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,800
who's gonna hit with randomware what's

25
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,480
the probability and what's the impact

26
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,320
right the numbers are all over the place

27
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,079
just to warn you we're not going to boil

28
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,520
the ocean here but i'm going to walk you

29
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,559
through some stuff that we're doing

30
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,079
internally and some of the challenges

31
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,000
that i had and when at one point i had

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,400
to walk away because i got too angry so

33
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,960
we'll definitely cover that one

34
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,439
so first of all um i noticed a large

35
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,520
technical crowd here right so some of

36
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,040
you of course know exactly what this

37
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,759
slide is all about some of you uh maybe

38
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,119
you've never seen it before and that's

39
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,520
cool either way right so um we're

40
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,040
talking about the probability the impact

41
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,360
of risk and it's a good diagram to show

42
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,920
so what we're going to say is you know

43
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,000
what is the probability and what is the

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,280
impact the death to the business right

45
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,320
for a ransomware attack it sounds super

46
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,560
easy right to maybe pick one and go with

47
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,560
it

48
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,159
the challenge is that you know when

49
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,520
you're looking okay what do i want to do

50
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,399
what can i do to actually

51
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,759
maybe uh

52
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:50,960
figure out what needs to be done for

53
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,479
ransomware right

54
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,079
one of the biggest things that i see and

55
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,840
of course what's that saying you know if

56
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,159
you buy ibm those are getting fired like

57
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,840
just buy what the neighbors are buying

58
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,439
kind of thing well what's happening with

59
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,759
ransomware is really really interesting

60
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:04,880
to me

61
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,799
there's enough data out there i call it

62
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,280
enough fail on the defender side that we

63
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,639
actually have some really good metrics

64
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,520
right and one of them is that oh it's

65
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,360
like i have to face forward like a

66
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,920
proper speaker so one of the challenges

67
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,760
is that

68
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,920
people are buying like next gen endpoint

69
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,920
security products right as part of the

70
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,080
suite of things that they're buying to

71
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,560
try to keep up and combat ransomware

72
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,000
because when the boss is asking what are

73
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,519
you doing about ransomware you better

74
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,200
have an answer hopefully it's a good

75
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,200
answer but you have to have an answer

76
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,680
right around 61 of people are out there

77
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,680
actually buying endpoint uh security

78
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,760
products right edrs well if you notice

79
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,760
here the if you take some market survey

80
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,800
results

81
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,360
edr's like next gen endpoint products

82
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,400
really only have around 36 percent

83
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,560
of market penetration right so there's

84
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,480
not a ton of people out there buying the

85
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,840
stuff that probably a lot of the people

86
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,560
here have in their businesses right of

87
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,480
that group if you look at the numbers

88
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,800
over three-fourths of the victims of

89
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,120
ransomware have those tools so what's

90
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,200
going on is that the ransomware people

91
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,040
perversely are attacking the folks who

92
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,440
have security budgets right who have the

93
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,360
money to go after you right they're not

94
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,280
going after the uh you know the

95
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,959
penniless non-profit that has no

96
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,400
security product and has

97
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,120
uh

98
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,239
i don't want to name any names they

99
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,000
don't feel bad but like free antivirus

100
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,599
you know they're not going after those

101
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,200
folks they're going after the folks who

102
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,200
are spending money on backups and point

103
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,120
security and it's not because folks like

104
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,040
you aren't trying to do something right

105
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,120
and they did a survey i think it was so

106
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,680
folks did it it was 91 companies said

107
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,799
they want to do something or they

108
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,400
already had something right to try to

109
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,000
combat ransomware so it's definitely

110
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,440
something that we're all concerned about

111
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,519
um unfortunately the attackers uh are

112
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,120
going after the ones that are concerned

113
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,799
right so

114
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:47,840
let's first start with the risk

115
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,840
management exercise let's say okay we

116
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,440
need to prepare to ask for budget like

117
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,519
you want to go buy a tool right so

118
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,680
what's step one for any project

119
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,640
find a scapegoat right for when it fails

120
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,159
but really you need you to find some

121
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,400
kind of third party data source to say

122
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,640
look this is the probability and this is

123
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,799
the impact for the ransomware attack

124
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:07,840
right this is the risk management

125
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,920
exercise we've got to do when preparing

126
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,200
for budgets

127
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,760
make sure you defend your math right if

128
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,599
there's the board members who love

129
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,839
numbers maybe it's a cfo on the board

130
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,000
there should be one probably right um

131
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,519
then you need to make sure that they

132
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,280
don't have numbers that are wildly

133
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,360
different than yours so you're not stuck

134
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,280
with this battle of the facts you know

135
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,400
trying to figure out what the right

136
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,240
facts are we'll get into that i've

137
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,840
actually never seen an environment like

138
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,800
this before where the numbers for risk

139
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,400
management are so wildly off uh that it

140
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,639
actually causes some major problems in

141
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,960
deciding risk spend

142
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,160
of course i know everyone is the

143
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,120
organization everyone all the attendees

144
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,560
your you know your board meetings are

145
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,400
very nice you all decide numbers

146
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,880
logically and you move forward right

147
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,479
maybe

148
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,160
no one laughs so that was my one joke

149
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,479
yeah okay so let's get back to uh back

150
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,280
to business okay so if you get it wrong

151
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,120
we have enough fail again or enough win

152
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,800
on the good guys side that we actually

153
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,320
get to see the effects of getting it

154
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,880
wrong right you just um we'll say that

155
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,240
like someone just says i'm going to go

156
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,320
buy an edr and we're going to call quits

157
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,720
right that's been my solution and just

158
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,800
like you know data breaches

159
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,360
there can be stolen data right um the

160
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,759
business still is able to earn revenue

161
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,000
right it's not a business continuity

162
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,759
issue in many cases right with

163
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,000
ransomware you have this whole extra

164
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,960
element where it's not like you know um

165
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,720
you know you lost data and then everyone

166
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,880
argues about reputational costs and you

167
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,639
know uh regulatory costs and things like

168
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,479
that and it's all cost doing business

169
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,000
in this case you have major impact like

170
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,639
the cfo has line items for the kind of

171
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,039
impact here for ransomware right

172
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,120
whenever the business stops operating

173
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,600
with revenue at that point honestly if

174
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,120
you look at the numbers and then pull up

175
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,560
fema reports it's very similar to a

176
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,880
major fire in like a restaurant it's a

177
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,120
very very similar track and to how long

178
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,639
your business has before it's gone

179
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,880
forever which is a very scary place to

180
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,360
be right um so

181
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,560
one thing that i really want to point

182
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,400
out here is that even when you pay the

183
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,080
ransom and survive

184
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,840
61 of the time

185
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,080
your organization has lost the data

186
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,120
forever

187
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,120
now a little war story here i get a

188
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,280
phone call last week from someone there

189
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,800
you know who uh they got hit with

190
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,720
ransomware was the manufacturing uh

191
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,120
plant and um they gave us a call back

192
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,080
and said they're taking care of the

193
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,080
problem themselves they don't need our

194
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,960
decrypters or anything um i asked oh do

195
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,039
tell do you need help whatever you know

196
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,319
well it turns out they said no we're

197
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,560
deleting all the hacker files

198
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,840
they were going through all their

199
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,919
servers and deleting all the encrypted

200
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,479
files their files right and they said

201
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,360
they were almost done and i don't know

202
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,479
if they're ever going to call again

203
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:49,919
because at that point their business is

204
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,440
gone right so like um but regardless so

205
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,560
64

206
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,840
loose data

207
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,560
82 percent lose business critical data

208
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,080
and what that means is the old game of

209
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,840
backups right where

210
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,440
the hackers maybe got the most recent

211
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,520
backups but the ones in the tape drives

212
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,360
back inside the mountain are you know

213
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,160
pretty safe right and so you now have 23

214
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,160
copies of 2011 tax returns to your

215
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,400
business but you don't have the rfps

216
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,800
that were due next week right and so

217
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,199
what's happening is that 82 percent

218
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,840
actually of that 61 is kind of weird but

219
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,599
they've lost business critical data it's

220
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,759
not just like hey i lost my photos that

221
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,919
weren't really important it's i lost the

222
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,039
stuff that i need to service my

223
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,400
customers contractually i have

224
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,560
obligations i have sales

225
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,840
things going on

226
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,840
that data's gone forever even undoing

227
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,840
decryption it didn't quite work right

228
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,919
it's just it's known um are there any

229
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,520
msps or i.t providers in the audience

230
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,199
it's always like no no whatever he reads

231
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,080
there oh there's someone actually raised

232
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,199
their hand oh my goodness i'm sorry for

233
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,039
you on the spot you know so like um so

234
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,440
what happens is when uh if you're like

235
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,599
uh msp your messed source writer it

236
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,759
provider gets hit with ransomware or has

237
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,319
a customer that gets it with ransomware

238
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,000
if the other customers find out in 15 of

239
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,479
the time half the customers walk within

240
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,960
three days once they find out um

241
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,039
normally within 75 percent of the time

242
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,639
at least one customer

243
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,639
beyond the one that got ransomware walks

244
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,639
right so these are very very serious

245
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,720
issues even for the i.t providers right

246
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,120
because knowing it's almost like this uh

247
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,800
social stigma we're going to get this a

248
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,000
little bit more where no one wants to

249
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,599
talk about getting with ransomware but

250
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,360
it's happening enough that when it does

251
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,120
happen even though we're spending money

252
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,440
to try to stop it what happens is is

253
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,039
that you know people are losing business

254
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,559
they're losing their livelihoods things

255
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,399
like that

256
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,159
normally i stop here and ask questions

257
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,200
but

258
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,279
does not seem like people aren't like in

259
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,519
the mosh pit here like ready to ask

260
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,880
questions so

261
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,839
um

262
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:44,800
so

263
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,240
one another another technique you can

264
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,920
use i've seen this actually at play

265
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,160
before um

266
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,360
this was uh

267
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,480
if you guys ever heard of martha's

268
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,399
vineyard it's actually part of a larger

269
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,360
corporation it's it's a government body

270
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,720
so their

271
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,720
their operating revenues and their their

272
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,959
balance sheets are all kind of out there

273
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,320
for the public to read if you really

274
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,080
really really want to do it

275
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,680
and what happened was was that they had

276
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,680
spent a ton of money on backups and

277
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,399
other things to try to uh you know stay

278
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,320
in business to react and respond very

279
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,399
quickly to ransomware right there was an

280
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,080
old game i saw it being played i'm at

281
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,680
one point i was over at nsa you know

282
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,279
national security agency and there was a

283
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,320
game they played with government

284
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,839
contracts where if they knew they

285
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,360
weren't going to succeed or couldn't

286
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,839
succeed then they would redefine the

287
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,600
success metrics right they would kind of

288
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,760
scale back what success was so they

289
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,680
could all come back and be like we won

290
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,120
and it was like yeah but you only did

291
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,160
like half what you said you were going

292
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,399
to do in the beginning right so in this

293
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,160
case what i'm seeing is in some cases um

294
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,760
to to manage the risk and manage

295
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,640
reputational damage to the i.t team to

296
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,680
leadership

297
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,120
these quotes are actually from the

298
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,040
security leadership right i'm sure he's

299
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,120
a great guy i'm sure they tried really

300
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,320
hard right

301
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,640
ransomware happened they finally got

302
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,200
minimal services up after a week for

303
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,640
it's called the steamship authority or

304
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,399
something uh jim one of my guys was from

305
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,959
boston so he's all about it like but um

306
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,240
up in that area and what happened was

307
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,600
what they were up and running right

308
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,240
within a week well i pulled down the

309
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,079
balance sheets and i said what are we

310
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,240
talking about here in terms of the

311
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,240
revenue loss of the company for that one

312
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,480
week after they spent all that money on

313
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,240
backups they can come back within a week

314
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,240
right turns out they lost 3.6 million

315
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,240
dollars in sales lane revenue based on

316
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,560
projections you know for that period um

317
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,399
that put them in the red for the next 18

318
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,440
months

319
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,800
there's no coming back they're in the

320
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,040
red if they do everything right right

321
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,959
and so that's the table stakes here

322
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,120
really is that you know even when you

323
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,360
say oh we did it we're back within the

324
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,000
norm is actually like 12 days or or 15

325
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,279
days something like that to get minimal

326
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,160
services back um they did within a week

327
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,839
they still are in the red like the

328
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,399
business is no longer profitable uh just

329
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,040
on that one event

330
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,839
so

331
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,399
let's let's focus on ransoms that's like

332
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,920
if you're going to define the risk and

333
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,680
the cost of the business

334
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,440
there's a whole bunch of variables and

335
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,880
uh there's some really really smart

336
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,959
people that do all that discreet math

337
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,480
that we kind of slept through in college

338
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,240
right that have you know a thousand

339
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,760
variables to figure out the risk

340
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,360
exposure how much it's gonna cost to

341
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,120
business things like that let's start

342
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,800
with ransom i redacted the names of the

343
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,000
data sources on purpose because um

344
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,320
you know i you know i i didn't want to

345
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,600
name anyone i don't want that to be a

346
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,440
focus and maybe it's because the source

347
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,079
right these are three leading industry

348
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,160
standard sources that people like

349
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,200
previous presentations actually use in

350
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,360
their analysis on you know in their

351
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,600
advisory things like that the first one

352
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,800
showed um three years of ransoms right

353
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,360
and we have forty three hundred dollars

354
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,440
fifty nine hundred dollars and eighty

355
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,000
one hundred dollars that is not a typo

356
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,480
right what is a typo exact in that faith

357
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,240
like that's the face i made it was like

358
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,079
this can't be real you know what

359
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,839
happened was was you dig into their math

360
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,519
this was a major publication by

361
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,519
international company what happened was

362
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,720
was that

363
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,040
they forgot to put in a zero in one of

364
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,519
their calculations and that it went

365
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,760
straight through to publishing people

366
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,000
layered on their analysis and their math

367
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,760
and then you can actually google around

368
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,000
it's still out there being repeated

369
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,240
what happened was was that those numbers

370
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,200
were then used by other publications

371
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,079
because it's now like trusted source and

372
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,560
three or four layers down you actually i

373
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,240
found an article where someone was

374
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,320
advising on how much insurance to buy

375
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,760
for their company based on the 8 100

376
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,480
ransom right which everyone in this room

377
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,000
should say that sounds kind of low right

378
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,880
um but these are you know uh desktop

379
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,160
publishing people they don't know the

380
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,519
numbers like we do right um we have data

381
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,680
source two right which had eighty four

382
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,279
thousand dollars which is probably more

383
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,519
reasonable maybe it's not newsworthy

384
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,440
right i mean that's sad to say but you

385
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,519
know with the losses it's not the the

386
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,160
five million dollar ransoms right um

387
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,320
it's a respectable number we have data

388
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,200
source three again a very very reputable

389
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,480
source

390
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,160
they have some inside knowledge into

391
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,839
some of the insurance payouts actually

392
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,519
so from cyber insurance and they're

393
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,519
coming with numbers for average and

394
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,839
median now um

395
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,079
i know we uh kyle previously get a whole

396
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,920
bunch of like mathy things with bits and

397
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,360
bytes and everything right we're not

398
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,120
going to go that deep but

399
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,399
if you look up the difference in average

400
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,800
and median so what happens is is that

401
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,240
basically there's a whole bunch of

402
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,440
lower cost ransoms that are

403
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,800
being accounted for and we're going to

404
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,959
talk about that in a second so what that

405
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,600
means is that there may be larger ransom

406
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,920
sums but what's happening is it's called

407
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,480
a um

408
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,079
hey it's not showing i'd like to throw a

409
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,360
graph there to show it but like

410
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,639
basically there's if you look at the

411
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,880
graph right then

412
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,040
i'm really bad about standing in my spot

413
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,880
so if there's a graph right here it

414
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,800
would show there's a whole bunch near

415
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,600
the

416
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,160
vertical axis right and it kind of tails

417
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:58,959
off

418
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,639
and when that happens

419
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,880
that's the number you get on data source

420
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,480
three right so that means they're

421
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,160
they're having access to a whole bunch

422
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,399
of data that show low like it's like a

423
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,920
volume game low number or low

424
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,160
money value high volume a whole bunch of

425
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,639
transactions at lower numbers right

426
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,399
i'm gonna call that a lie in a second

427
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,240
right

428
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,120
so look at the raw data this is from

429
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:23,920
where

430
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,079
the good guys beat the hackers they only

431
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,360
got 1.8 billion dollars and they gave up

432
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,000
we got them right so they retired

433
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,040
because they got out they're probably

434
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,959
back in our group now right but we got

435
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,240
some awesome awesome raw data off of

436
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,320
their winnings basically right rather

437
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,880
fitting word a casino right so um

438
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,440
there were about 3 000 victims that they

439
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,279
released keys for

440
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,160
um

441
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,680
i'm not going to ask any feds in here

442
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,920
this isn't this isn't uh you know defcon

443
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,000
but like um

444
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,920
there were 88 victims that law

445
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,600
enforcement was tracking at the moment

446
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,959
right that they knew about that were

447
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,760
reported right if you do the math

448
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,680
that means that of all of our risk

449
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,839
analysis we're all doing for our boards

450
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,079
and our companies and our managers we

451
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:11,199
have three percent visibility into

452
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,279
what's really going on that means that

453
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,560
companies are getting hit and they're

454
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,800
not reporting the average ransom in the

455
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,880
data from avadon from those folks is a

456
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,480
really cool z net report there's other

457
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,600
ones out there

458
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,480
was that the ransom was actually 600 000

459
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,600
so

460
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,199
we go back

461
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,120
is is that anywhere close we're seeing

462
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:29,920
here

463
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,079
not at all right so companies are

464
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,360
getting bled

465
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,839
right they're trying to fix the problem

466
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,839
it's almost like a social stigma like i

467
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,600
don't know like vd or something like you

468
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,360
can't talk about it ever you know like

469
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,759
in normal society right and so that's

470
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,519
what we're seeing here right this is not

471
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,000
a good situation for us as the i.t

472
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,240
security and the business leaders to try

473
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,399
to mitigate risk imagine if the fire

474
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,399
departments had that kind of like

475
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,399
shortage of data right there would be

476
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,079
major major problems with the city

477
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,880
blocks burning down

478
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,759
so

479
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,079
possible biases we have here um i'm

480
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,600
probably dating myself a little bit with

481
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,199
that screenshot so so we have um

482
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,519
an issue where

483
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,279
we do have missing data sometimes it's

484
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,680
not always that egregious but i do find

485
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,079
that there are mistakes in the math i'm

486
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,560
assuming it's because um there's just so

487
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,199
much strange data out there that people

488
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,639
are trying to put together myself

489
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,000
included where i'm like it towards the

490
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,600
end i'm going to say this is my gut says

491
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,959
because we have to do at some point you

492
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,000
know because there's just not enough

493
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,480
good data out there on this so

494
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,360
um

495
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,560
the

496
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,160
the crime with the missing zero really

497
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,800
was that there there's only so much data

498
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,800
that is out there right and we have to

499
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,320
trust it because we don't know what to

500
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,639
trust right and so the real crime here

501
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,440
is that that data is fueling the exact

502
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,440
same people that are doing analysis at

503
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,240
your insurance company right at law

504
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,519
enforcement at other places to fuel

505
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,440
pricing for products like what we're

506
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,600
doing right to fuel okay

507
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,680
what's really the cost to the business

508
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,319
what is the business impact right um the

509
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,480
probability we know we already know now

510
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,160
we only have three percent visibility

511
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,559
right but in terms of the uh the cost

512
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,480
right um

513
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,160
we really need to watch

514
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,039
um

515
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,799
what we feel might be wrong i mean i

516
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,000
don't have a better answer for you than

517
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
that right um but i'm trying to figure

518
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,919
out when we go through the analysis is

519
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,599
kind of like what feels right which

520
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,760
doesn't feel right what can i latch on

521
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,039
to that's good there's actually a

522
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,079
government report that came out i'll get

523
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,679
to in a second that helps out a lot with

524
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,360
that we'll go into that i'm very happy

525
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,160
about it the uh the second possible bias

526
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,080
is the victim profile so first of all

527
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,799
the ransoms for like small indian

528
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,799
companies um are much much lower like

529
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,640
three to five thousand dollars really

530
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,240
right um and what's interesting is that

531
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,960
different verticals have different uh

532
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,440
ransoms of which the market can bear

533
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,960
right so med tech can afford to pay a

534
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,960
lot more ransom and to keep it quiet

535
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,480
before the fda testing right than say a

536
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,160
mom and pop butcher right it's just the

537
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,760
way it works right for every industry

538
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,600
ever um so what's happening is that

539
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,679
depending on who is willing to speak up

540
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,919
we'll get to this in a second um

541
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,640
uh depends on it it heavily skews the

542
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,000
ransom now if uh if 10 000 small

543
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,480
companies in india in pakistan all

544
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,480
report that they go with ransomware

545
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,280
right but then the uh

546
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,880
the companies in the united states that

547
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,799
have reached council on the phone and

548
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,640
some strange security company person

549
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,919
asked them hey have you gotten

550
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,679
ransomware can you tell us to ransom how

551
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,120
much it cost your company that week

552
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,520
please don't tell shareholders right um

553
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,600
you're not gonna answer right and so

554
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,840
that is actually one of the biases i'm

555
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,160
seeing is that folks that don't have the

556
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,160
lawyer a culture the mature kind of like

557
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,440
breach response culture like we have

558
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,240
here in america tend to answer up more

559
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,039
um and that i want to say pollutes the

560
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,039
metrics but it definitely has a very

561
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,360
meaningful effect that we already saw

562
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,440
with the the graph that i had to

563
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,400
pantomime you know um so uh the second

564
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,919
thing we see is that i call it the

565
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,640
goldilocks for ransomware like so what i

566
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,960
see is that we saw some african clinics

567
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,600
got hit right and they had computers of

568
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,880
course this isn't like you know they run

569
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,200
the dark ages but they also still had a

570
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,880
ton of paper because they didn't quite

571
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,559
trust the computer stuff

572
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,000
for power reasons or whatever i mean

573
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,360
this is like u.n right so it's not like

574
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,039
they're living in the dark ages right um

575
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,120
but they had all the paper records so

576
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,600
they went down from ransomware it it

577
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,039
stunk for them you know they weren't

578
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,559
super super happy they had to have it

579
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:35,840
fixed but

580
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,360
they went right back to the paper

581
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,919
records right and then so it didn't

582
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,080
really have the impact for them like it

583
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,400
would if it like upmc or whatever and

584
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,919
you're all digital now right so um

585
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,600
the second point for the goldilocks you

586
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,960
know method is that um

587
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,240
the the super super big and um you know

588
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,559
very technical people at these very

589
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,360
large fortune 50 companies um they

590
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,120
require a different style of attack to

591
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,640
actually have meaningful impact right a

592
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,799
small attack on a branch in a big bank

593
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,000
uh you know big international

594
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,360
conglomerate isn't going to have the

595
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,120
same impact right you have a different

596
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,600
style of laying low spreading out going

597
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,200
through it could be six months or a year

598
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,720
before you actually hit them with the

599
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,559
ransomware right and take out enough

600
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,880
data to really put the pain on them

601
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,280
right that's not going to be like a a

602
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,520
ransomware as a service kind of like a

603
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,760
script kitty just running through right

604
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,840
um what i find is the are the most

605
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,919
vulnerable actually are folks that have

606
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,000
some good tech in place they have like

607
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,400
maybe office his 65 set up and they have

608
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,760
sharepoint they have all these cool

609
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,919
things going on and backups right

610
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,559
they are dependent on the technology but

611
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,200
they're not so mature and big that they

612
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,039
don't have like seven hot sites set

613
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,960
across the united states right like

614
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,000
that's that's not what we're talking

615
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,640
about here so um we find is that the

616
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,400
folks who are have to have successful

617
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,200
businesses um have good technology have

618
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,120
edrs and antivirus and all the cool

619
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,440
things right and firewalls are the ones

620
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,840
that actually hurt the most for

621
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,600
ransomware attacks because i mean we

622
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,120
already saw a little chart right they're

623
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,720
going after folks who have budget for

624
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,480
security right they're bypassing in

625
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,919
various ways which that's not this

626
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,559
presentation right but um we're seeing

627
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,280
that that that really helps um

628
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,039
define kind of like your risk we don't

629
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,960
have good numbers right but we can say

630
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,760
look

631
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,600
we're not i mean bank of america i don't

632
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,000
know yeah but but we are we are a

633
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,760
company that is technology driven

634
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,240
independent and email driven right then

635
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,760
we know that okay the ransomware

636
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,080
probably hit us hard you know um and the

637
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,480
ransomware vector uh so i love using

638
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,080
this example because

639
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,280
uh there was a data source that uh had a

640
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,679
whole lot of reporting on the stopped

641
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,720
ransomware variant the family right and

642
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,640
um unfortunately stockbrain somewhere

643
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,200
their big claim to fame was actually

644
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,960
file share like pirated software and

645
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,960
pirated movies and stuff that was their

646
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,520
major major uh vector for spreading

647
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,720
right well the bias there was that um

648
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,799
stop ransomware the individuals who are

649
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,960
downloading pirated copies of office

650
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,480
are not the big game hunters right

651
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,919
they're not the people who can afford to

652
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,240
pay big ransoms and so this one

653
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,400
reporting that came out um once they

654
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,400
realized it was all stop ransomware i

655
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,760
was like no wonder the numbers are so

656
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,919
low it's all like college kids you know

657
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,159
and people who are like pirating sex the

658
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,000
city episodes you know they're not gonna

659
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,159
like pay a lot of money in ransoms right

660
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,280
and so the data sources of where the

661
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,080
security companies are getting their uh

662
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,440
their metrics

663
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,760
heavily heavily effect is affected by

664
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,080
the ransomware that they're exposed to

665
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,240
does that all make sense

666
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,919
like no one's like walking out in droves

667
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,200
i guess

668
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,360
it's all good paid by they are okay so

669
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,039
um so

670
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,280
also who is the one to talk right i kind

671
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,200
of went back to this a little bit so the

672
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,000
large ransomware data sets for reporting

673
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,320
um it seems to be very survey driven

674
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,799
it's down to who does not have a lawyer

675
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,720
who says shut your mouth right

676
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,960
rightfully so probably right um

677
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,520
you know it's smaller organizations it's

678
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,360
i've noticed also it can be cultures

679
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,520
that are more open um and more

680
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,559
collaborative

681
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,120
uh than ones who are less collaborative

682
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,280
right that seems to also follow a trend

683
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,600
from like a society standpoint right or

684
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,960
organizations that are more

685
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,360
collaborative or industries right um so

686
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,360
what happens is that that shapes it's a

687
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,039
big enough problem three percent we only

688
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,960
know about three percent of it right um

689
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,640
it's a big enough problem that that

690
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,440
dramatically influences um you know the

691
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,360
data you have in front of you uh for

692
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,200
smaller ransomware data sets what i'm

693
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,120
seeing is there um there's companies

694
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,200
that specialize in uh incident response

695
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,320
right dfir right and um

696
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,320
they normally have a limited set of

697
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,440
customers right that have ransomware

698
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,200
there's like what 3 500 security

699
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,799
companies all servicing folks in the

700
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,279
united states alone right so um they

701
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,760
have a very limited view of maybe a few

702
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,960
hundred people you know that we're

703
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,960
victims right and they're basing all

704
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,360
their metrics off of that which is a

705
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,440
dangerous place to be any medical study

706
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,919
that has 300 people only you know that's

707
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:05,600
not a that's not a good medical study to

708
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,200
rely you know put your life on the line

709
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,640
for right you want thousands and

710
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,360
thousands of people right so

711
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,039
we also see that you know sometimes

712
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,640
there's man data disclosures now that

713
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,840
could be because of like government

714
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,080
regulation that could be contractually

715
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,559
right that could be where you're an i.t

716
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,720
provider and your customers talk to each

717
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,000
other or they're down the street from

718
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,720
each other and all of a sudden the

719
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,960
restaurant's closed right so there are

720
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,640
living disclosures that you know can

721
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,080
happen um

722
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,480
sometimes you you really don't trust

723
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,720
your nda because the employees figure

724
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,400
out what's going on right and next thing

725
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,919
you know they're on facebook and they're

726
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,919
talking right and that can cause serious

727
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,679
serious money but it does give some good

728
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,279
insight into what's going on right there

729
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,880
are certain ransomware incidents we

730
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,400
would never have known about hadn't it

731
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,559
been for people kind of leaked it out

732
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,279
right because of a actually a mandated

733
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:54,080
disclosure to a supplier

734
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,480
i am seeing where um public relations

735
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,080
attack mitigation strategies uh

736
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,880
minimization uh call your pr firm have

737
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,799
them kind of manage the communications

738
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,799
just like a breach right they got to be

739
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,720
fast right this is ransomware right your

740
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,520
business is going down possibly so

741
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,200
i do see that

742
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,760
that also seems to affect where there

743
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,360
could have been some good data

744
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,679
there's a very large consulting firm

745
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,520
that came back and they said okay we

746
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,080
went down from ransomware there was no

747
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,000
impact but we're back in business now a

748
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,159
week later you know and i was like okay

749
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,000
at least have some sense to it don't say

750
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,840
there was no impact when you're down

751
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,640
right um so we do see though where it

752
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,080
kind of hides the data from us as

753
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,080
security folks because we could have

754
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,600
gotten good data there right in terms of

755
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,039
like okay what did they do that worked

756
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,720
what did they do that didn't work

757
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,400
what was the probability they felt like

758
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,000
would they do right and wrong and that's

759
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,240
kind of would be good for us to have

760
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,880
right and unfortunately again we why

761
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,960
there's very good reasons why but they

762
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,440
uh we don't have access to that data um

763
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,840
and of course small companies normally

764
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,919
are much more open about

765
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,600
these ransomware attacks and things like

766
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,279
that they're by their nature more

767
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,440
community oriented normally and you know

768
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,440
they will disclose more again it goes

769
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,440
back to that that that graph that you

770
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,880
know i wish i'll find it um the um

771
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,000
where low ransoms for mom and pop shop a

772
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,760
gas station is not going to pay the same

773
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,200
amount as upmc right just common sense

774
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,240
right they don't have the budget to

775
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,720
so

776
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,200
those were the problems right i'm an

777
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,120
engineer right so who decided it was a

778
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,880
good idea to start a company right so

779
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,480
i'm sure my employees hate you saying

780
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,799
that but like um so uh what happened was

781
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,400
i said okay you know what

782
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,720
i'm a data scientist i'm an engineer i

783
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,960
can figure this out give me all the raw

784
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,279
data right so i poured through stuff and

785
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,279
i figured out where the best sources of

786
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,400
raw data were and i had this masterful

787
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,480
beautiful excel spreadsheet with like 80

788
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,320
variables in it and i said i'm going to

789
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,880
figure this out because i need to know

790
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,640
if i'm overcharging or under charging

791
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,159
for my ransomware prevention products

792
00:26:58,159 --> 00:26:59,919
i'm really selfish right you know to

793
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,279
figure out and i can convince people

794
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,720
that here's the probability here's the

795
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,240
impact i finally have the numbers the

796
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,200
juice is cooked right well so i started

797
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,480
doing that and i realized the third

798
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,240
world country issue was becoming a

799
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,120
problem right where the low paying

800
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,720
ransoms weren't as much and it was

801
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,799
polluting the data unless i'm talking to

802
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,960
them right like don't don't go to a

803
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,600
north american country i'm sorry company

804
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,360
and throw out a whole bunch of numbers

805
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,720
from third world right that's not going

806
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,440
to be a good lineup for anyone right so

807
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,520
what happened was was that um as i was

808
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,080
going through i got the data right it

809
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,840
was great it was in a an

810
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,720
excel spreadsheet um and then i realized

811
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,919
that like

812
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,760
the numbers kept coming out no matter

813
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,760
how i divided and added between the

814
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,679
cells and the columns and the rows it

815
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,640
was always 5.69 was the ratio for

816
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,320
everything and i was like let me put in

817
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,600
more companies or i'm sorry more

818
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,279
countries i put in canada i put in

819
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,440
switzerland i put in you know sweden and

820
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,200
great britain it was always

821
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,559
5.69 so

822
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,320
that's where i kind of like freaked out

823
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,159
a little bit not in a good way either

824
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,399
because i did all that work and i had

825
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,080
all the available data out there i think

826
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,320
i talked about it here more yeah and i

827
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,000
was like well it's all made up then

828
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,799
because there is no way the economies of

829
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,960
like every single first world country

830
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,679
have the same currency ratios and the

831
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,520
same market verticals and everything

832
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,679
right it had to have been all made up at

833
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,840
some point where i feel like some intern

834
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,120
was like i give up and they started

835
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,120
slapping in numbers and was like no

836
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,720
whatever guess this because i didn't see

837
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,880
it until the very end and it wasn't even

838
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,159
like a clean number it was like five

839
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,919
point six eight seven four nine six four

840
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,760
something like that right and i was like

841
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,080
no way that that number that specific

842
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,000
cost end up conditions right but would

843
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,039
ever have survived has all 80 variables

844
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,039
right for all the different countries

845
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,880
which means i went right back to square

846
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,720
one where i was like great now i've got

847
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,399
gut feelings and i got butterflies in

848
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,240
the air right but i do have three

849
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,240
percent exposure for what's that worse

850
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,000
you know so does that all make sense to

851
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,279
you guys why

852
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,360
like the numbers shouldn't be lining up

853
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,480
that cleanly across the global economies

854
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,159
okay cool

855
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:04,880
and

856
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,640
now you see why i took the names of the

857
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,880
reports off of here because i don't want

858
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,720
to like i don't want that to focus i

859
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,640
want the the problem with the numbers to

860
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,600
be the focus right

861
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,559
so

862
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:17,840
we're right back to here right i mean

863
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,039
right back to where i was right where i

864
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,200
was just like now what do i do right

865
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,799
because you're like well what's the

866
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,559
probability what's the impact

867
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,320
all i can tell you is that i'm right

868
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,960
back to gut feelings right and that

869
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,120
every survey out there is now suspect

870
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,240
right i'm looking over my shoulder no

871
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,279
matter what number i give

872
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:37,840
so

873
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,520
here comes the federal crimes

874
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,399
enforcement network fsan right um you

875
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,720
say you said fedsen maybe uh new report

876
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,120
came out i recommend you go find it and

877
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,240
you read it

878
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,480
one of the first things that they did it

879
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,039
was great um is they said

880
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,640
again i'm not part of the organization

881
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,240
right but i read that quote and i read

882
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,279
through it and i said the first thing

883
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,200
they they saw was we need more

884
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,279
visibility right we need something that

885
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:02,799
we can hang our hat on i mean it's a

886
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,559
it's a federal like crimes unfortunate

887
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,240
network they're very financially driven

888
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,240
right so of course the quants the

889
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,399
accountants the cfos the risk managers

890
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:13,200
they want to have numbers they can rely

891
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,760
on right just like we do right i got to

892
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,600
know how much to ask the boss for and i

893
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,399
got to go defend it right so great they

894
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,799
said hey in the fall 2020 just that was

895
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,960
just a little bit ago right they said we

896
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,640
want to have more

897
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,360
visibility into what's going on so

898
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,880
they started asking

899
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,440
ir companies to put stuff in now it was

900
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,799
kind of like a ask told right um without

901
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,240
a whole lot of teeth at this point quite

902
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,320
honestly um and what happens is you see

903
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,200
here

904
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,480
2020 they started to get a lot more data

905
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,480
in right now we're not we're not you

906
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,240
know beating that three percent yet but

907
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,080
we're doing a good job now right we have

908
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,679
better visibility in the numbers we can

909
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:55,440
rely on right from us-based ir firms

910
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,159
it's not global right it's u.s so it's

911
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,399
our market right and it's folks who have

912
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,399
gone ahead and gone to ir firms so

913
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:03,679
you're not going to get grandma trying

914
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,440
to get the grandkids photos back as much

915
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,360
right you're going to get companies like

916
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,320
ours that actually have needs to stay in

917
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,039
business right and what's great is that

918
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:14,640
you see here on

919
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,320
the 2021

920
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,320
we're starting to get velocity now right

921
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,360
because now we're starting to see what's

922
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,679
going on uh in a better way

923
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,279
with the disclosures

924
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,240
we have a higher number now in 2021 and

925
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,960
they only measure till june so now we

926
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,200
know okay we knew it was kind of bad we

927
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,039
didn't know how bad but now we see that

928
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:36,240
the velocity is well it was bad sort of

929
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,399
it's much worse now right we got that

930
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,120
right so if nothing else you could point

931
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,000
to the velocity um data driven right

932
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,399
from the u.s government showing you that

933
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,159
ransomware is more of a problem now for

934
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:51,120
organizations than it was before not not

935
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,799
blocked attacks or whatever these are

936
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,640
victims this is all ir this is all

937
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,360
ransoms being paid out from ir firms

938
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,200
that have agreed to collaborate with the

939
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,679
us government how am i in time anyway am

940
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,120
i

941
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,120
oh wow okay

942
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,120
so strategy two and by the way i am

943
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,039
super super excited about this report i

944
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:10,960
recommend you go download it i had no

945
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,840
play at all in it right um you can find

946
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,519
them on linkedin with that weird qr code

947
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,679
and you know if you trusted it and uh go

948
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:18,640
ahead and ask for it and i'll send you

949
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,120
the link you know so strategy two was

950
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,799
follow the money now there's the

951
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,320
visibility problem here let's talk about

952
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,760
that for a second but

953
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,840
following the money has been a great way

954
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,279
uh to follow people whether it's like

955
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,440
the mob whether it's like terrorists you

956
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,440
know uh or political campaigns that

957
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,440
maybe gone awry all kind of things right

958
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,159
so

959
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:37,679
following the money what they did was

960
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:41,360
they found 177 bitcoin addresses

961
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,200
that were known to be used by the bad

962
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,919
guys for ransomware right bitcoin if you

963
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,720
didn't know it um allows you to look at

964
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,480
the transactions and see where the money

965
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,399
is going and coming from right it's not

966
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,720
as anonymous as you really think it is

967
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,080
the weakness is getting the money out of

968
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,919
bitcoin really that's the hard part when

969
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:58,720
you have

970
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,519
5.2 billion dollars right just go to the

971
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,480
bank and cash that out right so um so

972
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,760
they realized that with the limited

973
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,120
number of visit amount of visibility

974
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,080
they had

975
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,080
despite us saying you know hey we don't

976
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,919
know what the ransoms are but we know

977
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,240
they're making a ton of money right

978
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,640
these guys have a system down right and

979
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,440
that's only limited visibility the uh

980
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,519
they kept with an estimated ransom value

981
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,519
from those ir firms of a hundred forty

982
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,760
eight thousand dollars for an attack um

983
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,159
on average that wasn't the uh you know

984
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:29,919
it's higher this year than last year but

985
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:31,360
they have more visibility and we can't

986
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,600
trust numbers right um which as a math

987
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,760
person freaks me out right but um so we

988
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,519
see that the so you can estimate you can

989
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,120
come back with defensible numbers and

990
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,600
say that hey for probably small to

991
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,080
medium enterprise right i'm at a hundred

992
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,720
fifty thousand dollars of ransom on

993
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,200
average right um

994
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,760
and uh the total value was a 400 million

995
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,039
so

996
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,519
visibility right we still only have

997
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:59,360
partial visibility 400 million versus 5

998
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,440
billion right so we don't quite know

999
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,440
what's going on yet with everything but

1000
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,440
we can at least have some numbers they

1001
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,600
can trust right which is the name of the

1002
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,520
game and risk management right you have

1003
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,599
to have something you can defend and go

1004
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:14,320
back to the bosses and try to manage the

1005
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,239
risk

1006
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,399
the illicit finance disruption efforts

1007
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,639
if we see so there's two things going to

1008
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,199
happen if we see ransom stop

1009
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:26,079
like as in ones that we know how to look

1010
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:28,480
for stop right they're going to continue

1011
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,719
sorry they're going to continue but

1012
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,560
what happens is we lose that visibility

1013
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,159
it's the whole like hey why didn't they

1014
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,079
knock out the informant you know kind of

1015
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,359
thing where it's like oh they left them

1016
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:39,679
there so you keep on forming right

1017
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,480
we have a way to see right now right um

1018
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,879
i i will bet anyone one of the delicious

1019
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,199
burgers downstairs like on any day of

1020
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,839
the week that if you make ransoms

1021
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:52,320
illegal and some business has their pers

1022
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,679
some small business will say a

1023
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:56,960
restaurant has an sba inspired loan tied

1024
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,400
at their personal credit and their house

1025
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,599
is collateral

1026
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,359
they will pay that ransom to save their

1027
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,760
family right it's going to happen that

1028
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,040
it's not even an ethics or morality

1029
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,160
question right and so um with this we

1030
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,160
actually get some visibility right now

1031
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,480
what's happening is that um there are

1032
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,839
other bitcoin uh

1033
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:17,040
technologies i'm sorry cryptocurrency

1034
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,320
technologies that's how pervasive

1035
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,040
bitcoin is right um that are out there

1036
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,320
that yeah okay cool that have um

1037
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,359
a lot of money going around not all of

1038
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:28,079
them

1039
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:31,440
allow for visibility we have into the

1040
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,240
money flowing around right in fact there

1041
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:38,640
are some that actually um are not uh

1042
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,079
they're designed so you can't they're

1043
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,400
designed to be dis decentralized without

1044
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,480
that level of tracking just so that the

1045
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,640
government can't come by and say hey uh

1046
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,800
knock down that exchange you know this

1047
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,960
is totally decentralized peer-to-peer

1048
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,320
very secure and it's in its

1049
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,400
implementation from the ground up right

1050
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,320
so we're already starting to see where

1051
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,560
some ransomware operators are moving to

1052
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,320
those cryptocurrencies

1053
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,800
my first question right on the business

1054
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,119
side was okay well do those other

1055
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:08,000
cryptocurrencies have the capacity in

1056
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,560
their financial networks to actually go

1057
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,280
ahead and execute five billion dollars

1058
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,520
in transactions right um and the answer

1059
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,440
is yes they do we see we have 1.1

1060
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,000
trillion for bitcoin ethereum is 482

1061
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,800
billion we go down number six here 56

1062
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,320
billion there's still plenty of room

1063
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,560
there right for ransomware to run all

1064
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,400
their known operations five billion

1065
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,359
dollars worth uh through there right um

1066
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,839
without really having a hitch and uh

1067
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,520
bitcoin we have visibility otherwise we

1068
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,359
don't so we may be losing that in the

1069
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:39,920
future right but we have it now so we

1070
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,920
should use it now is the point we should

1071
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,359
all download that report again i have

1072
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:44,960
nothing associated with the report but i

1073
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,640
read it and like i loved it you know

1074
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,760
because it actually gave us numbers we

1075
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,920
can rely on

1076
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,280
so on the insurance side we actually

1077
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,880
have some cool business continuity

1078
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,119
numbers now remember what i said about

1079
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,320
um

1080
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,640
sometimes you can have a survey or you

1081
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,560
have you have a report come out but the

1082
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,640
number of cases you're looking at is

1083
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,560
very low and that can poison your

1084
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,200
results unfortunately the number of

1085
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,079
claims here they only knew the ransom in

1086
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,680
the third of them so that's not good

1087
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,200
that's you're already at like what six

1088
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,520
claims and you only knew four or the six

1089
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,920
or uh but um well or you didn't know for

1090
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,680
the six but you see where you have all

1091
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,000
the numbers here for business continuity

1092
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,040
we can roughly get a ratio of about 1.6

1093
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,040
right so if you can figure out the

1094
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,680
ransom roughly something then you can

1095
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,359
start to multiply and get the business

1096
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,680
continuity pieces now you have something

1097
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,359
to work with to try to get that business

1098
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:38,000
continuity piece down right in addition

1099
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,440
to the ransom of course right you have

1100
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,000
numbers to work with to be able to

1101
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,960
convince your cfo to convince the ceo to

1102
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,000
go ahead and spend money on this right

1103
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,760
without them coming out with that eight

1104
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,960
thousand dollar ransom which has

1105
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,880
actually happened where i've had reports

1106
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,480
come back and they're just like oh no

1107
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,079
look it's gonna be a problem i got petty

1108
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,160
cash you know and i'm just like do not

1109
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,280
trust that data you know so um

1110
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,680
so really you know we're

1111
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,000
we're still not quite having things

1112
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,240
settled here on like i don't i don't

1113
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,320
have a nice story to give you to say it

1114
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,079
is definitely i'm a vendor and it is

1115
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,359
definitely this one because that makes

1116
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:15,680
me the most money you know that's just

1117
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,800
that's not what we're at right we're

1118
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,480
just kind of like we got a big problem

1119
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,359
folks

1120
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:20,720
we don't even know how big the problem

1121
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,078
is that's what i'm trying to say

1122
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,240
if if you're confused too yeah of why

1123
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,240
this guy's up here doing this yeah i get

1124
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,079
it right because like i lost it at one

1125
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:32,000
point when i saw like that ratio i like

1126
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,359
how to put down everything for like a

1127
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:34,880
week but it's like i was like i'm just

1128
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,320
do coding or something to relax me you

1129
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,880
know so um so what we do see though is

1130
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,160
that the more evidence we're getting the

1131
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,760
velocity showing it's not getting better

1132
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,960
right we are seeing that there is an 80

1133
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,280
chance that once you're a victim once

1134
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,440
you will be a victim again we have had

1135
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,960
some of our clients for our prevention

1136
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,960
product who while deciding whether to

1137
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,200
install it got hit again

1138
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,640
even before it got installed right

1139
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,839
that's happened a couple times now

1140
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:00,880
actually so um 46 from the time they

1141
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,720
think the same attackers you know what

1142
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,560
this reminds me of with ransomware's a

1143
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,640
service coming where you have more and

1144
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,480
more salesmen

1145
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,480
out there right trying you know how many

1146
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,320
of you have sales guys call all day

1147
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,760
right you know call you and leave

1148
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,440
voicemails and text you and everything

1149
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,520
else right well france tells me the same

1150
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,839
thing right so what i'm thinking we're

1151
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:22,800
starting to see now is the mafia

1152
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,440
protection money model right where the

1153
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,520
ransom's only 150k

1154
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,280
we can pretty much afford that a lot of

1155
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,640
businesses can afford that it's gonna

1156
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,560
hurt it's gonna hurt like heck but you

1157
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,960
can afford that take out a loan whatever

1158
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,280
well it's not enough to kill you it's

1159
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,520
enough to make the payment keep on going

1160
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,119
so that they can keep going back to you

1161
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:42,400
over and over again

1162
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,480
i think we're kind of heading towards

1163
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,599
there i it's just it's my gut feeling um

1164
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:48,800
i'm going to stick with it and i hope

1165
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,240
i'm wrong but i think we're going to

1166
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,839
start seeing a show up as a line item on

1167
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:53,680
our budgets right we're going to say

1168
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,000
okay this will take this much hit again

1169
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,920
it's been nine months it's about time

1170
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,079
for the mafia to come back and demand

1171
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,240
protection money again with a ransom i i

1172
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,400
just it just feels like it but again i

1173
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,920
just told you not to trust anything i

1174
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,440
ever said right all these security

1175
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,040
people say and here i am saying well

1176
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,720
trust my gut but

1177
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,760
that's kind of where the evidence is

1178
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,079
going and i would love for someone to

1179
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,480

1180
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,960

1181
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,280

1193
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:54,880
oh jeez um

1194
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,599
so um so when i was in the army um i was

1195
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:00,240
artillery and then i became an mp person

1196
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,560
so i did like missions and compliments

1197
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,880
hillary they shot you out of a cannon

1198
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,599
well it gets better so they took away

1199
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,599
that and i had like a jeep right but i

1200
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:11,760
had all of my sam's books with me

1201
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,440
because i wanted to be able to get back

1202
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,119
into i.t and security when i got back

1203
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,200
right well you know how the qurans are

1204
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,720
all like very fancy with like the

1205
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,800
threadbound and everything it's not just

1206
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,280
for looks so my sans books my security

1207
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,680
books gcse and everything else right um

1208
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,560
they were melting during missions like i

1209
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,000
pulled out and it'll be like next to

1210
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,240
like boiling hot like grenades and like

1211
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,319
you know ammo cans and everything and

1212
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:36,240
like chapters would fly out it looks

1213
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,920
super technical right you've ever had

1214
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,920
like one of the sans books so they're

1215
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,520
always like a rocky kids around that

1216
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,200
would like grab our papers and of course

1217
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,720
it looks really important right seeing

1218
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,560
like how to configure cisco router

1219
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,480
securely kind of stuff right and they

1220
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,160
always thought it was like mission stuff

1221
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,240
because they didn't read english and

1222
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,960
i'm sl i'm i was fast i was 25 or

1223
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,960
whatever but like slow compared to a

1224
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,520
rocky kid you know and i would chase

1225
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,880
them like quarter mile in the desert

1226
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,520
until like for way too many times before

1227
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,960
i realized and that's never gonna win

1228
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,200
you know and when i got back i started

1229
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,240
an i.t business and i can actually tell

1230
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,880
the chapters it was so sad that i was

1231
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,720
missing because i would get to a certain

1232
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,359
point and be like how do i do that you

1233
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:19,040
know and then like i could get my book

1234
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,720
and there'd be like a gap you know where

1235
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,359
that chapter was just gone forever and

1236
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,960
had to buy a new sam's book that's how

1237
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:29,119
it happened now that is a great fun fact

1238
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:32,319
come on give him a hand

1239
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,879
