uh so they started helping out in

63
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,920
humanitarian crowdsource efforts

64
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,320
uh in this talk the scope is more

65
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,800
directed towards

66
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,959
those who are under direct threat of

67
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:11,920
harm

68
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,120
and

69
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,800
those who are being

70
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,000
like that's through like human

71
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,120
trafficking

72
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,920
wrongly persecuted individuals if you're

73
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,840
contacting those individuals through

74
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,800
efforts led like digital dunkirk was

75
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,840
that's what this is going to be talking

76
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,800
about

77
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,160
we also have this really really cool

78
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,959
thing at the bottom it's a cowboy hat

79
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,560
back in our unit when we were still in

80
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,160
the military there was a phrase it was

81
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,400
called don't cowboy it up

82
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,720
basically what that means is i don't

83
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,560
think this is the wild wild west if you

84
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,599
start going crazy and doing things wrong

85
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,760
people can get hurt

86
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,000
and whenever you do see that cowboy hat

87
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,640
if you start messing up that region of

88
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,480
the talk this is where people could

89
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,000
potentially die

90
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,680
uh so that's kind of how drastic this

91
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,519
talk gets into

92
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,040
hit it

93
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,040
cool i've got your obligatory cat meme

94
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,840
because i promised you that i would

95
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,800
so we're going to talk we're going to go

96
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,760
over

97
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,680
what are we talking about what is a sock

98
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,360
puppet um

99
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,200
why you use one when and where to use

100
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,959
them

101
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,080
and then the differences and some

102
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,680
consequences between good and bad

103
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,440
implementations and what happens when

104
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,519
you don't do it right vice when you do

105
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,680
yeah

106
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,680
so uh what's a sock puppet other than

107
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,200
you know something that five-year-olds

108
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,599
make in their kindergarten class

109
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,920
uh a sock puppet basically is a fake

110
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,879
online persona that is used to help mask

111
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,560
your true identity

112
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,440
um from your true identity wait did i

113
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,720
say that right or i say true identity

114
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,640
twice didn't i anyways it's a fake

115
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,319
persona that you put online it's

116
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,840
normally associated with the baddies you

117
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,760
know things like russian misinformation

118
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,959
actors

119
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,080
uh apts uh three-fourths of tinder for

120
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,159
all those who are equally on that

121
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,879
application uh maybe also like half of

122
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,280
linkedin i'm sure you all have the uh

123
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,640
the people who just message you about

124
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,799
jobs that don't exist

125
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,799
ultimately stock puppets are are a way

126
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,040
that can be used in a

127
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,319
offensive

128
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,760
security mindset so when we do things

129
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,319
like social engineering campaigns or red

130
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,080
teams we don't actually use our true

131
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,760
names right i'm not going over to a

132

things like that

138
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,759
uh so why does it matter probably right

139
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,120
why do you care

140
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,199
uh why would you want to use a humanita

141
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,720
a sock puppet during a humanitarian

142
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,000
operation

143
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,680
i'm gonna hold on with both hands here

144
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,720
because i think this is really important

145
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,560
for you guys to know the baddies have

146
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,560
the internet right

147
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,520
uh this isn't the days when the taliban

148
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,280
don't know how to

149
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,759
log into google this isn't the days when

150
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,759
boko haram is like oh man i don't i

151
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,759
don't know what facebook is like the

152
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,680
baddies have the internet and literally

153
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,280
everything about you there are companies

154
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,560
out there that know more about you than

155
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,160
three letter agencies and that's that's

156
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,280
the truth

157
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,120
uh which is kind of scary

158
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,199
but for the uh for the really really

159
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,919
cheap price of 0.99 you can learn about

160
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,240
anything so if you want to be

161
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,840
you know there's a there's a

162
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,280
little

163
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,759
cowboy hat there for a reason uh because

164
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,440
this is where people start turning into

165
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,199
stalker mode right like when you start

166
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,880
learning you're like oh man i know where

167
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,160
you live i know where your cousin lives

168
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,840
like you can literally find out

169
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,919
everything about a person uh we've done

170
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,919
that on multiple occasions where we have

171
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,160
to go and find a relative an advantage

172
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,720
of an individual who is in country and

173
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,160
that individuals here in the united

174
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,440
states are their relatives here in the

175
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,479
united states

176
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,000
we could find out everything about that

177
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,720
person get their their their daughter's

178
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,199
name phone number their husband whoever

179
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,880
it may be contact them because we've

180
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,039
lost contact with those individuals

181
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,039
so it's really important to use a sock

182
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,520
puppet and this is why you know the the

183
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,479
baddies do have it

184
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,800
word so this is kind of the big bottom

185
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,440
line picture is that these fake personas

186
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,600
when you use them correctly can keep you

187
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,840
safe super short version of what's nice

188
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,440
and long on the screen they keep you

189
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,960
from being found by the people you're

190
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,160
not trying to be found by as you're

191
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,600
communicating

192
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,280
past and through

193
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,479
their

194
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,440
network capabilities

195
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,440
that was me all right so

196
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,479
where do i start how do i do this um

197
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:25,600
step one

198
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,440
sorry step negative one before you do

199
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,240
anything

200
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,080
are you ready for this

201
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,680
are you in a head space that you can

202
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,440
tolerate getting involved in this kind

203
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,720
of an operation

204
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,000
um

205
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,759
i didn't do step negative one last time

206
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,600
we got involved in this and it was a bad

207
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,440
decision because i found myself talking

208
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,960
to people that were in a lot of danger

209
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,520
and i was

210
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,680
under a lot of stress anyway i didn't go

211
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,960
well think about whether or not you can

212
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,240
tolerate this kind of activity or not

213
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,160
mentally right that's all your mental

214
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,440
capability

215
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,120
headspace

216
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,880
so then it's cash record how are you

217
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,000
going to fund this

218
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,440
we're going to go through acquiring

219
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,639
temporary service building a fake

220
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,960
persona building your presence for that

221
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,440
persona step four obviously

222
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,599
question marks and then step five

223
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,840
not actually profit it's a go live and

224
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,520
and run your operation start your

225
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,520
communications

226
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,360
are you sure

227
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,560
okay

228
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,960
then you start off with low tech

229
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,199
all right we promised we practiced these

230
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,199
slides i swear yeah like at least once

231
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,720
all right so a question you also have to

232
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,800
ask yourself is how sophisticated is the

233
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,199
hostile entity um

234
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,720
are we trying to avoid people like the

235
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,160
taliban before the fall of kabul where

236
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,759
they don't own the telecom suites they

237
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,360
don't have access to all of the network

238
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,240
stack are we trying to avoid people like

239
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,960
the anti-balaka militia or the farc who

240
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,240
are relatively

241
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,560
low technology capabilities within their

242
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,840
user space

243
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,720
or

244
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,160
are trying to avoid advanced nation

245
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,319
state adversaries

246
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,400
yeah so we like to kind of point out the

247
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,599
difference because this is something

248
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,160
that a lot of new people

249
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,560
tend to

250
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,720
not understand right they think okay

251
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,680
there's some big humanitarian crisis

252
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,280
wrongly persecuted individuals to say

253
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,720
like in china right and then they're

254
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,919
like i want to help those people via

255
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,280
online methods well like obviously

256
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,800
china's really really good at hacking

257
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,919
i'm pretty sure i don't have to tell you

258
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,080
guys that right so they're going to be

259
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,919
able to run the telecom services they're

260
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,080
going to be able to track down who you

261
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,080
are as an individual even if you are

262
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,919
starting to use vpns like we're both we

263
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,479
come from a apt-ish

264
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,958
background right um we understand that

265
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,760
it is very easy to still backtrack ways

266
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,560
through um

267
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,440
i i also put up here the cartels right

268
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,440
we all know how danger danger the

269
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,640
cartels are you don't want to mess with

270
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,160
their money stream they they'll probably

271
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,080
behead you it's kind of terrifying right

272
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,160
but they have people everywhere uh

273
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,519
that's that's something to be aware of

274
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,120
when you start messing around with uh

275
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,959
let's say human trafficking you start

276
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,040
getting into the revenue stream of

277
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,880
criminal organizations that are

278
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,399
closer to home

279
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,839
you have to start worrying about all

280
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,680
right is this going to be a problem for

281
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,720
me

282
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,399
um

283
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,600
and depending on who they are the

284
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,080
retaliation could be higher the cartel

285
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,680
is more likely going to not care if they

286
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,920
go and try to whack you china and russia

287
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,279
probably aren't going to try to murder

288
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,480
you unless you're in like the uk you

289
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,320
know somewhere that's closer to them

290
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,000
uh but

291
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,399
for this talk like that's out of scope

292
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,760
we're not going to talk about anything

293
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,839
about getting into the more advanced

294
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,080
adversarial nation states

295
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,680
seriously be careful with this if you do

296
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,200
ever get invited to

297
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,040
participate in some sort of humanitarian

298
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,440
operation that does include something

299
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,519
that would be found up here including

300
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,839
the taliban after they've taken kabul

301
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,440
then

302
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,959
maybe back out especially if you haven't

303
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,680
done this before

304
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,600
which is why there's a big big cowboy

305
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,680
hat here because that is a high danger

306
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,880
yeah this is

307
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,320
this one's scary

308
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,079
so then you gotta you know really get

309
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,000
down to down to the dirty let's start

310
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
like actually building our fake online

311
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,920
persona let's build our sock puppet you

312
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,360
got to think about the first question

313
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,959
what do you want to go cash a card i

314
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,040
think they asked us at defcon 2 which is

315
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,560
really where they take card anymore but

316
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,399
cash is king for most of the part you

317
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,079
have to weigh the pros and cons uh the

318
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,320
pros here really cool it's hard to trace

319
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,320
right uh people aren't really putting

320
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,480
down like tracking numbers on your on

321
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,959
your cards or on your cash uh it's

322
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,160
really cool when you have a lot of it

323
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,680
you feel like you're you know tony

324
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,800
montana

325
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,040
uh and leftover cash can be spent in

326
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,720
singles i'm not you know

327
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,000
saying anything but if you want to go

328
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,600
downstairs you can spend them over in

329
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,480
the

330
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,399
slot machines and whatnot

331
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,079
the cons is is not everyone's going to

332
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,040
accept this uh and there's a there's a

333
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,720
cowboy hat here because i've seen this

334
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,360
happen before uh when you go to buy your

335
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,200
equipment be that like a

336
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,000
a visa gift card or your cell phone

337
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,720
service via cash places like target

338
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,959
and

339
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,040
well actually i only can speak on target

340
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,279
because i've seen it there but uh they

341
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,279
won't accept cash for this kind of

342
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,120
transaction they want a card they want

343
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,880
some way of being able to track it it's

344
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,360
not technically illegal to do this but

345
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,720
it is

346
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,480
it's a gray area people don't like you

347
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,480
to do it uh but i've seen some guys like

348
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,560
try to like fight the cash register

349
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,600
because they're like trying to uphold

350
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,279
their own policy and i'm pretty sure

351
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,880
we've all seen that here in 2020 as

352
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,120
people just go insane or 2021.

353
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,040
um i don't remember what year it is it's

354
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,519
all learned together at this point

355
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,320
but you know just be aware of that and

356
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,600
we're not endorsing anything on the

357
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,680
screen these are just services that you

358
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,120
could use

359
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,360
everybody has their own preferences

360
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,600
but you can get your temporary cards

361
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,440
through things like do not pay or

362
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,079
privacy.com these are

363
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,760
cards that aren't associated to a name

364
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,519
so you can put any sort of name to pay

365
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,440
for your service

366
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,120
and then obviously this visa gift cards

367
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,760
you can buy via your card as well which

368
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,600
is a little weird but that only enables

369
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,279
for more financial tracking if you were

370
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,959
going against a more nation state

371
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,600
cool so now you've got your cash you've

372
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,880
got your card you've made your decision

373
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,320
how you're going to fund this first

374
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,040
thing we're going to do is we're going

375
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,800
to get ourselves a phone number so you

376
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,800
do not want to use your own personal

377
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,320
number we'll talk about why in a little

378
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,040
while it's not a good decision

379
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,240
uh you got physical phones you have

380
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,519
virtual devices physical phones are

381
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,959
obviously easier to do especially for

382
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,279
like lower tech kind of capabilities

383
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,279
people go get a track phone or an atm t

384
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,959
prepaid or i don't care i don't

385
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,240
i'm not paid by any of these guys i

386
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,000
don't care go get whatever find some way

387
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,360
to get a cell phone

388
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,040
um alternately if you've got virtual

389
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,440
devices me i'm lazy i'm a nerd i sat in

390
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,200
my chair i virtualized stuff

391
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,040
i'm not going to walmart i'm not doing

392
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,680
it bluestacks is a tool that we used

393
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,639
it lets you virtualize an android system

394
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,680
and then

395
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,920
burner app was the application that we

396
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,440
used you can pay them like what seven

397
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,040
bucks and they get you a phone number

398
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,560
that works for like two weeks so now i

399
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,839
have a phone number and we're ready to

400
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,079
move

401
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,600
okay

402
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,600
so now now you have your your cash or

403
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,440
card you have your

404
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,360
cell phone service next thing is

405
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,600
building your believable

406
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,120
persona

407
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,200
right all these photos up here aren't

408
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,959
real people that's a disclaimer you know

409
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,959
you can give a name to anybody but

410
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,000
basically you use one of these two links

411
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,079
what we would recommend right

412
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,440
this person does not exist it's actually

413
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,720
really cool if you go ahead and hit

414
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,160
refresh a few times you can see some

415
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,000
very terrifying images of like people

416
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,279
with tentacles out of their eyes it's

417
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,720
really creepy but other times you get

418
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,760
really cool things like uh you know

419
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,600
iranian seth rogen here in the middle um

420
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,360
it's my favorite one yeah

421
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,959
you know like so you get all these like

422
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,440
really cool generated images and if you

423
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,920
use the one that generated photos uh or

424
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,399
generated dot photos they uh they give a

425
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,680
little watermark on the bottom so if

426
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,199
you're good at uh powershell or

427
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,600
powershell

428
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,279
photoshop thank you

429
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,399
sorry i give too many talks on

430
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,839
powershell um then you know you can you

431
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,399
can take the watermark out and and put

432
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:07,760
it up on your facebook your twitter

433
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,040
whatever it may be

434
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,959
and then the second piece to this whole

435
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,320
story is you have to

436
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,839
build a believable

437
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,079
story of that individual right something

438
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,480
that hasn't really been mentioned yet is

439
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,240
kind of creating this like age of the

440
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,839
person uh if you go out and just build

441
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,079
yourself a sock puppet like five minutes

442
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,839
later you're using that sock puppet in

443
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,519
the wild people are gonna know

444
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,600
it's probably a sock puppet right so you

445
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,040
can build this nice little backstory and

446
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,040
it gives you the ability to remember the

447
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,040
name especially if you're communicating

448
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,519
with people who are under duress in

449
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,600
country where you're helping

450
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,959
so like you you know you go to

451
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,560
fakenamegenerator.com and it's like your

452
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,240
name is now kevin smith you're like oh

453
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,160
that's super easy to remember right or

454
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,600
or something in a sense and it gives you

455
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,199
everything like what your email address

456
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,440
should be what is your password what is

457
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,040
your social security number if you

458
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,320
really have to give something like that

459
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,320
or a credit card number your employment

460
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,240
building these backstories really helps

461
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,000
you remember

462
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,320
who you are in this persona especially

463
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,440
when you're communicating with those

464
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,959
overseas or away from from the domestic

465
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,720
united states

466
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,920
uh i think that's it for this one

467
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,560
but i don't like using those

468
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,760
so

469
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,320
our standard practice is to grab a photo

470
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,839
pick one that you like and then make fun

471
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,760
of the poor guy for five minutes

472
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,680
i mean they're not real

473
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,360
right so you can be you can you can have

474
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,279
a little fun with it right like

475
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,800
so like for this particular guy he looks

476
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,480
like he has like two first names right

477
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,160
like something

478
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,079
like what like chat

479
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,479
chat chat

480
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,720
no yeah so this is something when it's

481
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,000
blown up you can kind of see like where

482
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,920
the ai kind of screws up too yeah what

483
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,279
was mentioned is his ears are not

484
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,480
symmetrical and you're right he kind of

485
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,079
has a little bit of elf ears there right

486
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,839
so down here his caller's messed up i

487
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,279
mean there's artifacts from the from the

488
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,480
generation

489
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,920
this this guy doesn't usually look good

490
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,440
enough to work i don't know he looks

491
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,040
like a like a

492
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,920
i don't know what would you call his

493
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,839
last name

494
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,160
kent kent chet kent that's a hard name

495
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,000
to pronounce

496
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,240
right but you know so our chat here we

497
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,360
got to figure out what what his

498
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,880
occupation is what his age is where he

499
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,240
went to school maybe his job right

500
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,440
because this is stuff that's stuff

501
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,199
that's asked in like your facebook

502
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,160
profile or your twitter or your

503
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,560
uh linkedin right communication methods

504
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,880
that you would have with people overseas

505
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,639
so yeah i don't know he looks like he's

506
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,800
like mid-thirties uh i would say he's

507
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,079
probably in the military but i'm kind of

508
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,279
biased just because that haircut's a

509
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,519
little like military-ish

510
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,519
um

511
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,880
i don't know pick a school what do you

512
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,079
think

513
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,639
not pittsburgh michigan state

514
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,160
count

515
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,360
oh that's actually my hometown that

516
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,639
looks scary

517
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,600
you doing some ocean

518
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,160
all right so he's from sacramento he's

519
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,920
his name's chet wow what a great

520
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,120
probably went probably went to see kay

521
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,399
mcclatchy too

522
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,720
uh out of the military his email would

523
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,560
be something totally ridiculous like

524
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,320
like ultra chat he would have his name

525
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,600
inside of it right he looks like one of

526
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,359
those people who'd probably be

527
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,760
entertained with his own name

528
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,599
um

529
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,199
but i mean you guys get the idea right

530
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,799
like this it's a silly way of like

531
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,240
coming up with a backstory for an

532
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,400
individual that doesn't exist and you

533
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,720
have fun with it because uh this is the

534
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,880
only time you're actually gonna have fun

535
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,240
um

536
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,000
once once you start going live it starts

537
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,799
getting depressing

538
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,600
that's the wrong way is it yeah it is

539
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,320
yeah yeah there we go there we go so

540
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,679
this is awesome

541
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,039
so um

542
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,640
now we got it all done right we built

543
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,720
our persona hopefully you've aged it a

544
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,880
little bit it's not brand new if you

545
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,400
need to have friends on facebook because

546
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,600
you're trying to make it even look even

547
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,080
more believable go on fiverr it's like

548
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,080
twelve dollars to get ten thousand

549
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,240
friends i looked

550
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,799
um it's really cheap actually actually

551
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,880
if you need more followers on on youtube

552
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,960
you can get it there as well but you

553
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,240
wanna start building your actual

554
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,400
communication platform your

555
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,160
online presence

556
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,600
per se right so the first thing you want

557
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,640
to do is you're going to go out and

558
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,320
you're going to find yourself a

559
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,919
privacy based email something like

560
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,160
protonmail private on mail doesn't like

561
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,320
share it out to other people right they

562
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,160
like to say they're secure this is where

563
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,440
all your

564
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,120
information that's going to come in

565
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,640
that's potentially sensitive and what i

566
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,320
mean by sensitive is

567
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,440
when you are communicating with these

568
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,200
individuals overseas you're likely going

569
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,520
to get some pii you know their names

570
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,280
their passport numbers probably some

571
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,120
photos maybe even their country

572
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,679
identification code or number uh there's

573
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,360
a lot of stuff that you don't you know

574
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,480
you wouldn't want your social security

575
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,840
number getting out there so you want

576
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,840
people who are handling this information

577
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,080
here in the states to be handling with

578
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,400
the same sort of discretion

579
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,080
uh that's going to go to your proton

580
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:44,880
mail

581
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,919
the next thing you're going to do is

582
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,120
you're going to build yourself your

583
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,440
google or your yahoo and that's

584
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,960
kind of important because that's where

585
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,880
all your social media is going to be

586
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,559
built from uh

587
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,679
you know facebook linkedin they like to

588
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,440
pretend and say like oh we don't like

589
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,880
sock puppets you know we're against

590
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,400
stock puppets because misinformation

591
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,880
actors it's just not true

592
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,200
right uh you can build yourself a sock

593
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,320
puppet quite

594
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,600
quite easily

595
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,760
and uh they'll be like okay i guess sure

596
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,280
cool you know add a thousand friends

597
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,120
within five minutes like man yeah i'm

598
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,120
cool with this uh so your gmail you're

599
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,320
out that's gonna go towards your social

600
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,240
media accounts and then the last piece

601
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,600
is really just setting up the social

602
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,520
media accounts using that phone number

603
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,320
that you had uh set up earlier that's

604
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,440
going to go into your facebook and

605
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,520
linkedin because those require a phone

606
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,400
number

607
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,400
i think gmail does too right gmail

608
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,320
definitely does yeah yeah

609
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,440
you used to be able to get away with not

610
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,720
having a phone number now you have to

611
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,880
have one so we had to add like the first

612
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,679
three steps oh you miss your mic

613
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,480
oh this is you

614
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,040
all right so

615
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,240
[Laughter]

616
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,960
shenanigans so

617
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,120
one kind of consideration we tapped on

618
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,880
earlier was whether or not you're

619
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,960
dealing with an advanced adversary or a

620
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,039
lower tech adversary if you are dealing

621
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,000
with somebody who can monitor your

622
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,360
network traffic or is viewing everything

623
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,640
that comes in and out of the country

624
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,840
it's probably a good idea to use some

625
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,720
vpns um

626
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,679
you're definitely going to want to

627
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,360
consider where your operation is

628
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,480
happening for example if you are in

629
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,480
pakistan you want to use vpns to come

630
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,520
out of india because they're not going

631
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,880
to cooperate with each other when it

632
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,280
becomes time for

633
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,880
an investigation if they ask hey who was

634
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,559
this where was this coming from india is

635
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,240
not going to help pakistan they're not

636
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,080
so you want to make sure to consider

637
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,280
where you're coming from and where your

638
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,000
vpn pops are coming out of

639
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,840
this is actually kind of important for

640
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,120
the previous effort i don't know if

641
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,679
anybody remembers or knows about digital

642
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,679
dunkirk like the taliban as they were

643
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,679
taking over kabul right like they were

644
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,440
able to gain more and more control into

645
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,120
the telecommunication networks there

646
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,440
they were already shutting down the cell

647
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,360
service and the um

648
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,919
the internet service on sundown until

649
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,960
sunup but uh slowly but surely they were

650
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,480
capturing telecommunication points and

651
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,320
putting their own

652
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,559
network security people into monitoring

653
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,240
that activity so that's where this kind

654
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,799
of comes in as well

655
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,919
yeah so uh here comes the fun part right

656
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,120
like you've just built your whole

657
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,440
persona you you've you know we've been

658
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,640
building up to this whole point what do

659
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,720
you do now how do you uh how do you

660
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,919
communicate with the people on the

661
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:17,280
ground you're like i'm ready to help

662
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,559
people yeah

663
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,559
um so here's some things and things not

664
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,480
to do right first and foremost when you

665
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,559
start talking to people overseas like

666
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:25,679
you're

667
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,600
probably not like prior government

668
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,760
employees right we've we've had team

669
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,280
members who are not

670
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,720
you probably never handled a source

671
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,039
before uh the first and most important

672
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,320
thing to do is validate who this

673
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,679
individual is

674
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,280
right um

675
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,039
you have their information that was

676
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,039
given to you by some ngo or

677
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,720
non-government organization that's

678
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,200
helping people get out of the country or

679
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,200
maybe even somebody who is within the

680
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,000
government and they just need extra help

681
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,200
right

682
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,280
like digital dunkirk uh in this case you

683
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,720
want to validate who you're talking to

684
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,880
don't tell the information that you have

685
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,240
to that individual because then they'll

686
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,799
just be like oh yeah that's me for sure

687
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,960
right have them read you their passport

688
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,840
number have them give you their country

689
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,919
identification code right

690
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,080
be smart about this because it this this

691
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,559
part right here is is what most people

692
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,799
that were unfamiliar with these kind of

693
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,520
techniques or um

694
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,600
helping individuals screwed up on the

695
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,520
most and that caused a lot of a lot of

696
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,559
problems for us later on uh

697
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,080
only use your temporary devices for

698
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,159
communication and i will double hold

699
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,919
onto the mic again because i cannot

700
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,080
reiterate this enough do not use your

701
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,559
home computer or your home phone

702
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,720
right let's say you're looking for

703
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,919
somebody you're trying to track down

704
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,600
somebody and you find their linkedin

705
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,440
right and you're using your fake persona

706
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,559
of gabe

707
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,200
uh to go and look at linkedin's is this

708
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,960
the right individual the photo seems to

709
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,640
match up okay let's try to contact them

710
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,000
through linkedin right you're trying to

711
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
get in contact with these individuals in

712
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,600
any way possible

713
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,400
uh if you use your home computer i don't

714
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,480
know you might be logged into still your

715
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,960
account and now your account is showing

716
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,559
up in their

717
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,080
viewpoints right it's another added

718
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,919
point that if that individual gets

719
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,640
captured and some sort of like

720
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,400
investigation or sse is what we call in

721
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,720
the military is done on that individual

722
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,799
they'll find you

723
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,159
right and then they have your

724
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:19,280
information they have your name they

725
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,720
have your face they know that

726
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,400
individuals talking to americans based

727
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,480
off the conversations on their phone

728
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,320
and you're the only american in their

729
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,679
linkedin presence

730
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,280
who are they going to come and look at

731
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,440
right who are they going to harass

732
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,039
so only use your devices

733
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,799
um

734
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,320
another really important thing and for

735
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,880
any prior govi or military people in the

736
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,000
room pace which is uh a communication

737
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,840
plan primary alternate

738
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,279
contingency

739
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,120
contingency and emergency i just use

740
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,279
this all the time uh and i still can't

741
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:52,400
remember it

742
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,600
basically what that means is you want to

743
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,120
have different communication methods

744
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,600
with the person that you're talking to

745
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,600
right let's say hey my primary to

746
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,039
talking to you is going to be signal

747
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,960
because i can set these to delete after

748
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,200
five minutes uh and then once these

749
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,200
delete and the end of days has occurred

750
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,000
delete my phone number i'll contact you

751
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,559
eight am your time

752
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,240
your alternate could be all right so

753
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,320
signal's down in country because the

754
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,279
the entity that is chasing you is uh

755
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:20,799
shutting down signal traffic let's go

756
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,159
ahead and use whatsapp all right

757
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,480
whatsapp doesn't work let's use facebook

758
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,720
messenger let's use

759
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,919
uh

760
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,000
just a phone right let's straight up

761
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,080
call you on your one nine or your plus

762
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,080
one nine or your whatever country code

763
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,120
plus one nine three um

764
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,600
[Music]

765
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,600
you know have have different methods to

766
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,880
communicate with this individual but

767
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,279
also know that these individuals are

768
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,840
probably scared and they're not at the

769
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,080
same level of

770
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,520
of uh

771
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,600
clear-headed thinking as as you're gonna

772
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,080
be on your side behind a computer

773
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,360
uh so create a duress word from that if

774
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,760
they are walking through a potentially

775
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,279
scary location

776
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,840
like a checkpoint with people with guns

777
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,720
and

778
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,320
those people with guns start shooting

779
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,880
which has occurred a few times in our

780
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,919
uh

781
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,440
our efforts

782
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,000
you know have them send hey here's my oh

783
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,080
[ __ ] word right for lack of a better

784
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,880
phrase of it that's the duress word once

785
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,400
they've given you that word they should

786
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,880
know delete your phone number

787
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,159
and

788
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,480
when they remake contact with you you

789
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,880
have to start back from step one

790
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,120
validate who you're talking to

791
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,159
because you don't know that person could

792
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,240
have been captured right that person

793
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,919
could be killed and now somebody else is

794
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,279
using their cell phone they don't know

795
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,720
who they're talking to

796
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,640
uh something like that if they didn't

797
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,320
delete the number which is what happened

798
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,640
a lot of times

799
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,600
then

800
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,120
well whoa don't don't touch that button

801
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,799
just yet but we got one more section to

802
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,880
go yeah then we got the things not to do

803
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,960
this is like the put on your cowboy hat

804
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,240
right and then take it off put it to the

805
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,520
side because we're not using it here put

806
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,360
your cowboy boots down this is where it

807
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,799
gets scary right because this is what

808
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,720
gets people in trouble

809
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,240
don't have an active conversation with

810
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,559
somebody while they're on the move

811
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:05,840
this was actually a lesson learned from

812
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,279
digital dunkirk

813
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,960
which was really important

814
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,360
the taliban

815
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,279
don't like it when you talk on the phone

816
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:14,480
in their

817
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,919
checkpoint areas

818
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,600
they'll tell you get off the phone right

819
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,919
particularly if it's in english oh yes

820
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,919
especially if it's in english right

821
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,039
they're like

822
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,559
you know i'm watching you fam

823
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,640
right uh but actually way more

824
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,400
aggressive and probably not something to

825
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,720
joke about uh

826
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,240
an individual was killed in this

827
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,919
instance where they were talking to the

828
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,039
the handler on our side in english a

829
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,279
taliban checkpoint guy heard him

830
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,120
shot the guy didn't even ask questions

831
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,360
just shot him right so don't have an

832
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,880
active conversation

833
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,039
tell him what to do tell him where to go

834
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,520
drop locations but cut it at that leave

835
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,039
it a text if you have to have a

836
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,400
conversation make sure they're in a

837
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,240
secured location where they're not going

838
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,600
to be overheard by other people who

839
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,640
could potentially rat them out

840
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,159
don't group multiple contacts into the

841
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:01,279
same channel

842
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,080
right

843
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,279
uh you don't know who you're always

844
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:05,039
talking to people get captured all the

845
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,960
time especially when they're trying to

846
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,200
run out of countries if they're being

847
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,440
persecuted wrongly or

848
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,039
even human trafficking right like you

849
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,960
don't know who is who

850
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,240
and you're only a guy behind the

851
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,080
computer so make sure you're keeping

852
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,600
everybody separate it might take longer

853
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,919
but it's smarter to do it this way

854
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,559
uh do not promise anything this is for

855
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,080
your mental health

856
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,960
right

857
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,000
uh these these operations weigh a ton on

858
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,399
your on your mind especially like coming

859
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,320
from our perspective where we were

860
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,240
actively engaged in these kind of things

861
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,080
as military people and now all we can do

862
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,320
is just passively engage in these kind

863
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,480
of operations where we help out and and

864
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,960
do it on behind a computer on this side

865
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,559
and if you start promising things that's

866
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:47,840
going to weigh on your head especially

867
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,640
if you can't get that person out right

868
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,320
you're gonna be there going all right

869
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,520
yeah yeah we're gonna we're gonna get

870
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,640
you out of country we're gonna get you

871
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,880
safe if that person gets captured or

872
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,000
killed like

873
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,520
it's not gonna just leave your head of

874
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,240
like oh yeah that's that sucks no you're

875
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,240
gonna be like oh i promise this guy like

876
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,880
it's gonna weigh heavily on your soul so

877
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,120
that's your mental health keep at it

878
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,240
right

879
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,799
and uh of course the last thing is

880
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,720
don't don't forget to do the things in

881
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,159
the to-do section these things are

882
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:18,080
stressful we get it if you're new at

883
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,080
these kind of operations reach out to

884
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,520
people like us especially if you start

885
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,080
helping in these things because we're

886
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,320
more than willing to help we like opsec

887
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,960
we like having these operations continue

888
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,399
we like to help people

889
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,880
so anything we can do to make sure that

890
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,360
you as a new person in the group can

891
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,799
do it right

892
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:39,919
you know we're gonna we're gonna stop

893
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,279
we're gonna slow down we'll be like okay

894
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,039
let's let's crawl before we walk let's

895
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,480
walk for a run

896
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,000
those kind of things hit it

897
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,960
this with me again

898
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,880
all right so

899
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,880
obviously there's things to consider

900
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,960
uh traditional step five we've talked

901
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,080
about it a couple times your mental

902
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,360
health's important

903
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,200
i got to stay alive so i can help

904
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,720
i need to take care of me

905
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,000
think about what you're doing before you

906
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,279
commit to something

907
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,640
before you make promises you might not

908
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,000
be able to come through on

909
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,679
um know your limits don't take on too

910
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:11,440
many contacts right we've talked about

911
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,799
not grouping too many people into a

912
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,880
group conversation part of that happens

913
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,679
because i take on 15 20 25 contacts and

914
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,000
i can't manage all of them at once

915
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,480
don't don't do that to yourself uh we'll

916
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,799
talk about what happens if what can

917
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:27,039
happen i guess if you do that here in a

918
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,080
little bit

919
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,320
um

920
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,159
yeah um

921
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:33,600
i got they're too small over here and

922
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,919
then i got to turn around dingus so we

923
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,679
don't plan how you're going to debrief

924
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:38,960
uh how are you going to decompress from

925
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,640
this

926
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,080
how are you going to mentally remove

927
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,120
yourself from what you've been doing

928
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,159
lately

929
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,399
because again it can be very mentally

930
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,000
and emotionally taxing

931
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,520
and then understand when your

932
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,520
involvement is more of a risk than it is

933
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,760
a benefit there's value added in saying

934
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,600
hey here's a safe location this

935
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,279
checkpoint doesn't exist here's where

936
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,279
you can go here's a safe house

937
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,600
but after a point providing that

938
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,520
information might be more of a risk

939
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,320
because

940
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,039
the traffic's being monitored or

941
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,720
i can't verify that that route's safe

942
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,559
anymore so there it does there may come

943
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,720
a point where you need to go

944
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,559
it's time for me to go away i'm sorry

945
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,240
you're on your own i've done everything

946
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,720
i can i can no longer help it's more

947
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,880
dangerous for you now if i continue

948
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,480
talking to you

949
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,240
yeah there's also a really good story

950
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,840
you guys can look on the news which is

951
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,840
pretty true a group of cowboys at the

952
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,480
the last digital dunkirk they decided

953
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,799
hey we want to keep helping um you know

954
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,159
these are all prior military guys

955
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:35,120
they're like yeah we want to keep

956
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,399
helping but we want to go back in the

957
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,320
country so they brought a ton of guns

958
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,760
into pakistan

959
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,679
and then tried to fly into afghanistan

960
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:42,880
like yeah that was really going to work

961
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,760
their bud so uh you know where your risk

962
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,960
becomes more

963
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,080
or where your involvement becomes more

964
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,520
of a risk is this because now the us

965
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,039
government has to be like really dude

966
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,960
now we got to try to get them to bring

967
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,799
you back to the united states so we can

968
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,480
prosecute you here instead of using in a

969
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,000
pakistani jail

970
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,960
um

971
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,200
but you know you we all want to help we

972
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,240
get it but you have to know when to stop

973
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,399
yeah big hat on that one don't don't fly

974
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,559
to pakistan with a plane full of guns

975
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,799
it's a bad idea don't do it it does look

976
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,480
really cool though you know oh yeah we

977
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,080
uh

978
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:19,480
find a meme for that one yeah okay so um

979
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,760
all right we should have definitely

980
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,279
download one

981
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,880
that's bad okay so here's where it

982
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,480
starts to get kind of depressing but the

983
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,399
memes don't stop so sorry about that

984
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,320
guys this is this is how we defeat humor

985
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,279
in the military as we just make jokes um

986
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:34,720
but this is where we talk about the

987
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,679
consequences of bad implementation or

988
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,200
your bad implementation of ttps right

989
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,559
uh some of the things that we're going

990
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,480
to talk about here is loss of your

991
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,159
anonymity is that the right way you

992
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:48,559
pronounce that word anemone and anemone

993
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:49,760
and then

994
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,240
i can't speak english sorry guys uh

995
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,080
disclosure of privileged information

996
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,440
right uh you don't want their

997
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,559
information get out there just like you

998
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:57,679
don't want your social security getting

999
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,919
out there uh you can burn multiple

1000
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:01,760
objectives in your operation from from

1001
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,679
doing things poorly you can get

1002
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:05,840
harassment from the baddies nobody wants

1003
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,159
that and there is potential loss of life

1004
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,360
as we've already mentioned before

1005
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:14,559
so uh the risk to you the the one thing

1006
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,000
i think is really important is you need

1007
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,679
to understand that you are not always

1008
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,880
100 disconnected form from your

1009
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,960
sock puppet you're not getting the stock

1010
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,039
puppet from the government you're not on

1011
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:28,159
in the government's cover program right

1012
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:30,000
the united states administration for

1013
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,600
social security isn't giving you a brand

1014
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,399
new social security number this is you

1015
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:35,600
uh

1016
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,440
and a sophisticated enough actor can

1017
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,200
come down to track you via network

1018
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,960
tracking financial tracking right if

1019
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,120
they really wanted to get back at you

1020
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,960
they could find ways of getting back at

1021
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,320
you

1022
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,760
is that going to happen if you guys

1023
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,200
stick to what we've been saying so far

1024
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,880
probably probably not right like there's

1025
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,080
plenty of people out there that do this

1026
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,919
and they don't get caught at all and we

1027
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:56,480
don't even know who they are uh but it's

1028
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,519
on you

1029
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,519
to not get doxxed just like how it's on

1030
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,600
you to not get doxxed in the normal

1031
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,720
world if you're out there playing call

1032
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,080
of duty and you start trash talking to

1033
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,039
14 year old you know you probably should

1034
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,039
not do that because he's gonna dox you

1035
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,159
you know they don't have any they don't

1036
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:12,000
have any control over that

1037
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,679
or their own actions

1038
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,519
but what can happen so online harassment

1039
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,840
threats uh travel restrictions right if

1040
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,600
you start doing this against russia it's

1041
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,440
not a friend of russia it's not

1042
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,039
necessarily like russia's gonna be out

1043
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,279
there like oh yeah hey no i don't like

1044
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,440
that there it's just a line of people

1045
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,559
are gonna be like yeah you can't come

1046
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,640
here you can't come down to uzbekistan

1047
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,799
uh which you know for some of us that's

1048
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,159
not a problem i don't mind not going

1049
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:36,240
back to afghanistan not gonna lie

1050
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,279
uh

1051
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:38,960
and then for all you fed boys and girls

1052
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,720
out there your clearance can be put at

1053
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,960
risk here uh the fact is if you have

1054
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,399
contact with foreign contacts which you

1055
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:45,840
will if you start doing these operations

1056
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,080
you have to put in your sf86 for those

1057
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,159
who don't know what an sf-86 is it's a

1058
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,159
big long paperwork that

1059
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:53,760
that you you have to fill out it takes

1060
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,279
like a few days and you hate your life

1061
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,519
and you're like this is miserable uh

1062
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:00,240
don't do it right if you if you're

1063
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,600
a fed

1064
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,039
just you know help out other ways

1065
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,840
so now

1066
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,320
yeah we uh as you may have noticed when

1067
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,239
we missed the meme

1068
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:15,440
uh we we didn't fully update this one

1069
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,119
uh yeah you fed girls you guys can get

1070
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:19,199
out get away with this you know like

1071
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,520
you'd be good to go they'd be like

1072
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,159
particularly egregious is if in the

1073
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,679
event that somebody's phone does get

1074
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,679
captured and they say hey

1075
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:28,960
this is no longer the person you were

1076
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,119
talking to this is

1077
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:32,960
made up name x

1078
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,599
uh at say the checkpoint

1079
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,119
now you do have to say on your clearance

1080
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:38,560
paperwork yes i have been in direct

1081
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,159
contact with members of a terrorist

1082
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,918
organization and then you have to deal

1083
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:43,119
with that

1084
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:44,480
yeah if you've never had to negotiate

1085
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,000
with the taliban it's a good day it's

1086
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,280
gonna suck

1087
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,839
yeah

1088
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:50,960
okay

1089
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,639
so this isn't a real face this is a made

1090
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,320
up one just like all the others

1091
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,879
um it's also not a real name but these

1092
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,480
are examples of

1093
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,040
uh two two examples of what not to do or

1094
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,560
what happens if you do it wrong and then

1095
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,520
we'll do one good one so rebecca here uh

1096
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,880
as a single-aged middle mother found out

1097
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,599
through a friend through a friend

1098
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:08,640
through a friend through somebody who

1099
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,440
worked uh these kind of operations that

1100
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,839
digital dunkirk was ongoing

1101
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:15,440
she wanted to get involved so she did

1102
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,680
she contacted through whatever means she

1103
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,680
needed to very low technical knowledge

1104
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,599
does not know what opsec means

1105
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,359
um now that i've said that out loud up

1106
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:25,040
here

1107
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,000
not everybody is going to know what

1108
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,440
object means opsec is operational

1109
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,280
security it's the concept of how you're

1110
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,280
going to protect your operation as it's

1111
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,640
ongoing

1112
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,640
um and since that was the case

1113
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,480
we've touched on this before the hostile

1114
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,880
entity contact

1115
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,800
confiscated words are hard man her

1116
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,640
contact's phone they reverse search that

1117
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,079
phone number to get her information and

1118
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,640
then they started harassing her online

1119
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,720
and sending her personal information

1120
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,640
back to her because she was using her

1121
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,040
personal phone to make contact with our

1122
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,280
contacts in country this is why you

1123
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,400
don't do that

1124
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,000
because you do not want the taliban

1125
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,240
saying hey you live at address x and i'm

1126
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,480
coming for you and your kid

1127
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,920
you don't want that

1128
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,079
so this is an example

1129
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:10,079
of what happens if you do

1130
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:12,400
not wait follow the instructions yeah

1131
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,240
and something to point out

1132
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,320
when you when you kind of make these

1133
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,119
mistakes right whether it be

1134
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:21,200
through ignorance or through

1135
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,599
uh just bad practice this does take

1136
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,119
resources away from the ongoing

1137
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:27,359
operation right we had to take a few

1138
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:30,880
bodies and say hey let's start helping

1139
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,880
rebecca here um

1140
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,640
lock down her online persona she had

1141
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,839
like her facebook like public to

1142
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:37,119
everybody right she could accept

1143
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:39,040
messages from anybody aside from having

1144
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,480
her change her phone number we had to

1145
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,320
start like working through the list of

1146
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,160
okay how can we lock down like your

1147
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,480
online social presence so you're not

1148
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,200
getting as many like random threats from

1149
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,960
uh

1150
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,359
the taliban and i mean that is that's

1151
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:54,640
pretty stressful i don't know if any of

1152
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,000
you guys have received death threats

1153
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,599
before but that kind of sucks especially

1154
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:58,960
as a single mother

1155
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,400
right

1156
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,119
but

1157
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:03,760
at the end of the day right she got

1158
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,400
doxed ducks deduct herself don't don't

1159
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,280
do that right it's on you

1160
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,119
uh the next example is bobby and this

1161
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:12,320
guy really does kind of look like a

1162
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,560
bobby um

1163
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,560
but uh the reason we call him bobby is

1164
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,599
because bobby is also another uh name

1165
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:21,040
i'm sorry if your name is bobby but you

1166
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,720
know it's like your best friend or a

1167
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,000
blue falcon

1168
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,520
or if you guys don't know what a blue

1169
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,960
falcon is it's a guy who pretty much

1170
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,000
screws you over in your unit uh don't be

1171
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,839
a bobby i'm sorry if your name is bobby

1172
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:34,160
we've kind of singled you out here um

1173
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,240
but bobby here he was a prior government

1174
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,079
employee he had some moderate technical

1175
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:39,599
knowledge right he wasn't like dom and

1176
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,000
i.t but um

1177
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,760
he wasn't like a cyber guy he never did

1178
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,240
i.t security or anything like that uh

1179
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,480
and bobby's biggest mistake was he

1180
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,640
didn't know when to say no so

1181
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,760
as

1182
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,079
in this case digital dunkirk was ongoing

1183
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:54,880
uh

1184
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,359
he was like hey man yeah i'll take more

1185
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:58,960
like hey we got we got another 12

1186
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,400
families can you take them yeah i'll

1187
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,839
take more it ended up being like bobby

1188
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:05,200
had like 50 plus contacts inside his um

1189
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,040
his roster of things he needed to take

1190
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,040
care of right and so

1191
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,800
uh bobby thinking all right let me

1192
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,560
streamline this conversation here we

1193
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,320
needed to move all these contacts to a

1194
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,839
safe house which was a a hotel that we

1195
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:20,160
had paid somebody roughly about like ten

1196
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,680
thousand dollars of worth of like

1197
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,440
anonymous donations we had people like

1198
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,200
the whole day going all right yeah yeah

1199
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,960
let's collect some money we we gathered

1200
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,560
about ten thousand that was going to

1201
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,560
keep our contacts like a whole group i

1202
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,920
think it was closer to like a hundred

1203
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,280
people say for about like 10 days right

1204
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,599
bobby's like oh yeah no that seems cool

1205
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:38,960
i'll just group them all instead of

1206
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,200
giving the contact information or the

1207
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,640
the movement information each person

1208
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,119
individually well this is a problem

1209
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,839
right this is a problem because as those

1210
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:50,240
individuals were making their way to the

1211
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,079
safe house

1212
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,359
one of those group of families got

1213
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:54,320
captured

1214
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,760
they got stopped at a checkpoint they

1215
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,160
were arrested the phone was searched

1216
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,200
the

1217
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,960
the individual didn't have time to

1218
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,000
delete the information on there and now

1219
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,160
you have a

1220
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,640
adversary in your group chat who just

1221
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,520
scrolls up and goes hey there's a

1222
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,119
safe house information here i wonder

1223
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:14,880
what that's all about right none of the

1224
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,320
prior information was there i guess he

1225
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,200
had given the um

1226
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,880
the back story in the private

1227
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,560
information or private text there that

1228
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,960
they had deleted through signal

1229
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,880
uh the only reason we know that there

1230
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,720
was an adversary in this group was

1231
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,320
because that person started asking

1232
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,880
really really weird questions right like

1233
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,480
how many people are going to this safe

1234
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,640
house uh is this safe house within

1235
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,400
this region right which was

1236
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,359
semi-controlled by rebels forces at the

1237
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:44,720
time

1238
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,720
right they were asking very very

1239
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,720
weird jaded questions that

1240
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,160
bobby's contacted the time probably

1241
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:50,960
wouldn't have been asking they would

1242
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,480
have been like just get us there safe do

1243
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,119
it now so when we went to go actually do

1244
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:56,720
the

1245
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,320
reauthentication of who they were right

1246
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,880
reconfirm who they were uh they couldn't

1247
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,839
they couldn't give us any of the

1248
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:02,880
information that was required they

1249
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,079
couldn't give us proof of life and in

1250
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,160
that jazz and we were able to determine

1251
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,079
more than likely this guy got arrested

1252
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:10,240
uh or that contact family got arrested

1253
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,240
and um

1254
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,839
now the safe house is burned so that's

1255
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:15,280
ten thousand dollars that was thrown out

1256
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,119
the window right just like that that's

1257
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,200
not like necessarily our money but

1258
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,960
that's people who are trying to donate

1259
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,960
to a cause to make life better for those

1260
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,319
who are being wrongly persecuted in this

1261
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:26,160
case and a lot of these individuals

1262
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,599
going to that safe house we're already

1263
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,119
on the hit list for the taliban so

1264
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:30,880
that's a that's a bad day especially

1265
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,920
when they're like three-fourths of the

1266
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,000
way there and you got to go hey run just

1267
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,319
i don't care where you go hide right so

1268
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:38,800
don't be bobby bobby's

1269
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,480
kind of creepy he also doesn't have like

1270
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,119
one side of his glasses uh right so

1271
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:45,200
another ai generated problem broken

1272
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,599
glasses bobby yeah don't

1273
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:50,800
sorry bobby if you're out there

1274
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,280
all right so we talked about what

1275
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,720
happens if you do it wrong unfortunately

1276
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,920
the list of things that happen when you

1277
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,040
do it right

1278
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,560
is real short

1279
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,000
it's you don't get doxxed you don't get

1280
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,520
threatened your app doesn't get blown

1281
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,000
that's pretty much uh pretty much it if

1282
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,520
there are small issues they're small

1283
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,960
issues it's a family needs to relocate

1284
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,240
instead of

1285
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,960
80 families need to go to

1286
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,880
somewhere i don't know where we i don't

1287
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,240
know where to send them

1288
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,520
so

1289
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,480
your hiccups are small they're

1290
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,960
manageable the list's pretty short

1291
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,480
which

1292
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,319
seems sad but

1293
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,400
yeah don't do it wrong don't

1294
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,960
don't be dumb

1295
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,200
all right so also not a real face i just

1296
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,400
thought the black bar was funny and it

1297
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,359
kind of looks like one of our buddies

1298
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:39,119
this is an example of a better

1299
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:40,720
implementation

1300
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,280
pedro here fake name prior military high

1301
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,720
technical knowledge knows about opsec

1302
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,319
and knows how to implement it i'm not

1303
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:48,240
saying that because he's prior military

1304
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,959
he's better at it

1305
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,280
it's just his background

1306
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,160
um

1307
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:54,960
so

1308
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,240
this guy managed to establish

1309
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,760
communications with 50 plus contacts

1310
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,200
bunch of people different places kept

1311
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,480
them all segregated kept them all

1312
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,560
separate didn't group them together

1313
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,640
uh multiple successful ops digital

1314
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,920
dunkirk was one of them but there's been

1315
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,000
several others i don't know who this guy

1316
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,280
actually is i know him by a couple of

1317
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,280
handles that's it i don't even know who

1318
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,119
he is we've worked with him

1319
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,480
a couple times we've worked with him a

1320
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,079
few times yeah he comes from our same

1321
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:17,200
background so we were able to confirm

1322
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,640
who he was through through other

1323
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,079
channels but

1324
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:20,960
um

1325
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,319
yeah this guy

1326
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:25,280
very very sneaky even amongst the group

1327
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,119

00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,359
that detox process start your debrief uh

1345
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:58,480
take care of yourself because now

1346
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,920
now it's that time

1347
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,599
just don't keep anything

1348
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:03,440
don't keep anything it's dumb too you

1349
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,560
don't want to use that cell phone

1350
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,839
anyways you're probably getting calls

1351
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:07,040
from people you don't want to get calls

1352
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:07,839
from

1353
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:09,520
and i mean you already get enough spam

1354
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,880
calls on your home phone why would you

1355
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,880
want more spam calls

1356
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,319
right think of it that way it might be

1357
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:15,839
tempting to say hey i need to hang on to

1358
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,119
this proton mail with some information

1359
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,480
in it because what if this guy contacts

1360
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,440
me again

1361
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,560
then i have us all in all of his

1362
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,319
information we're ready to go but you do

1363
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:24,319
not want to do that because you need

1364
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:26,560
them to establish who they are to you

1365
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,520
again

1366
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,359
phone got captured email got compromised

1367
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:30,640
whatever it is

1368
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,240
it's been six hours i don't trust this

1369
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,440
number anymore i don't trust this email

1370
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,280
and i chose this facebook account prove

1371
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,200
to me you are who you are so there is no

1372
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,640
real good reason to keep any of the

1373
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,640
prior information get rid of it delete

1374
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,119
it shut the accounts down

1375
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:44,720
yeah

1376
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,960
and so because we're military we like to

1377
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,280
sandwich everything so uh now we're

1378
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,720
gonna give you a down and dirty review

1379
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,960
of what we just exactly talked about

1380
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,480
but we have about like a couple minutes

1381
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,240
left so just just to go over what we

1382
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,680
talked about we talked about no you

1383
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:58,960
should know what a stock puppet is by

1384
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,560
now if you don't like come talk to us

1385
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,720
afterwards we'll explain it better maybe

1386
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,760
probably

1387
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,960
um

1388
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,960
you should have an idea of when and and

1389
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,200
where to use them uh where to start some

1390
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,480
silly techniques to build your own stock

1391
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,520
puppy if you don't want to use name

1392
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,000
generator uh how to use them i already

1393
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,160
said that and the inherent risk and

1394
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,160
difference and consequences of

1395
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,680
of good and bad implementation right

1396
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,680
like ultimately if anything that you've

1397
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,400
learned today is that by going and

1398
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,920
cowboying it up you're gonna screw

1399
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,760
somebody else's life up

1400
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,359
right there's that potential when you

1401
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:30,960
start working in this

1402
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,160
realm

1403
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,640
of uh humanitarian operations but with

1404
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,960
that we have

1405
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,160
any any questions

1406
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:44,079

1407
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,079

1408
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:47,760

1409
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,480
no we did sorry yeah sorry we didn't

1410
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,800
