1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,240
without further ado

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,880
hold my beer ransomware operators in the

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,000
race to the bottom

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,160
okay

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,799
hello everybody thanks for coming to our

6
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:17,359
presentation hold my beer ransomware

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,920
operators and the race to the bottom

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,960
we're just going to give you like a

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,119
sneak peek at what dan and i see every

10
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:24,960
day working on the thread intel team at

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,320
kroll

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,640
so as an introduction my name is laurie

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,199
icono i'm a senior vice president with

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,239
kroll cyber risk i manage the day-to-day

15
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,399
of our threat intelligence team

16
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,719
i was formerly a program manager at the

17
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,399
national cyber forensics training

18
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,600
alliance and i also teach cyber crime at

19
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,520
a couple of the local universities

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,920
including university of pittsburgh and

21
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,600
robert morris university which is where

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,760
i met my co-speaker dan i'll let him

23
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,719
introduce himself

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,920
oh hello i'm dan cox i've been with

25
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,719
kroll for about a year and a half now

26
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,559
it's i started off

27
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,119
cyber security at robert morris i went

28
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,280
through their masters in cyber intel and

29
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,280
investigations and that's how i met

30
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,520
laurie and then ended up working at crow

31
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,960
and now do

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,119
i do a bunch of ransomware stuff dark

33
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,640
web research

34
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,560
um really just anything that comes

35
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,159
through we kind of do a mix of

36
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,520
everything

37
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,920
um so yeah lots of ocean research and

38
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,680
lots of ransomware research

39
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,520
so what we're going to talk about today

40
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,439
is we're going to cover kind of like we

41
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,360
are here like kind of the current state

42
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,320
of ransomware as we're seeing it working

43
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,479
in an incident response practice we're

44
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,000
going to talk a little bit about how we

45
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,840
got here so some factors that we think

46
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,479
kind of led us to this current state

47
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,840
and then we're going to talk a lot about

48
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,079
what we're learning along the way uh

49
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,240
specifically what we're learning from

50
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,320
some of the thread actor shaming sites

51
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,000
which dan has done a lot of work kind of

52
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,200
drilling into the analysis of those

53
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,000
so

54
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,159
talking about we are here

55
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,520
you can see this navy line on this slide

56
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,280
here this basically represents the

57
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,640
distribution

58
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,560
of threat incident types that we're

59
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,280
seeing in our incident response practice

60
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,360
that navy line is representing

61
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,560
ransomware

62
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,000
and you can see that that is far and

63
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,680
above the other

64
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,160
lines on the chart that's because

65
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,720
except for quarter one uh when we had

66
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,280
microsoft exchange proxy logon uh

67
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,920
ransomware is by far the most frequent

68
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,760
uh threat incident type that we see in

69
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,160
our ransomware cases or in our incident

70
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,400
response cases and it's actually been

71
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,680
like that since august 2019 so it's been

72
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,160
holding steady for about two years uh

73
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,400
prior to that time we would see a lot

74
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,480
more like email compromise a lot more

75
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,120
unauthorized access cases but starting

76
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,760
in august 2019 we started to see

77
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,200
a big rise in the frequency of

78
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,879
ransomware and that has pretty much held

79
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,200
steady since then like i said except for

80
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,519
the little little uh

81
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,200
skewing the results with microsoft

82
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,840
exchange earlier this year

83
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,360
the next thing that we've been seeing a

84
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,760
lot of in our practice is the use of

85
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,440
these what they call double extortion

86
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,560
tactics

87
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,800
so the ransomware groups they're not

88
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,200
just encrypting networks but before they

89
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,720
encrypt the network they're going in

90
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,879
they're exfiltrating data

91
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,120
and then the extortion component at the

92
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,080
end

93
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,760
first of all they're extorting you know

94
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,760
pay us for the decrypter but they're

95
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,920
also saying pay us or we're going to

96
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,720
post that stolen data on one of our

97
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,519
actor-controlled leak sites basically

98
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,200
and these actor-controlled sites these

99
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,599
are basically like the ransomware gangs

100
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,440
will put up their own kind of branded

101
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,360
site where they're posting the victim

102
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,560
data

103
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,400
we are seeing in our

104
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,959
in the ransomware cases we see it crawl

105
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,599
about 86 percent of them right now are

106
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,760
associated with this double extortion

107
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,959
tactic

108
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,280
we did a similar analysis of this about

109
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,480
a year ago

110
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,640
and we were about 40 percent

111
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,560
so the use of this tactic has about more

112
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,400
than doubled in

113
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,920
in a year's time

114
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,920
and you can also see here the growth of

115
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,280
these sites

116
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,920
in 2021

117
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,560
the bars here represent like unique new

118
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,879
sites that we observed during the year

119
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,840
so there was a big spike from q2 to q3

120
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,279
of different groups

121
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,918
adopting this tactic

122
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,320
so i want a little i want to go

123
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,560
into a little bit of flashback here kind

124
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,240
of talk about the ransomware as a

125
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,000
service model

126
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,840
and one of the groups that really

127
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,320
popularized this model was gand crab

128
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,919
ransomware here you can see their

129
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,440
landing page

130
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,759
they were very active from

131
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,560
about january 2018 to may 2019

132
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,120
and this group um they kind of i don't

133
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,639
know that they were the first to use the

134
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,400
service but they definitely like really

135
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,919
popularized it and kind of brought it to

136
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,360
the mainstream

137
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,520
a ransomware as a service is is

138
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,840
essentially a model where the the

139
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,360
ransomware operators kind of like

140
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,680
outsource the distribution of the

141
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,600
ransomware to affiliates

142
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,400
then those affiliates get a a cut of the

143
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,720
ransom proceeds so this helps those

144
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,360
ransomware games kind of force multiply

145
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,960
how many targets they're able to go

146
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,479
after because they're using this huge

147
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,320
network of affiliates to actually

148
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,919
distribute it

149
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,280
when gan crab retired in may 2019 they

150
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,120
made a pretty big post they like a

151
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,880
retirement a

152
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,400
little letter on one of the dark web

153
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,639
forums and they claim that they had made

154
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,400
2 billion u.s dollars in that 18 months

155
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,479
now this is a threat actor this is what

156
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,080
a threat actor is claiming so we don't

157
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,240
know how accurate that 2 billion dollars

158
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:36,960
is

159
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,560
but we know that it's fair to say that

160
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,560
they made quite a bit of money

161
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,440
in that time so if you remember that

162
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,280
two slides ago i mentioned that it was

163
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,240
august 2019 that kroll started to see so

164
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,039
many ransomware cases in our caseload

165
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,720
so it's very likely that a lot of other

166
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,720
groups at that time a lot of other cyber

167
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,360
criminals saw how profitable this was

168
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,039
and started getting into the ransomware

169
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,440
gang game

170
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,479
the next

171
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,360
kind of flashback here this is the maze

172
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,639
news site

173
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,720
this site was one of the first of the

174
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,880
actor-controlled sites

175
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,720
so may's crew was really the first

176
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,800
ransomware group to

177
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,840
threaten this kind of data publication

178
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,639
and then actually carry out carry it out

179
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,639
and post data

180
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,520
this site went up in may

181
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,120
2019

182
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,560
it was eventually

183
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,039
they eventually retired in november of

184
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,759
last year but the site was quite up for

185
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,880
quite some time hundreds of victims um

186
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,280
you know they would definitely post

187
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,960
after an attack

188
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,039
if people paid the ransom they would

189
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,120
take the data down actually they would

190
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,120
remove it from their site we had

191
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,400
unfortunately some clients that that

192
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,160
happened to and we would see proof that

193
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,560
they did at least delete it from their

194
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,759
site

195
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,680
another one of the groups that quickly

196
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,560
adopted this double extortion method and

197
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,199
and set up an actor-controlled site was

198
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,479
the

199
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,560
rival gang

200
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,560
they set up their site is called happy

201
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,680
blog

202
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,360
so they were the second ones to kind of

203
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,639
get into this method and they kind of

204
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,039
like gave it a lot of personal flavor i

205
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,720
guess i would say

206
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,160
so they would kind of like write these

207
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,240
letters about their victims

208
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,919
kind of trolling their victims

209
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,199
essentially

210
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,039
so we've seen

211
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,800
they've went after a lot of law firms

212
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,199
that had high profile clients so they've

213
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,800
trolled everyone pretty much from like

214
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,720
lady gaga to

215
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,960
donald trump on their site

216
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,199
this summer they're also the first of at

217
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,800
least what we've observed of the

218
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,479
ransomware groups using what we would

219
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,039
call sextortion tactics

220
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,120
they were threatening this one ceo that

221
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,639
if they didn't pay they were going to

222
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,680
basically

223
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,680
post a dick pic

224
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,000
they did not pay and they actually

225
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,840
posted the dick pic

226
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,879
i think my question as a cyber security

227
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,199
professional is why the ceo

228
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,680
of a significant company would have a

229
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,360
dick pic on his work computer

230
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,520
but he did and they found it so that's

231
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,120
the kind of things that these gangs are

232
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,720
going after

233
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,879
so obviously most people in this room

234
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,639
are surely familiar with the cassaya

235
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,319
supply chain attack that happened in

236
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,440
july

237
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,720
rival went on hiatus after that

238
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,720
they came up for a few weeks the end of

239
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,919
september

240
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,680
but now they are

241
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,160
down officially as of monday and last

242
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,680
yesterday there was an article released

243
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,720
that it looks like that was

244
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,559
international law enforcement

245
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,479
cooperation actually bring that site

246
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,519
down so hopefully they've been disrupted

247
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,039
i want to talk a little bit more i know

248
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,599
i've been talking about the exfiltration

249
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,760
and the actor controlled sites there are

250
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,680
other tactics that we've definitely seen

251
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,200
them using

252
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,440
during the negotiation period

253
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,240
one of those tactics is ddos

254
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,959
and i will say we've seen the threat of

255
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,640
ddos be used

256
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,519
so avadon here on the screen avidon and

257
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,000
suncrypt both of those variants threaten

258
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,160
to basically ddos

259
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,959
victims during the negotiation periods

260
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,200
we haven't observed in our caseload that

261
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,200
anyone's actually like had a successful

262
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,440
ddos attack as as during the

263
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,600
negotiations but it's one of those other

264
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,440
things that they're threatening them

265
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,760
one thing that we have observed quite

266
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,000
frequently unfortunately for our clients

267
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,120
is this

268
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,320
tactic of cold calling the victims

269
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,640
the dark side ransomware gang

270
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,279
they kind of were kind of marketing this

271
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,959
on the dark web

272
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,040
earlier this year kind of how

273
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,880
you know we have this call center that

274
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,560
we're using and if you're an affiliate

275
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,160
of ours we'll basically you know have

276
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,800
this this call center will be calling

277
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,800
the contacts of the company to try to

278
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,040
get them to pay the ransom

279
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,279
and we saw a lot of that that happened

280
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,959
to a lot of our clients almost like

281
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,200
within days of that post

282
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,279
going up on the dark web

283
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,360
um another tactic that we've seen them

284
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,240
use is emailing victim clients or

285
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,320
basically like the clients or customers

286
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,720
of the victim organization so you see

287
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,480
here this email from the klopp

288
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,240
ransomware group saying your personal

289
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,240
data has been stolen and will be

290
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,760
published

291
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,360
we've seen them

292
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,760
do this so a couple like i know the maze

293
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,560
team

294
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,079
at one point they were going after

295
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,399
patients at a plastic surgery center

296
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,279
saying we'll share your before pictures

297
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,839
they went we saw them go after

298
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,120
patients for a rehab clinic we'll share

299
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,040
pictures that are related to your drug

300
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,040
use if your clinic doesn't pay the

301
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,079
ransom

302
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,160
and we've also seen another group

303
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,399
actually go after victims of

304
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,160
i wouldn't say victims it was patients

305
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,120
at a celebrity hair club for men

306
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,880
so they were kind of telling them we

307
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,880
were going to show we're going to show

308
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,160
the world that you guys are actually

309
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,480
have hair transplants um so it just kind

310
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,240
of shows you know how low some of these

311
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,839
groups will go and trying to get their

312
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,000
ransom payment

313
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,800
so we can't talk about ransomware in

314
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,880
2021 without mentioning the colonial

315
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,320
pipeline attack

316
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,920
and that was which darkseid was

317
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,680
responsible for

318
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,519
in the wake of that obviously everyone

319
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,760
in this room knows

320
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,279
you know how

321
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,200
devastating ransomware can be but this

322
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,040
kind of brought it into the mainstream

323
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,360
all of a sudden the media was engaged

324
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,560
and obviously there was a lot of law

325
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,040
enforcement law enforcement scrutiny on

326
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,240
some of these forums that had

327
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,240
heretofore been kind of harboring some

328
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,760
of this activity when it comes to the

329
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,320
ransomware as a service ecosphere

330
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,640
so they quickly kind of banned uh some

331
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,040
of this activity on their forums now

332
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,959
since that we've seen you know obviously

333
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,440
it's a ban on a cyber criminal forum so

334
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,480
you know we will use that term lightly

335
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,480
but they definitely shy away from using

336
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,240
the word ransomware because they know

337
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,640
how much attention it attracts um so we

338
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,560
definitely see them using kind of code

339
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,680
words

340
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,440
trying to still accomplish the same

341
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,480
thing

342
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,920
and we've also seen a lot of the

343
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,839
ransomware activity actually transfer

344
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,040
over

345
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,120
to a new forum that came up i think in

346
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,480
like july

347
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,160
a ramp forum

348
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,399
and that one has a little higher bar to

349
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,839
entry probably because they want to

350
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,240
avoid some of the looky-loos that were

351
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,399
coming into the forums in the wake of

352
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,240
colonial pipeline

353
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,839
so some of the other things that we've

354
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,240
seen on the shaming sites since that

355
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,200
time

356
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,360
first of all is that you know we saw

357
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,959
that rise from q2 to q3 and more actors

358
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,440
putting up these actor-controlled sites

359
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,519
where they were dumping data

360
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,079
we've seen a lot of actors pivot to just

361
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,800
exfiltration so they're not even using a

362
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,639
ransomware to encrypt

363
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,160
they're just going into the system

364
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,519
they're stealing the data and then

365
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,480
they're extorting it to try to you know

366
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,959
prevent some kind of data publication uh

367
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,040
we've also seen a lot of doxing on the

368
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,800
site since then

369
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,600
so you know sometimes they get people

370
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,000
get immune sometimes to like okay well

371
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,320
so what my data's dumped um so the

372
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,760
threat actors constantly have to keep

373
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,079
ratcheting it up um so we've seen a lot

374
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,079
of our clients like sensitive data like

375
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,160
plain text passwords has been dumped on

376
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,079
some of these sites

377
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,560
in the past couple of weeks we've also

378
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,839
seen

379
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,440
my

380
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,000
let me see

381
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,800
we've also seen some rhetoric from some

382
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,880
of these groups coming out against

383
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,839
recovery companies so recovery companies

384
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,079
are basically third parties

385
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,920
that some of the victims will use to

386
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,680
kind of help them negotiate with that

387
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,399
threat actor to try to lower the ransom

388
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,399
demands and a lot of times that is

389
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,240
successful and they are able to get a

390
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,880
significant reduction in that ransom

391
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,120
so some of the groups ragnar locker and

392
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,519
grief this is just an example of them

393
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,760
coming out earlier this

394
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,760
i think it was a couple months ago but

395
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,760
they basically come out and said

396
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,680
if you work with a recovery company or

397
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,360
we think you're working with a recovery

398
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,880
company we will just delete all your

399
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,959
data showing they were kind of trying to

400
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,720
play hardball with these groups we

401
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,040
haven't actually seen them do that but

402
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,399
it's just another threat that they have

403
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:01,680
made

404
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,839
another thing that we have seen as you

405
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,440
can tell this is why we called it hold

406
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,360
my beer because every day when we think

407
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,199
that the ransomware groups can't top

408
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,600
themselves dan and i are messaging each

409
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,040
other the next day that we can't believe

410
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,639
what they did um so this was one where

411
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,160
lock bit ransomware they've been

412
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,040
especially active after uh after the

413
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,720
dark side shutdown

414
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,480
they started soliciting actually for

415
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,279
insiders to help them launch malware

416
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,880
so this uh image here this actually

417
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,720
shows up after a victim has been

418
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,839
encrypted

419
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,760
the wallpaper will say all your files

420
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,760
are encrypted and it will also put up a

421
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,440
little advertisement

422
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,040
saying that if you want to make millions

423
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,199
of dollars you can work with us giving

424
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,480
us passwords

425
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,959
to vpn or rdp to help us get into

426
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,320
networks

427
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,800
so you know we're talking about insiders

428
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,680
and they're going after insiders in our

429
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,600
you know industry in the cyber security

430
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,320
industry probably with that posting but

431
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,160
now that this ransomware landscape is

432
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,600
kind of spread out we've got all these

433
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,839
affiliates we've got all these different

434
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,839
kind of pieces of the pie that are

435
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,760
feeding into a ransomware as a service

436
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,199
operation

437
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,720
that means that there's more likely to

438
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,959
be individuals within that ransomware

439
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,199
supply chain that may be disgruntled and

440
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,199
end up sharing information

441
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,360
so this happened in august this was a

442
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,120
disgruntled affiliate that was

443
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,199
associated with conti

444
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,800
ransomware

445
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,760
he actually dumped basically a training

446
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,800
manual

447
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,000
that's what they give their new

448
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,320
affiliates to help them launch

449
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,560
ransomware and in that training manual

450
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,560
there's a lot of technical details about

451
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,399
the tooling that they use about how they

452
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,399
move through networks that we were able

453
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,920
to share with our

454
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,839
detection and monitoring teams as well

455
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,759
as our forensic examiners for threat

456
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,160
hunting but for the purposes of this

457
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,920
presentation i'm going to focus in on

458
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,440
what we learn

459
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,920
when it comes to exfiltration one of the

460
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,399
things they were told basically is

461
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,839
that's one of the first things they

462
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,360
should do when they're in the network is

463
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,440
start that exfiltration so it kind of

464
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,759
highlights how important that is to them

465
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,800
as a part of these attacks and some of

466
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,240
the things that they were told to look

467
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,639
for are items related to finance

468
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:11,759
accounting

469
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,240
clients so as we said before they tend

470
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,480
to go after clients and customers um

471
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,240
they're also told that what's especially

472
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,480
important for them to go after our

473
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,360
documentation related to cyber insurance

474
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,680
policies so it's lately that they're

475
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,199
trying to look at a cyber insurance

476
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,680
policy see um you know what they may be

477
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,399
insured for and use that as some kind of

478
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,920
leverage when they go into the

479
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,560
negotiations

480
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,079
i have talked a lot about that

481
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,639
exfiltration piece and then dan's going

482
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,160
to talk a little bit more about those

483
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,399
sites and what actually happens

484
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,040
with the data

485
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,360
okay there we go

486
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,720
oh yeah so looking at the different

487
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,199
actor controlled shaming sites um i

488
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,880
believe last night

489
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,480
the most updated account that we had was

490
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,199
34.

491
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,079
yeah

492
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:17,159
um there we go i just won't touch this

493
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,520
okay

494
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,520
was that better okay

495
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,880
yeah so last night we had counted that

496
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,959
there were 34 active

497
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,039
actor controlled sites where they're

498
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,200
leaking victim data and threatening to

499
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,320
post

500
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,679
different attacks onto their websites

501
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:34,720
so there's

502
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,320
on the sites

503
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,960
there's always the large claims of oh we

504
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,120
hacked x company and we stole two

505
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,200
terabytes of data if they don't pay us

506
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,039
in a week we're going to post that data

507
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,400
onto our site

508
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,840
i mean when you actually look at the

509
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,080
sites every day and break them down

510
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,679
you can see that that's not usually the

511
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,960
case with the sites

512
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,600
there is data posted to most of them and

513
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,880
yes it is

514
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,280
normally a large amount of data but

515
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,280
it really depends on the group if

516
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,039
they're going to post that data when

517
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,320
they will post that data how much data

518
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,400
and then actually whenever you get into

519
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,720
trying to retrieve the data

520
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,000
there's a lot of troubles that you run

521
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,559
into with that

522
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,520
so for these different cases

523
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,200
uh what we typically see is the post

524
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,600
will go up about two to three weeks

525
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,320
after the initial attack

526
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,840
and then with that you'll have a

527
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,520
countdown timer that'll start anywhere

528
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,559
from four days to two weeks to a month

529
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,559
that it gives the victim time to

530
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,160
negotiate and decide if they're going to

531
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,000
pay the ransom or not

532
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,840
if they do not pay they'll move on to

533
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,440
leaking screenshots

534
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,600
where like you saw with lori sometimes

535
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,240
they contain plain text passwords

536
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,600
they might be

537
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,760
personal information documents whether

538
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,840
that be passports driver's license of

539
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,840
employees

540
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,600
student records if it was a school

541
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,440
different things like that and that's

542
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,200
all in a push to actually get the victim

543
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,520
to pay the ransom to remove the data

544
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,919
from their site

545
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,600
whenever you go through

546
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,280
most of the different negotiating

547
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,320
companies

548
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,039
one thing that you'll see very common is

549
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,240
that they get the negotiation extended

550
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,919
and usually that just drags it on long

551
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,600
enough so that they can keep working

552
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,160
down the threat actors price

553
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,240
and then after so long though whenever

554
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,480
the countdown does finally expire

555
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,400
they'll release the data either all at

556
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,720
once in one bulk download or it'll come

557
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,480
out in different parts

558
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,320
and we've seen the parts leak anywhere

559
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,480
from over a few days to over a few

560
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,400
months that that data will slowly

561
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,320
trickle out and then eventually that

562
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,399
data will get published onto their site

563
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,440
so for most of our different clients if

564
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,120
data does appear on the sites we do go

565
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,200
out and retrieve that data and just a

566
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,480
few different things that we've noticed

567
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,600
with that

568
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,679
is over tor

569
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,360
the connection is always very slow and

570
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,880
it's very spotty

571
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,720
to say group does actually go out and

572
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,200
post a terabyte onto one of their tour

573
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,320
sites

574
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,000
it's very hard to actually retrieve that

575
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,480
data set and then work with it

576
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,080
you might be looking at a download that

577
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,840
takes up to two weeks

578
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,919
and your normal just person visiting

579
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,360
these sites probably doesn't have the

580
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,760
infrastructure set up and prepared to

581
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,120
download

582
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,679
any random victims data that they see

583
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,880
fit that would take up to two weeks

584
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,320
so then the data might not actually get

585
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,000
published they might get to the

586
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,320
screenshots phase and dumping the proof

587
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,840
and then not actually move forwards with

588
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,679
anything

589
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,440
the different things some of the groups

590
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,679
will post to different third-party sites

591
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,280
like mega

592
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,440
there's send space onedrive that they'll

593
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,039
put the data on to

594
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,720
and with that that actually opens the

595
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,200
door to where we can contact that

596
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,039
provider and then have the data removed

597
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,880
from the site

598
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,960
and then with the groups deleting data

599
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,480
occasionally like we just saw with

600
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,200
reaval where their site was taken down

601
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,280
that takes all the data links off with

602
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,640
it

603
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,480
and then so with that

604
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,080
yes your data may have been posted to

605
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,440
the site

606
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,039
but looking at how long the data will

607
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,559
actually stay live

608
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,960
and how long it's actually maintainable

609
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,720
is a very large statistics that we'll

610
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,320
look into to try and help out some of

611
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,720
our different clients

612
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,760
all right this thing is

613
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,559
let's try this way

614
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,919
nope

615
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,240
okay

616
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,000
so yeah looking across the different

617
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,200
sites there's a bunch of different

618
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,960
statistics that you can pull to actually

619
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,120
analyze the group and it's slightly

620
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,640
different than looking at their actual

621
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,679
attacks

622
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,840
whether that be their

623
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,320
iocs or ttps that they're using on their

624
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,440
attacks

625
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,600
this is slightly different of their ttps

626
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,760
into just their shaming sites

627
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,320
and how that victim data kind of gets

628
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,120
performed and may appear onto the dark

629
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,840
web if they don't pay this ransom

630
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,880
so some of the different things that you

631
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,159
can look at

632
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,120
some of the different things that you

633
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,360
can look at is the actual victims that

634
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,360
make it to the site versus the number of

635
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,280
victims that actually have data

636
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,000
published with that listing

637
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,320
there is the claim data that the threat

638
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,159
actors claim to have xfilled from their

639
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:19,360
network

640
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,000
and then it's typically much less that

641
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,240
they actually will post to the site um

642
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,919
so we get to kind of see both sides of

643
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,280
that we'll be looking through the

644
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,000
network traffic to look at exfiltration

645
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,320
most of the time what the actors claim

646
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,320
instantly you can rule out that it's a

647
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,880
lot higher than what we saw

648
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,960
but occasionally there will be or you'll

649
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,559
see them next fill maybe a terabyte and

650
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,559
a half and that terabyte in half does

651
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,600
appear onto the site

652
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,840
like i mentioned with using the

653
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,480
third-party providers to host this data

654
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,400
there's different statistics that you

655
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,799
can pull with looking at how long do

656
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,679
those links stay online before the third

657
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,000
party provider would remove those

658
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
and then what we've also seen is actors

659
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,120
upload to sites like anan files

660
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,799
where the link will actually expire

661
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,360
after a set period of time

662
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,039
so yes your data may appear onto the

663
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,000
site

664
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,679
but will it still be there in a week in

665
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,679
two weeks once this becomes public

666
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,200
knowledge and actually out there

667
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,400
so with those different statistics

668
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,159
we've kind of provided those to our

669
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,240
clients just to give them an idea of

670
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,679
here's the different timeline that we

671
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,440
expect to see with this group

672
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,880
here's what we expect to see with the

673
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,640
data that does get posted and here's how

674
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,559
long that data is expected to stay

675
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,840
online if it does appear

676
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,039
okay there we go oh

677
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,240
maybe not

678
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,120
okay

679
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,320
as the different groups that we looked

680
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,559
at just for this analysis was black

681
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,400
matter which is the alleged dark side

682
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,880
from the colonial pipeline hack

683
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,600
we have defray 777 who's going by

684
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,320
ransomyxx now they've been around for a

685
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,600
few years now

686
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,200
but more within the past year they've

687
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,159
moved to the shaming site model

688
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,320
hive is a newer variant that we saw at

689
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,919
the beginning of the year

690
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,679
they're pretty nasty

691
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,600
they tend to whenever they get into a

692
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,679
network they'll generate their own

693
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,200
encryption keys

694
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,799
and sometimes we'll notice that the

695
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,760
encryption keys will get put into memory

696
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,919
so that way then if the victim restarts

697
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,320
the computer at all those keys are lost

698
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,919
and decryption would just not be

699
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,200
possible even if they did pay the ransom

700
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,919
we have freeville slash sadena

701
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,919
this is with the cassette attack and

702
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,440
like lori mentioned

703
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,520
they're actually seized right now and

704
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,600
looking for different models to move

705
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,360
i'm in that group actually last week

706
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,559
they were posting about that they

707
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,120
believe their servers were compromised

708
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,559
and then yesterday we found out that the

709
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,240
servers actually were compromised by law

710
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,960
enforcement

711
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,480
and then we looked at vice society

712
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,720
which is suspected to be a hello kitty

713
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,880
spin-off and hello kitty has been around

714
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,600
for

715
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,919
at least two years now they have many

716
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,000
different spin-off variants and each of

717
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,120
their sites

718
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,880
or each of their variants will get their

719
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,120
own shaming site

720
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,520
but typically what we see with those is

721
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,039
they're only online for about a month or

722
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,880
two and then they'll pivot to using a

723
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,039
different name but vice society with

724
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,720
them has been active for about eight to

725
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,960
ten months now

726
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,880
and then we have zing walker which is

727
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,360
suspected variant of matlocker

728
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,679
zing lockers actually has gone down

729
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:28,799
right now

730
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:29,600
and

731
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,679
believed to be a new group called

732
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,279
quantum locker

733
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,720
and they've kind of shipped it shifted

734
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,799
their tactics over the different courses

735
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,159
of their variants

736
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,919
but through each variant like we saw

737
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,760
with mount locker they would post a

738
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,360
victim

739
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,520
and then two or three days later

740
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,279
the victim would appear on the next site

741
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,120
which would have been astrologer so the

742
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,120
same exact victim same exact data as

743
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,159
posted

744
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:53,520
and then we saw them do the same thing

745
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,080
with astro to zinglocker and then now

746
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,200
zinglocker to quantum locker

747
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,120
and then on the right there we just have

748
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,440
a total victim count of what we scraped

749
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,120
this was from i believe about two weeks

750
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,000
ago

751
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,919
for the active victims on each of the

752
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:08,799
sites

753
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,240
who can show me my water please

754
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:25,000
the powerpoint is on another level

755
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,120
yeah yeah i know

756
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,720
what is it pressing

757
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,279
why am i doing that i have no idea is it

758
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,600
the clicker

759
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,840
okay oh no it's not that quick is it

760
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,000
this quick

761
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,760
okay if we can get this stay on one

762
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,120
slide there we go

763
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,360
all right so whenever we want to go pull

764
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,679
the statistics

765
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,600
different shaming sites we actually

766
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,279
still had the rival site was still

767
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,840
online this was only a few days before

768
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,679
their operator

769
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:28,640
stated that their servers were

770
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,919
compromised and shut down their

771
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,600
operations

772
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,760
i mean as you saw on this last slide

773
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,320
they had about 250 victims listed to

774
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,760
their site

775
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,120
but then whenever we moved to

776
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,200
okay there we go so you saw that they

777
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,360
had about 250 victims posted which was

778
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,120
far more than the second

779
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,880
but whenever we look at the actual toted

780
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,799
data that was live on their site there

781
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,120
was only around 40 gigs

782
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,600
which then compared to like zing locker

783
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,240
with 1.3 terabytes where they only had

784
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,480
about 20 victims so you can just see

785
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,559
instantly the giant

786
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,159
kind of variances between the groups on

787
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:09,520
how much data they would put up per

788
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,039
listing and how many listings would

789
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,640
actually stay active

790
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,480
i mean so whenever we broke that down

791
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,559
for average per victim

792
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,840
i can see with hive where they had

793
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,520
please stay there we go

794
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,360
they had 25 victims listed onto their

795
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,679
site

796
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,799
but only 0.07 gigs of data actually ever

797
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,399
was posted to the site

798
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,799
um and so then if we look at the sites

799
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,399
like blackmatter and zinglocker who are

800
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,480
posting large zip files of several

801
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,919
hundred gigs

802
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,039
down to hive which might post a kilobyte

803
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,799
a few megabytes

804
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,360
there's just a large variance there and

805
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,120
so then knowing that coming into the

806
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,279
actual investigation where from day one

807
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,880
you can say this is what we expect from

808
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,919
this group

809
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,240
um say it's zing locker we're expecting

810
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,720
a lot of data exfiltration whereas hive

811
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,640
we can tell the incident response team

812
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,760
that there may not be as much

813
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,919
exfiltration i mean they still look

814
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,320
around but we're not looking at too much

815
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,880
of a risk to get onto the site

816
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,440
let me try clicking

817
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,480
is that the next one

818
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,799
oh yeah so this is looking at the actual

819
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,720
um victims with that are posted to the

820
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,440
site versus the victims with actual data

821
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,600
onto their posting

822
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,840
so we have zing locker vice society and

823
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,880
defray if you made it onto their site

824
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,200
your data was going to appear onto the

825
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,399
site

826
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,880
compared to variants like reveal

827
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,600
where you only have about a 25 chance if

828
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,760
you get posted to this site

829
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,399
is that actually going to leak

830
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:43,919
and then moving over to the right side

831
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,320
here the trend that we can see with the

832
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,000
different groups is how long that data

833
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,919
would actually stay live

834
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,960
so revo had about 250 victims

835
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,799
but only 10 percent of their download

836
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,880
links had stayed online and this goes

837
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,039
back to victims ranging back to about

838
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,760
early to mid 2020 was the earliest one

839
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,480
on there up to several days ago before

840
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,679
they were shut down they were still

841
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,159
adding new victims

842
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,039
okay and then so whenever we shift to

843
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,880
i'm looking at how much data that they

844
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,960
claim that they will be posting to their

845
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,440
site from the claimed exfiltration to

846
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,880
how much data actually appears on the

847
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,520
site you can see on the graph on the

848
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,520
left there just how large that shift is

849
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,200
where groups like black matter are

850
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,880
claiming that they have seven terabytes

851
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,120
of information posted to their site

852
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,320
whenever you actually go through the

853
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,480
information there's only about 760

854
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,360
gigabytes on there

855
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,080
this does get to show with defray

856
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,320
over on the left

857
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,919
what they claim is what they've actually

858
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:48,000
ex-filled so that is a great tool for

859
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,760
our incident response team once the

860
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,520
initial post comes up and they claim

861
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,880
that they have

862
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,200
400 gigs of data we can tell the ir team

863
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,799
you're looking for 400 gigs of

864
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:01,720
exfiltration somewhere on this network

865
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,000
then if you actually see with the hive

866
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,559
one two

867
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,240
they have very large claims on their

868
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,679
website where some of the groups they

869
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:13,840
were claiming that they had about 300 to

870
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,880
500 gigs posted onto the site

871
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,640
but whenever we looked at the actual

872
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,559
data available it was only about half a

873
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,080
percent

874
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,159
of their claims so there's very little

875
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,399
data available on the site versus what

876
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:30,600
they claim to have ex filled

877
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:33,679
oh

878
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:35,440
it's just the forward button

879
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,840
back one works fine

880
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,440
um so breaking down where the groups are

881
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,519
hosting these sites uh you can see on

882
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,519
the left with the asterisks those are

883
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,120
the actual third party providers i'd

884
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,600
mentioned that will cooperate and may

885
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,200
actually remove that data from their

886
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,720
site once they notice that it is live

887
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,880
and then if

888
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,559
with the different groups you'll see

889
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,960
them have different file servers so

890
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,039
whether that be it's a section of their

891
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,080
website

892
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,760
that is actually hosting the downloads

893
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,559
or a separate tour apache server

894
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,399
what we noticed with the tour hosted

895
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,080
whether it be the apache or on their

896
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,159
actual site was those were the groups

897
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:14,559
that had the 100 uptime

898
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,799
and very large amounts of data

899
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,039
compared to your groups like hive would

900
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:22,720
use sites like mega and the private lab

901
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,320
and only post

902
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,240
maybe a handful of the data that they

903
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,640
claimed and then compared to the actual

904
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,840
other groups where there's several

905
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,559
hundred gigs

906
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:35,679
there we go

907
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,360
so this is kind of a breakdown of just

908
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,039
all the statistics kind of rolled into

909
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,399
one

910
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:44,559
can i take that off to turn around

911
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,840
there we go

912
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,519
um so yeah whenever we look at the

913
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:48,799
different groups

914
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:51,279
um like you can see with defray vice

915
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:53,679
society and zing locker if you made it

916
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,519
onto their site you have a hundred

917
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,039
percent chance of that data actually

918
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,240
appearing

919
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,960
compared to looking at like some someone

920
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,640
like black matter

921
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,559
you only have about a 50 chance of that

922
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,279
data appearing

923
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:08,880
then one of the things that we really

924
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,039
notice with hive was that out of their

925
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:15,200
25 victims roughly 70 had data posted

926
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,960
but the total data that was actually

927
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,799
posted on the site was only

928
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,559
two gigs

929
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,960
so out of the around 20 victims that had

930
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,799
data posted that only amounted to 2

931
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,960
gigabytes of data which is very very

932
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,080
little for the around 20 victims

933
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,039
compared to with black matter with 26

934
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:37,000
victims we saw about 760.

935
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,159
um let's see

936
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,159
yeah so just kind of overview of the

937
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,720
different stats um black matter roughly

938
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,120
ten percent of their claim data that was

939
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,200
x field actually gets posted and that

940
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,279
did line up with what we saw with

941
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,240
different black matter cases as far as

942
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,279
their ex-focus and then looking to the

943
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:59,200
previous dark side cases we had before

944
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,279
they're shut down

945
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,799
one of the just really cool kind of

946
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:05,039
stats we saw with that was the victims

947
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,960
with data posted for black matter was

948
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,879
rated around 50 percent

949
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:12,079
that was exactly the same for dark side

950
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,719
so just kind of just a odd ttp

951
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,079
doesn't necessarily mean the groups are

952
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,719
related but just goes on to pile on with

953
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,000
the rest of the information on the

954
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,399
groups

955
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,839
and then like i said with defray

956
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:28,480
vice society and zing locker who use the

957
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,960
tor hosted sites if that data does

958
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,119
appear on the site it's going to stay on

959
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,239
the site compared to with revo using the

960
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,399
third party sites where most of the time

961
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:40,079
they're getting taken offline or the

962
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,000
links are actually expiring before the

963
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,359
data is even up for too long

964
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,760
and then just like with any threat

965
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,679
actors that we deal with

966
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,280
i thought it was going to stay

967
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,560
like with any of the threat actors we

968
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,199
deal with even if you do pay this ransom

969
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,280
or your data does not appear onto the

970
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,920
sites there's no really telling where

971
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,400
that data is who has access where it has

972
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,400
been published online

973
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,240
so this was from

974
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,839
one of the chats that we had with one of

975
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,000
the threat actors after they had given

976
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,280
us data that a victim had paid for to

977
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,760
have unlocked

978
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,119
so of course we could easily have

979
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:20,400
backups but we assure you we do not now

980
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,800
they've kind of been joking manner

981
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,119
whenever we showed the client

982
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:27,440
these logs they were not too happy about

983
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,880
that with the

984
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,119
actor kind of making a joke that they

985
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:32,880
still had their data backed up

986
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,640
and the lawyers were kind of iffy about

987
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,040
that going forwards

988
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:41,040
but as far as the larger groups go

989
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,320
i don't want to say that they're

990
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,720
trustworthy but they do kind of like to

991
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,119
keep their reputation in line

992
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:50,240
so say a large group like black matter

993
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,320
a victim pays to have their data removed

994
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,760
and that data is spread across the

995
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,359
entire internet

996
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:57,040
the next victim that comes along with

997
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,200
black matter is likely not to pay

998
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,119
because even if they do pay their data

999
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,800
still may get posted somewhere online

1000
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,880
well i work for the last one

1001
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,040
yes sir

1002
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,839
so obviously the you know best uh

1003
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,200
you know cure for ransomware is

1004
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,599
prevention um because these actors are

1005
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,359
obviously very opportunistic they're

1006
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,040
taking advantage of everything they can

1007
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,440
do to get into networks um they're also

1008
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,040
you know taking advantage of security

1009
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,200
vulnerabilities that they observe

1010
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,800
um so the biggest you know way to stop

1011
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,320
ransomware attack is to prevent it from

1012
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,800
actually happening um so these are just

1013
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,480
some you know controls that we've

1014
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,040
observed in kroll as far as you know

1015
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,880
things that people should probably be

1016
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,880
doing to have you know increased cyber

1017
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,040
resiliency i guess they would say

1018
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,760
multi-factor authentication um the

1019
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,079
majority unfortunately of our of the

1020
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,160
ransomware cases that we see the

1021
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,839
majority of those people do not have

1022
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,079
multi-factor authentication across the

1023
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:59,680
board maybe they have it at like a part

1024
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,920
of their organization but that seems to

1025
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,560
be a huge factor for these groups

1026
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,359
obviously they go after a vpn so

1027
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:10,079
vulnerable vpns if there is a patch to a

1028
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,320
vpn appliance that you're using you

1029
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,560
should definitely be updating that

1030
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,280
because we do see those actors uh you

1031
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,359
know trying to exploit those

1032
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:21,520
open rdp that is another one that they

1033
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,359
will try to exploit

1034
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:25,359
we recommend everyone have some kind of

1035
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:27,520
endpoint detection monitoring to like

1036
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,440
catch some of this like precursor

1037
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,280
malware before it actually goes to a

1038
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,839
full ransomware attack um and then we

1039
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:35,359
also suggest that everyone you know have

1040
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:37,760
some kind of a plan uh in the event that

1041
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,440
this does happen do you want to talk

1042
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,119
about the other ones

1043
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:43,920
yes there's some of them

1044
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,079
well just a few different things to go

1045
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,160
along with those

1046
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,640
in case of an attack does happen

1047
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,760
you need to go through your different

1048
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,320
backups kind of have plans

1049
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,160
have different training into restoring

1050
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,560
from the backups

1051
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,240
so whenever these ransomware groups come

1052
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,400
in they may get into your network

1053
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,040
encrypt your backups delete the backups

1054
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,359
or just kind of lock you out from those

1055
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:09,920
so having

1056
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,280
it's just me whenever i stand up here

1057
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,720
so having just a different kind of

1058
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,280
awareness and ability to go through that

1059
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,960
can definitely save you a lot of money

1060
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,920
and time recovering from those

1061
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,240
well your access controls constantly

1062
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,160
reviewing constantly updating and

1063
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,920
managing those

1064
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,040
compared to

1065
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,040
what you see in a few different cases

1066
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,640
where an actor gets onto a network

1067
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,280
whether they create an account

1068
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,599
escalate privileges onto a account that

1069
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:39,599
was already created

1070
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:41,359
companies not knowing about that that

1071
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:42,800
actor might be on your network for

1072
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,079
several months to several years

1073
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,680
then with your email hygiene and

1074
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,079
security culture

1075
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:51,680
your number one threat is always going

1076
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,920
to be the end user at their desk

1077
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,520
so kind of just constantly promoting

1078
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,560
with those

1079
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,880
letting your

1080
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,480
different coworkers know what is going

1081
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,720
on with the landscape what is popular

1082
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,960
right now and then having the actual

1083
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,160
controls

1084
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,320
built in to back that up so whether that

1085
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,160
be an outlook with the reporting

1086
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,440
phishing button

1087
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,359
whether that be the tagging all external

1088
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:15,760
emails in outlook or even just going

1089
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,920
through and teaching your employees

1090
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,680
here's what not to do if you believe

1091
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,960
that you received a phishing email

1092
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,480
and then i just want to touch on like

1093
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,599
lori said

1094
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:28,880
with the multi-factor and vpns so even

1095
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,560
if you have those implemented we have

1096
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,800
seen many cases where those are bypassed

1097
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,920
just due to them either being

1098
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,119
implemented poorly or improperly or not

1099
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:38,320
patched

1100
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,720
one of the largest ones that we see

1101
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,760
was a 2018 vpn vulnerability where

1102
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,359
actors have gone out and scraped these

1103
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:47,599
credentials and posted them all online

1104
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,359
and this has been out for three years

1105
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,839
and we're still seeing companies come in

1106
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:53,359
that are still vulnerable to this and

1107
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:55,200
still have the exact plaintext creds

1108
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,640
that were leaked for their vpns

1109
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,720
and then infrastructure and segmentation

1110
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,400
kind of limiting just how the threat

1111
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,480
actors can jump around your network and

1112
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,800
separating those whether this be they

1113
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,599
get into a marketing computer versus one

1114
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:12,000
of your sales people's computers

1115
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,680
and then getting into being able to

1116
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,760
spread across the entire network

1117
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,359
so having the different monitoring

1118
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:19,200
across the endpoints

1119
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,200
and then being able to actually identify

1120
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,599
and stop this kind of attacks are

1121
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:25,200
critical to you just

1122
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,119
not having your company be shut down for

1123
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,359
would be two weeks to four weeks during

1124
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:32,640
the entire attack

1125
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,319
anything else gonna go with that

1126
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:39,839
does anybody have any questions for us

1127
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:43,760
[Music]

1128
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,920
is everybody ready to go for lunch

1129
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,280
we can see the boxes back there all

1130
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,680
stacked up

1131
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,180
awesome thank you everybody

1132
00:40:56,180 --> 00:41:01,190
[Applause]
