i'm going to turn it over to the main

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,839
people that run all of this insanity

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,559
that was besides pittsburgh but well

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:11,120
it's still besides pittsburgh until

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,120
another hour so nowhere to be okay yeah

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,800
so anyway

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,680
please welcome to the stage

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,359
all the important people i don't know

9
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,080
that would include you

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,840

you think we can do one um

16
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,399
this summer coming up already

17
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,879
think you can talk to your your vendors

18
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,879
who sponsor and convince them to do this

19
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,680
again this quick

20
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,199
doesn't sound very convincing all right

21
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,600
we'll think about that

22
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,800
all right uh

23
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,640
anyway thanks for uh showing up here

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,600
awkwardly stand on the stage holding

43
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,200

no that's what we have cat for to tell

47
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,439
jokes and my joke i told her earlier to

48
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,960
tell was so bad that i don't think you

49
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,399
used it did you

50
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,640
oh did they oh good we won't do that

51
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,920
again

52
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,040
oh

53
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,439
yeah it was uh you can if you take a

54
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,479
bear and you give the bear uh socks and

55
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,959
shoes they still have bare feet

56
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,760
but see it was funnier it's funny when

57
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,319
cat tells it

58
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:16,959
all right i don't have any jokes eric

59
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,319
you have any jokes

60
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,319
no dan jokes

61
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,160
who's got a joke a clean joke

62
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,359
that probably caught most you out

63
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,720
now you know how hard it is

64
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,519
yeah yeah or do we just get you in them

65
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:44,959
with a picture and we'll post on social

66
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,400
media

67
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,160
all right cool

68
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,400
all right

69
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,840
do you have any second or third places

70
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,680
to announce or anything nope okay

71
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,760
yep yeah so the ctf went really well we

72
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,840
had about 30 people participate in the

73
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,080
ctf um this year and uh

74
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,800
a lot of people solved at least one uh

75
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,120
challenge and the winners i believe that

76
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,480
they get four

77
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,560
um yeah four they solved four of the

78
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,840
challenges and we're pretty close on a

79
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,239
few other ones um just little little

80
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,800
gotchas that hung them up but yeah um so

81
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,280
they they took first place with four it

82
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,599
was a team of two

83
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,840
um

84
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,280
what were some of the challenges dan

85
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,239
would you like to talk about someone's

86
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,080
sounds like i could talk about some of

87
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,000
the challenges you developed but i feel

88
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,200
like you should do the honors

89
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,000
uh so it was a pretty open network with

90
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,159
a bunch of vulnerable services running

91
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,080
uh we used the recent oh my god

92
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,440
vulnerability in omi um that was used to

93
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,720
basically take over a lot of stuff in

94
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,840
azure

95
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,480
however you say that microsoft stuff

96
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,519
um

97
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:56,720
let's see there's the confluence

98
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,159
vulnerability that was big back in

99
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,239
august we put that in there the recent

100
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,000
apache thing that everybody got pretty

101
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,840
worked up about

102
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,439
had that in there

103
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,360
there was a wi-fi challenge

104
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,680
so figuring out which wi-fi

105
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,400
access or ssid was vulnerable and

106
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,000
getting into the wi-fi router which was

107
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,519
running on like some

108
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,600
cheap uh imported

109
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,320
you know router from amazon that i got

110
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,918
uh

111
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,520
the chat oh yeah there's a rocket chat

112
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,880
which was kind of fun because we were

113
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,320
chatting with each other as the people

114
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,919
were trying to find the vulnerability in

115
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,840
the chat software to get in

116
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,759
so that was cool there was a container

117
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,400
escape because containers are the thing

118
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,400
so i figure we should pay attention to

119
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,199
that

120
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,400
see cat nodding up here

121
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,639
yeah malware i wrote some really bad

122
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,800
malware in python um so people had to

123
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,639
reverse engineer that and it gave you up

124
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,199
the uh credentials for the cnc channel

125
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,280
um so you could use that to kind of walk

126
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,400
back into the server

127
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,360
um

128
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,199
what's that

129
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,320
which one

130
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,639
oh yeah and of course john put one in

131
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,560
there uh where you just had to view

132
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,880
source to get the flag as a little shout

133
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,880
out to our favorite governor in missouri

134
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,320
few sources not a crime people

135
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,280
uh so i think that's it probably yeah

136
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,280
yep so it was a lot of fun hopefully

137
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,800
people had fun playing and we'll do it

138
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,560
again next time in

139
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,479
this coming summer

140
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,800
oh one thing i don't think that anybody

141
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,320
mentioned this earlier i didn't hear it

142
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,080
but did you all know that today's

143
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,680
b-sides pittsburgh is the 700th b-sides

144
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,840
across the world i think that's pretty

145
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,400
cool 154 countries every continent

146
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,800
except antarctica

147
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,840
so we've

148
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,600
come a long way i think that's pretty

149
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,880
awesome

150
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,720
thanks guys very cool

151
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,840
all right well thanks everybody for

152
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,840

154
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,680
