1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,720
hi everybody can everybody hear me all

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,120
the way to the back with this mic

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,920
cool i see some thumbs up awesome

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,799
so my name is rose and i am going to be

5
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:17,279
speaking on grc a swiss army knife

6
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,600
this talk is one that i've been mulling

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,640
over doing for years

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,480
grc is super

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,880
near and dear to my heart

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,439
it just makes me insanely happy to do

11
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,760
anything grc related and kind of send

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,239
the information out into the world so

13
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:35,760
we're going to talk about this topic i

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,000
promise i didn't make it boring

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,840
grc is super interesting especially if

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,120
you work in it

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,280
this talk is meant to be very generic so

18
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,960
if you have other departments in your

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,200
organization that are struggling working

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,199
with other business units a lot of the

21
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,520
information that i talk today can be

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,840
universally applied so

23
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,320
take these takeaways and go apply them

24
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,640
within your organization

25
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,520
so i picked a swiss army knife as the

26
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,240
the concept of this talk because a swiss

27
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,200
army knife is so multi-faceted

28
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,360
you use it to screw you have a knife you

29
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,960
have clippers you can pretty much make

30
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,280
it whatever you need to be so

31
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,920
use this concept in order to talk about

32
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,200
grc

33
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,680
and hopefully it resonates with you guys

34
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,119
well before we get into the good parts

35
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,759
of this presentation um a little bit

36
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,680
about me so

37
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,640
i am the director of it and compliance

38
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,439
at spring health spring health is a

39
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,360
mental health company that specializes

40
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,680
in data and analytics to bring really

41
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,320
good care to patients so taking away

42
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,640
from doing kind of like hitting the

43
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,399
darts on the wall approach to mental

44
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,840
health but rather using data and

45
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,759
analytics to provide really good care to

46
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,200
our patients

47
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,119
as you can imagine we have a pretty

48
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,040
robust platform and lots of security

49
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,600
things that need to happen on that

50
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,960
before i came to spring i was a

51
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,520
consultant for years at cso i see some

52
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,840
of my cso friends in the crowd so hi

53
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,520
ciso

54
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,758

[Laughter]

59
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,640
and before that i was in the military

60
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,800
for quite a bit of time eight years and

61
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,120
i did network engineering i did it i

62
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,520
worked on crypto gear you name it i was

63
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,959
doing it and so

64
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,720
my background gives me a whole lot of

65
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,560
like different things to pull from when

66
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,160
i'm trying to build really good business

67
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,720
relationships and i think fix the things

68
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,920
that i'm trying to fix within my

69
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,760
organization

70
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,840
additionally i have some education you

71
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,440
guys can see it up there

72
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,440
more importantly i like to volunteer in

73
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,599
the community i do lots of mentoring

74
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,760
with women in cyber security

75
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,800
lots of work with giving back to the

76
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,959
infosec community such as speaking and

77
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,879
then additionally i run the diversity

78
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,040
and tech group at my organization trying

79
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,000
to bring

80
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,560
more diverse folks into our technology

81
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,560
department which includes engineering

82
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,560
security and whatnot so

83
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,800
enough about me you guys didn't come to

84
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,319
this presentation to learn about rose

85
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,319
you came to learn about grc

86
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,800
so we will get into our topics

87
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,360
today we are going to level set on what

88
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,159
exactly is grc i've mentioned that tons

89
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,800
of times now and haven't quite gone over

90
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,480
what that really means to everybody so

91
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,959
we'll level set on grc what we normally

92
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,040
do in this department we'll talk about

93
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,920
the challenges of grc so these

94
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,519
challenges are ultra important when

95
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,599
you're trying to figure out how to fix

96
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,120
your department how to make it more

97
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,239
efficient how to enable the business

98
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,239
then we'll talk about relationships in

99
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:41,680
the organization

100
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,799
so

101
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,959
anytime that we're working with anybody

102
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,480
in the business we need to understand

103
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,239
the dynamics of those relationships in

104
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,760
order to

105
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,440
maybe fix the things that are going on

106
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,040
ask for help whatever we need so we're

107
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,720
going to talk about relationships and

108
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,159
then we're going to get into the pronged

109
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,200
approach so what do i mean by the swiss

110
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,799
army knife and we'll break it down by

111
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,799
some different prongs and we'll have

112
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,879
some takeaways the goal of this

113
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,640
presentation is that you can go back to

114
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,000
your organization

115
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,959
and implement some of these tidbits and

116
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,799
try to improve the quality of life when

117
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,319
working with grc working with the

118
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,719
business

119
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,839
governance risk and compliance that is

120
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,918
what grc stands for a lot of

121
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,560
organizations have a grc department

122
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,919
maybe it's called security and

123
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,479
compliance maybe just compliance but

124
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,800
ultimately it is a governance risk and

125
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,360
compliance type functionality so we have

126
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,960
three pillars that are happening within

127
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,280
this department we have governance which

128
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,160
is

129
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,160
where you're aligning processes and

130
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,720
actions you're developing documentation

131
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,040
policies procedures standards that are

132
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,880
generally governing the things that need

133
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,120
to happen within the organization

134
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,520
then you have risk management so risk

135
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,560
management

136
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,639
includes risks that you may be fined on

137
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,199
your platforms in the environment

138
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,440
processes but it also includes vendor

139
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,520
risk management so how are you managing

140
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,840
the lifecycle of those vendors

141
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,280
additionally you can also lump in client

142
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,600
questionnaires into the risk management

143
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,400
area

144
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,199
i know i refer to this program as client

145
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,840
assurance and security so

146
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,160
anytime you have a client sending you a

147
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,880
questionnaire asking about documentation

148
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,600
asking for artifacts whatever it may be

149
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,240
then we have compliance

150
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,639
so compliance is how we are complying

151
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,520
with the legal regulatory landscape of

152
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,000
our particular business so i'll give the

153
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,560
example of spring health spring health

154
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,039
is a mental health company so

155
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,560
hipaa is

156
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,720
applicable to us the hipaa privacy rule

157
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,280
security rule breach notification so

158
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,520
compliance team is responsible for

159
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,520
understanding consuming and ensuring

160
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,199
that we are complying with that

161
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,240
additionally we have eu citizens so gdpr

162
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,800
becomes in scope for our compliance team

163
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,880
and we have consumers out in california

164
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,560
for ccpa

165
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,120
so these three pillars make up the

166
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,479
governance risk and compliance

167
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,680
department and as you guys likely know

168
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,720
it's

169
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,400
very large the activities that need to

170
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,479
happen in this department and we touch

171
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,000
every single

172
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,840
business unit in order to be able to

173
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,000
fulfill these things that we need to do

174
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,080
each of these pillars have their own

175
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,720
nuanced processes that need to happen

176
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,639
and they're ran by a team that's

177
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,800
normally relatively small

178
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,960
i'm fortunate enough to have four people

179
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,800
plus myself at spring health for a

180
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,280
compliance department but in the past

181
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,440
maybe it was just me running it or maybe

182
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,319
we had to get staff og and so it becomes

183
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,160
very consuming to try to get all of

184
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,120
these things in place

185
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,280
now since we level set on

186
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,759
challenges or what the pillars are let's

187
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,680
talk about the challenges so

188
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,599
before you even get to the point that

189
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,680
you can start enabling the business to

190
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,360
work better

191
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,560
work faster and to be less of a blocker

192
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,160
you have to understand the challenges

193
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,400
and so i give some examples up on the

194
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,520
screen

195
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,199
please make sure that you go back to

196
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,680
your own organization and you observe

197
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,599
what the challenges are within your

198
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,520
organization because that is ultimately

199
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,639
how you'll

200
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,919
identify what are the things that you

201
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,680
need to solve and so

202
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,840
some of the challenges that are listed

203
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,479
here is we have

204
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,800
where a compliance department may only

205
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,560
be focused on the

206
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,880
regulatory landscape

207
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,919
for this

208
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,360
if you are only focused on the

209
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,759
regulatory landscape your department

210
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,560
will turn into a check box activity and

211
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,120
that checkbox activity ultimately

212
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,759
influences how other departments see you

213
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,520
well compliance is asking us to do

214
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,280
security awareness again let me just get

215
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,759
it done let me just check off the box

216
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,360
that's not what we want happening we

217
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,120
want to have really good partnerships

218
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,319
with the business so you want to get

219
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,639
away from focusing on just the

220
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,199
regulatory things and focus on how do i

221
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,479
enable the business to work better

222
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,319
additionally cross-functional

223
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,479
collaboration tends to be difficult when

224
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,199
you are working in grc so

225
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,039
we'll talk about some tips and tricks to

226
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,039
improve that

227
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,479
as you guys likely know while grc has

228
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,319
some of the processes that we have to

229
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,240
implement in order to satisfy legal

230
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,560
regulatory things

231
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,240
a lot of times we have to rely on our

232
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,240
counterparts outside of these groups

233
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,479
like engineering product

234
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,280
maybe even people operations or hr and

235
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,080
so

236
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,440
achieving the point where you have

237
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,240
really good cross collaboration can be

238
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,760
challenging and so you have to figure

239
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,479
out how do i make this happen

240
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,240
uh the biggest challenge that i've also

241
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,599
seen is being reactive versus proactive

242
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,760
so if your compliance department is in a

243
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,600
perpetual state of like

244
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,880
all right we got to get this done we got

245
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,399
to get this done well

246
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,120
now you are creating undue burden to

247
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,200
other teams that then need to hit those

248
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,959
items and so

249
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,399
you need to get to the point where

250
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,399
you're being proactive

251
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,360
can you put a schedule out can you have

252
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,880
notifications

253
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,200
well in advance and reminders and sort

254
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,560
of things like that where you become

255
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,040
more proactive

256
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,720
then there is a lack of alignment

257
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,680
between the business and grc so

258
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,600
the business in grc we have to be

259
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,440
speaking the same language if not we're

260
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,200
always going to be butting heads right

261
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,600
so the alignment needs to happen there

262
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,839
and it needs to happen in a way where we

263
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,760
are enabling the business

264
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,320
to work faster harder stronger and not

265
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,880
blocking them and it's challenging if

266
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,800
you work in grc you already know it's a

267
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,200
very challenging aspect obviously why

268
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,360
it's listed here on grc challenges

269
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,000
and then another challenge is too many

270
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,800
manual processes so

271
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,080
we are just now getting to the point

272
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,760
where we can start automating within the

273
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,240
governance risk compliance space

274
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,920
we're getting tools that allow us to

275
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,160
automate vendor reviews um access

276
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,240
reviews maybe even stock to controls

277
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,000
like tools like drata and i think vanta

278
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
is another one so we're finally getting

279
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,839
to the point that we can move away from

280
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,519
manual processes but the manual

281
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,920
processes they cause a lot of overhead

282
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,680
they become really clunky and they're

283
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,000
hard for people to understand what they

284
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,040
actually need to do at the organization

285
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,120
this all creates all these different

286
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,079
challenges within this department

287
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,000
additionally what i have not included on

288
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,560
here are some things that i personally

289
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,279
do to kind of track challenges within my

290
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,200
own organization so

291
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,279
um if you guys maybe don't know what

292
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,200
those are yet you're trying to figure it

293
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,079
out

294
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,480
i do it a couple different ways i

295
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,880
observe so if

296
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,600
i we use slack so if i'm in slack and

297
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,200
i'm starting to see people like oh this

298
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,160
process is so long or they're fussing

299
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,440
okay well that's starting to give me

300
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,040
indicators that people maybe need

301
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,160
training they need support whatever

302
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,760
i talk to my team

303
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,320
both in a public forum and private so

304
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,640
one-on-ones guys what are the challenges

305
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,880
that you guys are seeing are you having

306
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,399
issues with working with different parts

307
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,160
of the department because that tells me

308
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,399
as a leader i need to go partner with my

309
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,040
peers and figure out a good approach to

310
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,519
ironing out these issues and then in the

311
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,600
public forum when we meet as a team i

312
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,040
like to ask because it creates a

313
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,800
collaborative nature where we can

314
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,800
partner together as a group and figure

315
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,399
out the best approach to solving these

316
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,360
challenges that we face

317
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,880
with challenges that

318
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,440
kind of gives you an ineffective grc

319
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,680
program so when you have an effective

320
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,320
grc program that becomes very noticeable

321
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,160
to the business it becomes noticeable

322
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,440
when they're trying to push a product to

323
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,600
go live and we can't let them because

324
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,360
they found out about a risk the day

325
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,279
before they were trying to go live

326
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,720
it's ineffective when people are trying

327
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,560
to onboard a vendor and it's taking them

328
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,760
a month and a half to even get them

329
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,079
through the vendor review and we want to

330
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,079
reduce these things we don't want the

331
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,160
business to be slowed down again the

332
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,680
whole point of this conversation is that

333
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,440
we're enabling the business we're

334
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,360
enabling them and being a good partner

335
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,800
and we can't do that if we have an

336
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,399
effective program

337
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,279
so

338
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,680
ineffective program you may have

339
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,399
unnecessary program complexity

340
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,200
maybe you have a vendor risk management

341
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,079
program that has 20 steps when maybe it

342
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,519
only needs six

343
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,920
so it really takes

344
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,720
looking at your program evaluating what

345
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,040
you're actually doing and figuring out

346
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,639
what are these things that i can get rid

347
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,880
of that makes my program super clunky

348
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,760
and hard to understand

349
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,079
unknown service level agreements

350
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,639
for processes this is a big one and a

351
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,240
lot of frustrations when working with

352
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,440
compliance

353
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,560
if someone comes to me and they say hey

354
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,639
compliance team we need you to fill out

355
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,120
a client questionnaire and it is 60

356
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,519
questions i should be able to tell them

357
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,639
immediately all right a 60 question

358
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,480
questionnaire is going to take me three

359
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,160
days and i've done that because i've

360
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,320
done that data and analytics on the back

361
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,480
end to know how long does it normally

362
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,920
take my team

363
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,160
i know when we do a vendor review it's

364
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,120
going to take at a maximum three weeks

365
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,040
because we've done the data in

366
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,959
analytics in the back end and so when

367
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,880
you're talking with the business they

368
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,839
need to under the understand the slas if

369
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,800
they're trying to roll out a project

370
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,519
or a new product they should know all

371
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,600
right i need three weeks of compliance

372
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,000
time built into this project plan and so

373
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,079
now you start to reduce the frustrations

374
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,160
when they're working with us

375
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,160
but if you don't have that information

376
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,079
and haven't planned for it it gives the

377
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,000
illusion that the team isn't operating

378
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,720
effectively it can create headaches when

379
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,279
working with us so highly recommend you

380
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,839
understand your slas for these processes

381
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,399
that interface with the business

382
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,519
lack of visibility into risk

383
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,519
all day long we deal with risk right

384
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,839
regardless if you work in grc or you

385
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,000
work in security and so

386
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,920
when you have an ineffective program

387
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,040
happening you're getting lack of

388
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,680
visibility into risk i want the business

389
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,440
to come to me every time they identify

390
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,959
something that may be a risk they

391
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,880
self-identified i want them to come to

392
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,120
me but if we have a clunky program if

393
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,560
they don't feel like they can trust us

394
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,240
that we're going to take action they're

395
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,240
not going to come to us with their risk

396
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,079
and so we start to lose visibility of

397
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,639
the risk additionally

398
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,199
if they don't feel comfortable talking

399
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,360
to us they don't want to have the

400
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,600
dialogue well then

401
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,519
maybe we don't even get risk

402
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,839
treated and we have risk lingering out

403
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,120
in the environment which isn't what we

404
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,600
want either

405
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,680
additionally when we are more in a

406
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,480
reactive state you have an increased

407
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,959
budget or increased money due to

408
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,040
overhead of employees or other things

409
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,480
that you may need to do

410
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,040
so for each of my processes within

411
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,639
governance risk and compliance going

412
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,199
back to these slas i know it's going to

413
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,279
take my team three weeks to review a

414
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,519
vendor and i know throughout the year

415
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,680
we're going to have around 25 vendors

416
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,440
you start to get a sense of how many

417
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,199
hours you need for your team throughout

418
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,160
the year you can capacity plan but if

419
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,839
you don't have that and you turn into a

420
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,399
more of a reactive nature then you have

421
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,560
you ultimately end up spending more

422
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,720
money on things that you didn't plan for

423
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,800
and so again it's ineffective program

424
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,240
happening

425
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,360
and then the final one an ineffective

426
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,880
grc program is your grc team lacks the

427
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,480
technology knowledge

428
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,839
technology knowledge in order to be able

429
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,839
to talk with the business

430
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,160
how can i tell you how to secure

431
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,320
something or implement a control if i

432
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,560
have no idea about the technologies

433
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,839
so um when you have an ineffective team

434
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,839
they can't go to the business and say

435
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,519
hey business i need you to implement

436
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,959
mobile device management and these are

437
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,720
the things they need you to do they

438
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,040
don't understand the technologies so if

439
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,360
your team is working

440
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,360
i highly recommend that they understand

441
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,040
their platform they understand how the

442
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,880
data flows in and out they understand

443
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,320
all these different technologies because

444
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,160
it truly does make an impact in how

445
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,519
you're conversing with the business

446
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,680
so so far we've talked about the grc

447
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,959
pillars we've talked about some

448
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,360
challenges and inefficiencies

449
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,560
i want to touch on relationships so this

450
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,279
is a quick snapshot and definitely not

451
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,279
all-encompassing

452
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,279
the relationships that you have in the

453
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,560
org

454
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,519
grc and security touch every single

455
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,000
department some may be more high touch

456
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,920
than others but you touch every single

457
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,320
department and so it's really critical

458
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,320
that you are truly building rapport with

459
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,680
these people in the department because

460
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,959
ultimately you're trying to get them to

461
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,880
implement or do something that you need

462
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,440
them to do right so you want to have

463
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,959
relationships with these different

464
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,720
groups whether it's product and making

465
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,240
sure that you get integrated into their

466
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,920
life cycle before they push something

467
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,920
out whether it's engineering to make

468
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,079
sure that repos aren't in a public area

469
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,240
where other people can access it

470
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,199
two

471
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,120
maybe your hr or people operations

472
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,880
functions to make sure background checks

473
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,399
are happening and making sure they're

474
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,720
getting their questions answered about

475
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,199
background checks or other processes

476
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,160
so

477
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,759
really focus on these different

478
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,360
relationships that you need to have and

479
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,839
focus on how your processes go into

480
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:10,319
these different areas so if i know that

481
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,000
people operations are going to touch

482
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,160
background checks they should know that

483
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,000
they're responsible over those different

484
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,319
areas the same way engineering should

485
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,400
know that they're responsible for

486
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,959
maintaining repos in a certain way

487
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,880
so it's super critical you understand

488
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,280
your relationships and you build rapport

489
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,799
with each of these groups and you

490
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,880
understand the pains and frustrations

491
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,440
that they go through in their own areas

492
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,520
because they're all humans right we want

493
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,200
to make sure that we're treating them

494
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,039
with respect we're not just demanding

495
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,960
them to do things and sometimes that

496
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,720
gets away from us when we're working in

497
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,320
compliance when there's so many things

498
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,760
that we have to ensure the business is

499
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,440
doing in order to keep you know data

500
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,480
safe and secure right

501
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,880
all right so we talked all these

502
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,960
different areas of grc and we haven't

503
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,960
actually talked about a swiss army knife

504
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,640
yet even though it is in the title of

505
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,080
this presentation

506
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:04,880
um

507
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,440
so what i have here is a pronged

508
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,880
approach to

509
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,679
grc so i'm going to tell you some of the

510
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,200
things that have worked really well in

511
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,080
my life with grc whether i learned it

512
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,760
from the military i learned it from

513
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,440
consulting being an individual

514
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,520
contributor or now in a leadership

515
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,720
position

516
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,120
so we have these prongs up here i picked

517
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,480
five

518
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,640
you know your own grc for your

519
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,240
organization maybe you have six prongs

520
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,559
maybe you have seven maybe you have two

521
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,280
um it really depends on what you are

522
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,400
trying to accomplish for your

523
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,400
organization so again this is meant just

524
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,080
to kind of get you going

525
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,480
um i love this concept of the grc knife

526
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,240
because it truly can be anything that

527
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,559
you want it to be whenever i was uh

528
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,360
getting ready for this presentation

529
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,360
i definitely don't know a lot about grc

530
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,360
or not grc swiss army knife so maybe i

531
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,520
shouldn't have gone with that but i was

532
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,520
truly shocked at all of the different

533
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,440
swiss army knives out there they're pink

534
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,360
they're red they have all these

535
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,120
different different functionalities on

536
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,520
them and they truly can be anything that

537
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,840
you want them to be so when you're

538
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,160
thinking about how to make your program

539
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,679
more effective

540
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,360
think of all these different ways that

541
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,039
you can approach it don't think of it

542
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,120
just like all right this is my area i'm

543
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,640
only going to focus on these compliance

544
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,520
controls think outside of the box think

545
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,600
how can i partner with the business what

546
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,520
do they need to be successful how can i

547
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,440
enable them to do the things that i

548
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,520
ultimately need them to do

549
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,440
so we'll have these different prongs in

550
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,360
order to be able to support them

551
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,840
the first prong that i have up here is

552
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,360
communication

553
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,000
i cannot stress just how critical

554
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,120
communication is within the organization

555
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,360
if you do not take anything else away

556
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,880
from this talk

557
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,360
take the communication aspect and truly

558
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,080
implement it at your organization

559
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,320
when we have things that need to get

560
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,240
accomplished and maybe where there's

561
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,880
misalignment communication is often the

562
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,440
root cause of why we're having issues in

563
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,080
the organization why we're butting heads

564
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,159
why there's frustrations and so take a

565
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,520
good look at the communication that's

566
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,760
happening within your org

567
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,400
advocating so

568
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,159
you should advocate for your business

569
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,400
partners for the work that they need to

570
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,640
get done we shouldn't be bullying them

571
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,880
into the work but rather advocating and

572
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,559
lifting them up

573
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,480
we're going to talk about training

574
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,080
we're going to talk about enabling the

575
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,440
business so what are some of the

576
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,360
different things that we can do outside

577
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,520
of these other prongs that enable our

578
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,840
department to function better then we'll

579
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,000
talk about automation so

580
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,320
how do we remove those manual processes

581
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,360
that create inefficiencies and automate

582
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,799
the processes where possible

583
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,080
so for uh communication

584
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,960
i

585
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,360
thought it was important to cover um a

586
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,120
couple different aspects here so we're

587
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,559
going to talk about channels of

588
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,480
communication

589
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,400
we'll talk about leaning into the

590
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,720
culture of your organization

591
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,840
so these things will ultimately help you

592
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,679
communicate more effectively with your

593
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,520
business

594
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,039
it's also really important you

595
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,039
understand the mechanisms in which your

596
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,600
business communicates so

597
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,120
in this day and age

598
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,440
i mean we all have notification fatigue

599
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,880
of all the different systems that we

600
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,880
have at our org i don't know about you

601
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,320
guys but i'm getting hundreds of

602
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,559
messages a day on a whole bunch of

603
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,320
different mechanisms

604
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,320
and it's really hard to keep track of it

605
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,159
and that's just me think about your

606
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,320
counterpart and these other groups that

607
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,000
need to be able to do the things that we

608
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,280
need them to and think about all the

609
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,360
different notifications that they get

610
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,120
out of a raise of hands do you guys get

611
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,720
a lot of notifications during the day

612
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,400
and are you probably thinking about like

613
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,240
what you have waiting for you yeah a lot

614
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,400
of heads are shaking i see you joe i

615
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,640
know joe gets a bunch

616
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,679
so

617
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,360
you guys like you have to think of your

618
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,600
counterparts and think about

619
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,440
oh man you know what if i'm getting

620
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,360
bogged down in notifications what are

621
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,679
what's happening for them and so think

622
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,840
about that as you're working with them

623
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,000
do you have a project management tool is

624
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,360
that how you should communicate should

625
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,360
it be slack should it be email how

626
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,600
should official requests happen those

627
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,760
mechanisms truly are

628
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,159
important to how you're communicating

629
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:17,679
are you using verbal or written

630
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:18,880
techniques

631
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,000
are you going to a meeting are you

632
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,600
calling people up are you huddling on

633
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,799
slack

634
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,400
what are all the different ways that you

635
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,120
communicate within your organization

636
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,159
and then consumability

637
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,240
you guys i receive a lot of emails and i

638
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,320
have no idea what that person is

639
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,960
actually asking me to do

640
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,440
we send a lot of emails that ask another

641
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,520
person to do something and they have no

642
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,159
idea what to do so when you are

643
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,159
communicating you need to communicate in

644
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,080
a way that's consumable for the person

645
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,919
that you need to take action

646
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,720
if they receive information and they

647
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,480
don't know what to do with it are they

648
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,600
actually going to take action on the

649
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,280
thing that you need them to do

650
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,720
probably not it's probably just going to

651
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,400
sit in their email and then go down to

652
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,840
the bottom of the list

653
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,679
so when you're sending out your

654
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,480
communication whatever it is it needs to

655
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,960
be in a way that is truly consumable

656
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,600
here's the information here's the ask

657
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,520
here's the due date how can i support

658
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,960
you

659
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,039
they need to know that and if they don't

660
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,720
like i said they're not going to act on

661
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,360
the things that we need them to

662
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,039
so on the next two slides we'll talk

663
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,720
about channels of communication and

664
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,039
leaning into the culture

665
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:30,240
um channels of communication recently i

666
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,880
did a fireside chat with this really

667
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,960
lovely chief product officer

668
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,120
we did it as part of our diversity in

669
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,880
tech group at spring and we targeted our

670
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,440
engineering product data science and

671
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,840
security groups because a lot of

672
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,760
communication breakdowns were happening

673
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,559
in these groups and so this chief

674
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,720
product officer she brought this really

675
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,039
great concept that i i loved on

676
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,120
different channels of communication and

677
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,159
so

678
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:59,919
up here on the screen you have these

679
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:02,559
three different channels you have upward

680
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,880
you have sideways and you have down and

681
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,679
so when you are communicating up that's

682
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,080
your c suite it's your leaders it's your

683
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,760
maybe your clients

684
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,400
they need to know the high level

685
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,200
information they don't need to know in

686
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,039
the weeds

687
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,799
this is what we're going to do

688
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,320
these are the modifications here's the

689
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,559
procedure they don't need to know that

690
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,320
the second that you start giving them

691
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,799
too much information that is when we

692
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,640
start asking more probing questions

693
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,159
you're trying to get down into the weeds

694
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,440
and that's not what you need from

695
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,600
leadership they need to know the status

696
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,559
update and if there's a huge risk or

697
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,400
something they need to take action on

698
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,000
generally you're providing them more of

699
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,320
a status update so

700
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,760
you don't want to provide them in that

701
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,600
weed's details

702
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,840
now when you're communicating more of

703
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,640
sideways those are your peers those are

704
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,600
the people that are leading departments

705
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,039
they're leading groups they're leading

706
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,919
teams and so they need to know the

707
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:01,919
information to

708
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,679
lead away from

709
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,679
risk what are the things that they're

710
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,000
doing that may be risky in their areas

711
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,760
and how can they go about fixing it

712
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,360
additionally they need to know the

713
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,080
information on things that we need them

714
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,360
to implement

715
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,520
say we are trying to go after iso 27001

716
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,240
certification my peers need to know what

717
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,159
i need from their groups in order to be

718
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,799
able to capacity plan appropriately and

719
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,640
they need to know that information in a

720
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,200
reasonable time frame

721
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,240
finally we have downward communication

722
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,200
and this is communication for our

723
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,080
individual contributors our implementers

724
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,960
contractors whoever is actually in the

725
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,880
weeds these are the people that are

726
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,440
taking the information they're taking

727
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,840
consuming it and actually applying it in

728
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,480
the environment and so they need to know

729
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,360
all the details they need to know all

730
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,039
the information in order to be able to

731
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,679
do their job effectively and it's our

732
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,600
job to make sure that they get this

733
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,919
information in these channels in these

734
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,880
ways that is appropriate for them

735
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,840
so

736
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,600
i ask you guys when you go back to your

737
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,640
organization

738
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,720
are you being mindful of your audience

739
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,640
when you're communicating are you giving

740
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,799
them the right information at the right

741
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:17,679
time

742
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,360
and are you communicating well in

743
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,200
advance for them to take the appropriate

744
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,000
actions if you can't say yes to any of

745
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,240
that you're likely having communication

746
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,480
breakdowns at your organization and it's

747
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,760
making it challenging for your

748
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,919
department to function which then in

749
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,320
turn makes it challenging for you to

750
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,919
enable the business

751
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,559
so think about that while you're going

752
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,240
forward and thinking of these challenges

753
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,000
and things that you're trying to improve

754
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,360
and making sure that you understand

755
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,640
these channels

756
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,559
and then additionally make sure your

757
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,159
team understands

758
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,400
it's not on me as a leader to only bear

759
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,799
the burden of communication it is on me

760
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,039
as a leader to ensure that i've enabled

761
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,279
my team to communicate effectively to do

762
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,279
their job and if they can't then i'm

763
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,960
giving them right training i'm teaching

764
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,159
them how to do it and we are

765
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,400
then enabling the business again through

766
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,600
making sure the team has the right

767
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,918
training

768
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,400
culture

769
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,200
so

770
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,279
we talked about

771
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,279
the communications and the methods and

772
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,279
the channels and the mechanisms and all

773
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,640
those different things

774
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,679
culture play is a really large part of

775
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,919
your organization

776
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,320
if you have communication issues

777
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,080
breakdowns whatever

778
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,760
it leads to your team being really

779
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,039
frustrated

780
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,679
as much as i want to like uh have a

781
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,320
super stellar grc program operating 100

782
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,159
of the time that just doesn't happen and

783
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,159
the amount of times that i get my team

784
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:46,000
frustrated over little things

785
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,240
it's because generally we're not being

786
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,760
mindful of the culture at the

787
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,559
organization how does the culture

788
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:55,520
operate at your org is it slack is it

789
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,279
teams do they only use email or are they

790
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,200
stuck in the stone ages where we call

791
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,480
people up because i definitely don't

792
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,640
like to call people up

793
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,679
how do you lean into that culture

794
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,320
and so i know at our organization we

795
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,120
love using slack and so if i need action

796
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,520
to happen i know i need to go to slack

797
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,520
just like my counterparts know if they

798
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,440
need action for me

799
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,200
they're hitting me up in slack yes it

800
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,039
causes tons of notifications but again

801
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,799
i'm leaning into the culture and working

802
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,960
with the culture on the best approach to

803
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,760
them

804
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,600
if you're trying to go against the

805
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,520
culture and force them into something

806
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,360
that doesn't work what you're going to

807
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,039
have is frustrations working with us

808
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,880
a lot of the times

809
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,640
people don't want to come to security

810
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,720
we're constantly in a state of making

811
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,640
sure people are aware of us making sure

812
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,039
they know to contact us and so if we're

813
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,080
forcing a tool or solution on them that

814
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,760
goes against the culture they're going

815
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,840
to be even less inclined to talk to us

816
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,440
we're already a headache

817
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,360
nobody wants to talk to us they think

818
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,559
when they talk to security they're

819
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,080
getting in trouble or they've done

820
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,600
something wrong and that's not what we

821
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,520
want at all we want to have really

822
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,840
really good relationships and we do that

823
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,679
by understanding how we communicate

824
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,520
leaning into the culture

825
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,600
maybe the culture is we like 15-minute

826
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,120
sync ups on the things that we need to

827
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,840
talk about lean into it and embrace it

828
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,360
and plan for it within your own

829
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,000
department

830
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:25,840
so before i wrap up communication

831
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,159
show hands how many of you guys feel

832
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,159
like you're having communication issues

833
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,600
at your organization now

834
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,559
yeah

835
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:37,200
it's hard communication double hands i

836
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,880
see you

837
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,039
the communication aspect really is hard

838
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,039
and i've spent a lot of my career

839
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,240
working on

840
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,840
how do i talk to

841
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,159
the other people and how do i talk to

842
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,240
them in a way that influences them to do

843
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,960
the things that i need

844
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,200
we have so many different personalities

845
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,159
that we have to work with and if we're

846
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,399
always in a state of conflict it it just

847
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:03,039
makes the communication so challenging

848
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,000
so

849
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,919
for all of you guys that have the

850
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,399
communication issues

851
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,080
really mull over

852
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,399
what's the best path and path of least

853
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,799
resistance how can i enable the business

854
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,440
by having better communication and i

855
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,360
also ask you

856
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,799
once you identify what are your

857
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,799
challenges with communication jot it

858
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,000
down

859
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,679
and implement the things that you want

860
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:26,720
to change

861
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,520
and six months from now reevaluate did

862
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,799
you get to where you were going with

863
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:34,080
your communication were you able to

864
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,840
make it better at the organization did

865
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,480
you see increa increased productivity

866
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,320
from these other teams

867
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,640
and if not tweak it

868
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,399
right we're in a constant state of

869
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:47,120
improvement so time over time look over

870
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,840
it see how you can change it and adapt

871
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,720
all right so advocating

872
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,440
when we partner with other

873
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,559
teams

874
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,039
other business units

875
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:05,200
we almost get state and

876
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,360
pushed into a state of bullying them to

877
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,840
do the things that we need so

878
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,679
um let's say we need to do system access

879
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,840
reviews i don't know about you guys but

880
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,080
system access reviews are super painful

881
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,039
we

882
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,200
have issues with system owners even

883
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,039
wanting to do them right it takes a lot

884
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:26,799
of their day no one wants to take care

885
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:29,120
of them and so you're almost bullying

886
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,120
them into doing it

887
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,240
i hate that approach it creates tensions

888
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,159
it creates frustrations

889
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,799
so when you're thinking about the things

890
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:41,600
that you need to do as an organization

891
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,960
how can you get to the point where

892
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,960
you're advocating for these teams to

893
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,679
have more bandwidth have more time to be

894
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,120
able to work on them

895
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,480
we shouldn't be in a state where we're

896
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,480
bullying them to do these things we

897
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,000
should be advocating for them and

898
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,960
helping

899
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,720
maybe they can't do system access

900
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,799
reviews because their team is at 150

901
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,880
capacity and they have not learned how

902
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,200
to articulate that to leadership

903
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,880
i can sit down with my peer and say hey

904
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,600
joe why are you not doing your system

905
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,519
reviews like what is going on how can i

906
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:14,399
help you

907
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,720
well maybe he tells me

908
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,679
i am working 80 hour weeks i literally

909
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,080
do not have time to do this i can take

910
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,679
that information back and work with

911
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,600
leadership and help him figure out how

912
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,159
do i solicit for more headcount to get

913
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:30,000
this off get these other things off my

914
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,840
plate so i can actually do these other

915
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,120
items so now you start advocating for

916
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,320
your peers and they come to trust you

917
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,240
right they don't see you as

918
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,760
oh i'm compliant so i'm coming to tell

919
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,240
you to do things but they see you as

920
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,519
someone they can trust someone that's

921
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:48,320
going to support and advocate for them

922
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,960
additionally you need to align with

923
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,399
their work

924
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:55,360
we know we know well ahead of time when

925
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,679
things need to happen during the year i

926
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,440
know in november every year i'm going to

927
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,840
do a tabletop exercise i know in january

928
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,120
i'm going to test from backups i know in

929
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,799
june i'm going to get

930
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:08,320
security training done even though

931
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,399
that's a terrible idea because everybody

932
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,640
always goes on vacation here in june you

933
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,720
know these things are happening and we

934
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,840
need to align to the business right the

935
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,159
business has the ebb and flow of things

936
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:21,519
that are going to happen

937
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,760
should we be asking everybody to do

938
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,440
security awareness

939
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,320
during the summer when people are going

940
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,039
on

941
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:31,360
vacations maybe they're traveling more

942
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,760
because of work no we should be planning

943
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,600
it for when the business is in and when

944
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,080
the business generally has a lull should

945
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,120
i be asking my organization to test from

946
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,519
backups during january when that's when

947
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,159
we have the most enrollments of patients

948
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:46,960
no

949
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,480
they need to focus on the things that

950
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,159
are coming up from enrolling new

951
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:51,679
patients

952
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,399
we need to align to their work

953
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,039
slowly rotate our compliance activities

954
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:58,960
around to when it best suits the

955
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,799
business and you'll run into less

956
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:03,039
resistance they'll be more inclined to

957
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,640
help with these things because we've

958
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,720
looked at their schedule and we've said

959
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,320
all right we know the business is doing

960
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,520
these things

961
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,480
now

962
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,280
let's plan to do it later and so now the

963
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,040
business is more appreciative they

964
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,480
understand that we're actually looking

965
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,079
out for their best interest and again

966
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,359
not bullying them to do these things

967
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,359
and then the product and business road

968
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:27,520
maps so if you are working at a company

969
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,000
that rolls out new product features all

970
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,239
the time you have to be mindful of that

971
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,760
as well that's going to

972
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,359
influence the work alignment and the

973
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:36,800
things that you need to get done and

974
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,440
more importantly it's important it's

975
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,639
important that we understand that

976
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,800
because we need to get into

977
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,079
the security

978
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:45,679
of that particular pipeline of those

979
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,440
things that are happening are they

980
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,359
rolling out a brand new feature that

981
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:51,839
could possibly affect phi or any other

982
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,599
data that we're concerned about so we

983
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,440
integrate into their sooner and then we

984
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,520
start advocating for them

985
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,440
if we get integrated sooner and we see

986
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,119
this risk pop up let's say they're

987
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,040
rolling it out in november and we find

988
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,280
this risk in february we can advocate

989
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,119
for them to get more money more budget

990
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:08,640
because we know the things that actually

991
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,079
need to get fixed

992
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:12,079
so again we're advocating for them and

993
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:16,839
ensuring this work can actually happen

994
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,280
training

995
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,280
so i do not mean security awareness

996
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,000
training with this this is training in

997
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,119
order to enable the business so

998
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,400
understanding technologies

999
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,040
grc should understand

1000
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,599
everything about our organization we

1001
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,200
should know every system every

1002
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,280
application we should know what these do

1003
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,960
we should know how the data flows

1004
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,040
through the organization especially if

1005
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,720
you need to comply with gdpr right you

1006
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,119
have to do a data mapping exercise so

1007
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:49,280
it's important that you understand how

1008
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,440
this happens in your org because

1009
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,200
ultimately you need to be able to

1010
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,359
communicate with your business partners

1011
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:57,280
you need to understand well is this

1012
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,520
really a risk when they're communicating

1013
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,079
this to me and what's the risk scoring

1014
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:03,599
here you can't do that if you don't

1015
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,440
understand the technologies and so your

1016
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,800
grc team needs training on understanding

1017
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,480
the technologies

1018
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,320
and once you have that you'll see that

1019
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,240
the communication again going back to

1020
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,240
like prong one there the communication

1021
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,200
will get better because the business or

1022
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,119
maybe the smes and the product in

1023
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:22,400
engineering

1024
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,320
actually see them trying to understand

1025
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,599
the technologies and they're getting

1026
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,119
less frustrated with them and happen to

1027
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,800
spend time telling them how the

1028
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,560
technology works and they can have more

1029
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,960
of a collaborative conversation

1030
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,520
on the flip side the business should

1031
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,240
understand technologies that impact them

1032
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,640
if i require everybody to go through the

1033
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,480
vendor review process for vendors that

1034
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,320
they're trying to onboard they should

1035
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,400
understand that technology

1036
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,800
it should be streamlined it should be

1037
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,960
user friendly and if it's not they're

1038
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,160
not going to want to do it and you're

1039
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,440
going to have vendors that slip through

1040
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,880
the cracks and you'll have vendors that

1041
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,640
you're sending data to because people

1042
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,119
didn't follow the process because it's

1043
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:00,480
not intuitive

1044
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,560
so understand your technologies both

1045
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,720
from the grc side and what the business

1046
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,640
interfaces with

1047
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,720
decoding controls

1048
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,680
man

1049
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,599
controls they're sometimes really hard

1050
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,760
to understand what you need to do right

1051
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,000
you need your special decoder glasses

1052
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,480
and if we need decoder glasses to figure

1053
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,680
out what these controls from these

1054
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,680
frameworks are telling us there's no way

1055
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,520
the business is going to understand

1056
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,680
so if your team cannot take a control

1057
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,599
and go explain it to an implementer

1058
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,680
an individual contributor the work is

1059
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,280
actually it's not going to get done and

1060
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,160
so your team needs to know how do i

1061
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,760
explain this in a consumable way for the

1062
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,000
business to understand and how can i

1063
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,359
communicate this control upwards to the

1064
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:49,520
c-suite so they understand the impact of

1065
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,359
this control

1066
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:53,359
if you're not doing that it's not going

1067
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,359
to get done and so not only does the

1068
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,119
team need to be trained in how to

1069
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,640
communicate this

1070
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,720
they also need to be trained in how they

1071
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,160
sit people down and talk to them um for

1072
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,880
this particular item i actually spent a

1073
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,800
year contracting after i got out of the

1074
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,680
military where i would take disa stigs

1075
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,520
and sit down with system administrators

1076
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,760
and network engineers and explain to

1077
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,599
them what that disa stick was trying to

1078
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,839
tell them to do and

1079
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,280
they likely would have never gotten

1080
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,400
through those because if anybody's

1081
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,480
worked with disa sticks before you know

1082
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,320
they're very long they're very

1083
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,560
comprehensive and you need your special

1084
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,880
decoder glasses to look at them so i

1085
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,040
take that away and i apply it to my

1086
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,720
teams what are the things they are

1087
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,079
really knowledgeable about and what are

1088
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,680
the things that they're not and how can

1089
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,680
i teach them to understand these

1090
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,359
controls better and communicate them to

1091
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:42,480
the people that actually need to

1092
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,400
implement them

1093
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,040
and then effectiveness testing so

1094
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,680
effectiveness of testing it applies to

1095
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,400
both your grc team and it applies to the

1096
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,520
business so are you testing how

1097
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,000
effective your processes are if you have

1098
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,480
a manual process let's take vendor

1099
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,320
reviews again if you have a vendor

1100
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,440
review process that's like 20 steps

1101
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,280
are you evaluating the effectiveness of

1102
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,599
it often probably not because it's at 20

1103
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,839
steps and it doesn't need to be so

1104
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:14,000
figure out how you're evaluating your

1105
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,320
program's time over time and teach your

1106
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,480
teams how to evaluate the program and

1107
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,920
then enable your teams to speak up when

1108
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,160
they think these are ineffective

1109
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,400
right we need to allow our teams to have

1110
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,480
the safety the psychological safety in

1111
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,400
order to feel like they can speak up and

1112
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,160
say we have ineffective programs

1113
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,079
happening so you're teaching them how to

1114
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:37,040
evaluate the programs you are defining

1115
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,200
the criteria for the effectiveness

1116
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,359
and having them go forward and do the

1117
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:43,760
things and then on the opposite side

1118
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,359
you need to teach the business the same

1119
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:47,599
thing they own a lot of the controls and

1120
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:48,800
the things that we need them to

1121
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,280
implement and if they don't know how to

1122
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,520
evaluate it for its effectiveness how

1123
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,880
are they going to approve it they're

1124
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,480
just going to be stuck in a perpetual

1125
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,160
loop or just doing something for the

1126
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,560
sake of doing it without understanding

1127
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,880
how can i make this more effective so

1128
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,640
the effectiveness testing is super

1129
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,880
critical and actually ties into one of

1130
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,200
the bullets that i'm going to talk about

1131
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,119
next so

1132
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:14,160
when we talk about enabling the business

1133
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,079
the second bullet there talks about

1134
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,880
measurement and metrics so tying in from

1135
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,040
effectiveness testing you got to

1136
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,160
understand your your measurement metrics

1137
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,880
that first bullet there is trust and

1138
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,200
transparency so

1139
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,800
trust it's really critical what we do in

1140
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,240
security right

1141
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,560
that's all we do confidentiality

1142
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,640
integrity availability

1143
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,520
trust

1144
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,720
and

1145
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,920
if we are not building rapport with our

1146
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,880
business partners if we are not enabling

1147
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,280
them they're not trusting us

1148
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,960
you're not going to have a good program

1149
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,680
operating i know at this point in time

1150
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,520
any of my peers can come to me and we

1151
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,560
can have

1152
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,520
a dialogue and they know they trust that

1153
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,680
i am going to go do things to take care

1154
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,599
of their team i'm going to help them

1155
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:04,160
take action just like they can trust

1156
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,680
anybody from my team because they've

1157
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,119
built that rapport that we're going to

1158
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:10,000
go take action and help them

1159
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,839
and then transparency

1160
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:14,079
i don't believe in keeping secrets i

1161
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:16,000
think my team should know all the

1162
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,200
information

1163
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,480
and so once i start enabling my team to

1164
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,960
have the same information that i have

1165
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,599
they go forward they understand they

1166
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:27,200
understand the goals and objectives of

1167
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,200
what we're trying to do i'm not trying

1168
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,440
to operate in a silo i'm really trying

1169
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,040
to make sure that

1170
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,800
they know what they need to do for their

1171
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,200
job and that comes with transparency

1172
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,480
additionally when we talk about

1173
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,000
transparency

1174
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,319
it's important that the business always

1175
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:44,400
understands what's going on

1176
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,480
security should not have the secret

1177
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,960
security should not be holding the keys

1178
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,960
to the kingdom of all the risk that we

1179
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,800
have we should be communicating these

1180
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,119
things again well in advance and so we

1181
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:57,599
create this trust and transparency loop

1182
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,200
that's happening where the business

1183
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,720
knows they can count on us they know

1184
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,040
they can come to us and we're creating

1185
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,119
transparency of how our program is

1186
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,319
operating

1187
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:08,560
so trust and transparency highly

1188
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,359
recommend you take that concept and you

1189
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:16,279
ensure it's implied at your organization

1190
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,480
measurement metrics this is one of my

1191
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,920
favorite things i get so giddy over

1192
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,079
doing some sort of analysis of how my

1193
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:29,040
program's operating this is how i know

1194
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,520
for certain at my organization for my

1195
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,760
client questionnaires it takes me three

1196
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,880
days to respond to 60 questions from a

1197
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,720
client and it takes me seven days if

1198
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,599
it's over 150 questions i know for

1199
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:43,839
certain it ha we have a five-day

1200
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:46,000
turnaround for when the business asks us

1201
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,560
to review any sort of document i know i

1202
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,079
have a three-day turnaround for

1203
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:52,319
contracts and it's because i've done the

1204
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:55,119
back-end data and analytics on it that

1205
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:56,640
was the first thing i did when i started

1206
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,119
taking over this because

1207
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:00,480
how are you going to improve if you

1208
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,560
don't understand the numbers right

1209
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,079
there's certain things that you can

1210
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:06,079
improve because you witness it or you

1211
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:08,000
hear it but there's other things you

1212
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,440
can't just make assumptions you really

1213
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,160
do need the data and analytics behind it

1214
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,640
so i highly recommend you look at your

1215
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,960
program for every process that you have

1216
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,680
operating have you defined out

1217
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,480
measurement and metrics criteria

1218
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,119
so look at that and then

1219
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:27,440
improve over time this is where you can

1220
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,960
get yourself into a continuous

1221
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,359
improvement cycle

1222
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:33,440
that is a really great thing that you

1223
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,640
can do for your organization if you can

1224
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,160
get yourself into a continuous

1225
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,800
improvement cycle you will improve year

1226
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,200
over year over year because you

1227
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,000
recognize that is a critical thing for

1228
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,160
your org

1229
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,760
additionally when you do your metrics

1230
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,119
you start to get an understanding of

1231
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,599
your maturity do you really just want to

1232
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:55,440
be doing the bare minimum and be a check

1233
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,760
box activity happening or do you want

1234
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,400
your program to be operating at the

1235
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,359
point that it's so effective that it's

1236
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:05,520
always enabling the business and maybe

1237
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,520
it's even low touch because you've

1238
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,119
automated processes and you've done all

1239
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:12,160
the things that you've needed to

1240
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,079
automation

1241
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:16,079
i love automation when it comes to grc

1242
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,079
there have been so many improvements in

1243
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:20,240
this space where you can take a vendor

1244
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,040
review almost through the entire cycle

1245
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,440
automated and it's seriously great if

1246
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,079
you guys have not evaluated that with

1247
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:30,400
your own organization please take a look

1248
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,640
at it because i promise you the return

1249
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,280
on investment from reduced overhead of

1250
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,040
employees managing these manual

1251
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,280
processes is well worth the time and

1252
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,400
effort to evaluate how can you automate

1253
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,880
leverage grc tools if your budget allows

1254
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,280
so if you're at an organization that you

1255
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,359
have a budget that will let you get a

1256
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:51,680
grc tool please look into it because it

1257
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:52,960
really does help with how you're

1258
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,640
managing your program there's a lot of

1259
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,400
functionality built into there for the

1260
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,160
metrics so take a look at that

1261
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,520
technical expectations ahead of time

1262
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,240
my engineering and product team should

1263
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,480
always know my expectations when they

1264
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,560
are trying to roll out something new

1265
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,240
nothing should ever be a surprise to

1266
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,720
this to them and we do that by having

1267
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,000
guardrails

1268
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,040
what are the things that you can do that

1269
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,599
don't go outside of my guard rails

1270
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:23,119
they should have this information and

1271
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:25,200
you should be training them because what

1272
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,040
then happens is a reduction in them

1273
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,560
having to have one-off conversations

1274
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,319
with you they feel more comfortable and

1275
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:31,599
confident in the things that they need

1276
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:32,400
to do

1277
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,000
but you have to give that to them in the

1278
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,400
first place and if you are not in a

1279
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,920
place where you can give that you're

1280
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,760
automatically blocking the business from

1281
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,079
being effective so you really do need to

1282
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:44,480
understand the guard rails and how they

1283
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,119
apply to your organization

1284
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,720
and then additionally building security

1285
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,640
into ci cd pipelines

1286
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,880
is there a way you can codify the things

1287
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,520
that you need for them within the entire

1288
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,720
life cycle

1289
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,720
and have it implemented

1290
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,359
if if possible please please please take

1291
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:02,720
that avenue and make sure people

1292
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,760
understand it because now you are

1293
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,599
really enabling the business you're not

1294
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:09,440
a blocker all the time right the theme

1295
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,960
of this talk is how we enable the

1296
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,839
business how we get them to work better

1297
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:15,760
harder stronger and still do the

1298
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,520
security things that we need them to do

1299
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:24,160
okay so we got through the entire swiss

1300
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,839
army knife there's tons of prongs in

1301
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:27,520
there i talked about a lot of different

1302
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,440
concepts a lot of them geared around

1303
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,440
communication so

1304
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,599
take that away guys communication super

1305
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:35,280
critical

1306
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,400
building relationships i spend so much

1307
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,319
of my time building relationships and

1308
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:42,160
you know what i love it i love getting

1309
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,920
to know my peers i love getting to know

1310
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,680
the people in the organization because

1311
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,480
it allows me to help them i want to make

1312
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,079
sure that they're doing things that i

1313
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:52,319
need them to do and sometimes they need

1314
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,160
a listening ear sometimes they need

1315
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,160
someone in their corner and i can do

1316
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,040
that

1317
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,560
by listening to them and building

1318
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,800
relationships and then eventually they

1319
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,800
come to trust me and when i need them

1320
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,079
for something

1321
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:06,560
they help me and it really is for the

1322
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:07,760
best

1323
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,440
intentions for the organization to make

1324
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,760
sure that you really have

1325
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,599
those relationships built

1326
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,280
automate where possible

1327
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,440
automation is your friend you are i'm

1328
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,720
serious you're going to reduce so much

1329
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,079
overhead once you figure out how to

1330
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:23,200
automate processes and now your team can

1331
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,680
focus on building relationships doing

1332
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,599
training doing this other things instead

1333
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:30,559
of spending hours over hours answering a

1334
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,960
questionnaire or reviewing a vendor when

1335
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,200
it could otherwise be a automated

1336
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,800
process

1337
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,240
choose simplicity over complexity

1338
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,880
one of the things that makes it so

1339
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,880
challenging to work with grc

1340
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,480
is we have so many things that people

1341
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,000
have to talk to us about and we seem so

1342
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,079
clunky you have to do

1343
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:54,640
steps a b c d f all whatever and we seem

1344
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,200
so clunky and it's because our processes

1345
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,520
generally are complex and so

1346
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,920
figure out how you can simplify and meet

1347
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,839
the things that you need to do because

1348
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,200
the business

1349
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,880
they will love it if it's easy for them

1350
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,480
to do they're going to be more inclined

1351
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,160
to do it

1352
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,640
use the right communication channel so

1353
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,319
understand these different communication

1354
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:16,400
channels how they apply to your org and

1355
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,119
then integrate into the sales pipeline

1356
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:21,119
i only touched on client questionnaires

1357
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:23,599
just a little bit but it's super

1358
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:26,400
critical if you our organization which

1359
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,720
you likely are that have tons of client

1360
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,400
questionnaires come in

1361
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,119
understand your own sales life cycle at

1362
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:34,640
your organization

1363
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,160
how do you partner with sales to get

1364
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,040
ahead of it if you work in compliance or

1365
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,400
if you're in my position you tend to

1366
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,440
read a lot of contracts dsas other

1367
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,200
things like that for the security aspect

1368
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:48,000
but you also have questionnaires so

1369
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,920
get in that sales pipeline ahead of time

1370
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,760
because it does create undue burden to

1371
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,119
the team to have these random

1372
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:54,559
questionnaires pop up through the week

1373
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:55,760
and then you have to load balance

1374
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,240
appropriately so get into the the sales

1375
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,920
pipeline and

1376
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,720
understand how you can leverage that to

1377
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,240
your benefit if you know you're gonna

1378
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,760
have a bunch of questionnaires come in

1379
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,359
august well maybe you shouldn't be

1380
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:09,520
planning any major compliance activities

1381
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,359
then and your team needs to be load

1382
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:12,720
balanced to plan for these

1383
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,359
questionnaires

1384
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,760
so we've reached the end i i think i

1385
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,760
saved enough time cat for a couple

1386
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,559
questions if people have some um so you

1387
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:24,559
