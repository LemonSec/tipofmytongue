1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,159
good morning everybody

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,560
i'm the one right before lunch so lucky

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,240
me and everything i won't feel offended

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,600
if 30 minutes in you're like all right

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,320
i'm hungry uh type of thing but

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,160
today we're talking about pci

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,400
now

8
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,600
[Laughter]

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,439
um so obviously there's been a big

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,119
change with pci

11
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,800
in march they release a new one so we're

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,000
going to be talking about a little bit

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,519
of what the changes are how could it

14
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,599
impact the environment um things of that

15
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:28,480
nature

16
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,359
uh before that i'm justin leapline i've

17
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,680
been involved in and out of consulting

18
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,200
i've worked at a number of companies

19
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,160
where i had to deal with pci um i've

20
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,760
worked for an acquirer i work for an

21
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,960
issuer work for you know e-commerce you

22
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,640
name it i've probably done the standard

23
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,039
within pci i ran the pci practice at

24
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,760
trustedsec for about six years um so i'm

25
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,360
going to go through a little bit of that

26
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,840
stuff um working right now i'm actually

27
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,360
uh self-employed

28
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,640
working on a product for uh grc tool for

29
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,280
smaller companies um i'm an alliance

30
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,520
faculty and i actually just this week

31
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,680
launched up a roasting uh coffee

32
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,680
roasting company so like i didn't have

33
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,280
enough time you know to do anything else

34
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,840
i figured i'd do something else here so

35
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,920
let's get started

36
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,000
so first off uh we're not going to talk

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,560
about in-depth pci all this stuff

38
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,040
there's plenty of resources out there

39
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,960
we're going to strictly focus on the

40
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,799
delta of what 4.0 is bringing to the

41
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,960
table so if it deals with that and what

42
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,080
they're changing and everything we're

43
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,520
going to be talking about that

44
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,000
if it's the rest of pci how it impacts

45
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,360
scope and everything we're going to

46
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,960
touch a little bit on scope but more how

47
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,119
it's changing with it

48
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,119
the text i'm going to have it's going to

49
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,680
be pretty nerdy kind of bolted out with

50
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,320
this but my intention to this is that

51
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,240
you'll take this as a resource bring it

52
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,000
to your company and then you can use it

53
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,560
as kind of a checklist for when pci

54
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,720
actually comes to fruition you'll be

55
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,799
able to kind of check box it off within

56
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,040
your environment and do this so

57
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,119
keep that in mind also too from photos

58
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,360
perspective i have links at the end so

59
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,360
you can take a picture of that download

60
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,960
the full presentation so you don't have

61
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,799
to take pictures all the way through

62
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,280
just as an fyi

63
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,959
all right so what has changed so

64
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,959
they added 64 new controls into

65
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,480
4.0 so 321 was out there for years

66
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,599
now with 4.0 they're adding a ton of new

67
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,560
controls uh for merchants there's 53 of

68
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,319
them uh with that and then service

69
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,239
provider there's 11 that are strictly

70
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,560
for service providers um and if you

71
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,920
don't know what you know the difference

72
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,519
are merchants is if you're swiping the

73
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,120
card and that money's going directly

74
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,519
into your pocket you're a merchant and a

75
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,200
service provider is you're providing

76
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,959
services for

77
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,040
companies that are doing that so an aws

78
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,640
would be a service provider for

79
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,160
merchants that are being hosted within

80
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,440
aws

81
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,160
now there's a lot of different deadlines

82
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,360
to this

83
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,920
immediate when we say immediate is the

84
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,280
first time you're using pci 4.0 as an

85
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,120
attestation document so whether you're

86
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,280
doing saq or whether you're doing a

87
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,120
full-blown rock

88
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,120
immediate is the first time you're using

89
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,440
the 4.0 standard to submit for your

90
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,159
attestation those controls

91
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,480
become immediately effective when you're

92
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,400
first using that but there's a lot of

93
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,480
four data controls as well

94
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,879
and they are best practices all the way

95
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,519
up to march 31st of 2025 so there's

96
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,560
plenty of time for this um so there's

97
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,519
different varied degrees of that

98
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:30,959
so first off

99
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,120
one of the big changes is a customized

100
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,360
approach so what is the customized

101
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,680
approach so they have basically what

102
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,560
they call the defined standard uh which

103
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,480
is the typical stuff the stuff that's

104
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,000
already in there they say you should do

105
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,200
it this way

106
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,920
the straight pci one the customized

107
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,920
approach replaces the

108
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,680
compensating controls so if you're

109
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,760
familiar with compensating controls they

110
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,799
are i can't do it exactly the way their

111
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,959
a pci is telling me i have a business

112
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,120
limitation whether it be financially to

113
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,439
put it in technically to put it in and

114
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,599
now i basically have to come up with a

115
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,599
here's how i'm kind of getting around it

116
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,080
so if you can encrypt on your mainframe

117
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,439
you have to make it really hard to even

118
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,360
get into your mainframe to get that data

119
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,680
that would be an example of a you know

120
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,440
compensating control

121
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,000
with that so they got a rid of that

122
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,639
there is no limitation on

123
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,800
for that for you to be able to use that

124
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,720
you can use customize approach whenever

125
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,360
you want to say there's a new technology

126
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,400
that's all

127
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,800
behavioral ai and it eliminates all

128
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,639
viruses from all systems but it doesn't

129
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,320
technically meet any of the like

130
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,840
directly with that you can actually

131
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,600
produce a customized control say this is

132
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,199
why it's better we've done a risk

133
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,040
assessment here's where it goes you know

134
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,440
type of thing so in this if you see kind

135
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,440
of the requirements here you know they

136
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,960
have the defined approach that's a

137
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,040
standard you know control with that but

138
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,040
then they have the customize approach

139
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,960
objective so if you're producing a

140
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,960
customized approach a custom kind of

141
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,080
design to accomplish that objective

142
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,919
this is what you're aiming to accomplish

143
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:02,880
with this

144
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,880
now i will say reading through some of

145
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,759
these

146
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,160
they're not the best description of

147
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,840
these like sometimes they just re

148
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,520
reiterate what the defined approach is

149
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,360
it's not really the objective of like

150
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,360
keeping bad guys out or not exploiting

151
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,639
malware or something like that they're

152
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,960
just like you know mfa you should have

153
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,120
mfa you know it's like okay well what's

154
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,600
the actual like objective is to keep

155
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,360
unauthorized people out you know type of

156
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,960
thing they're just saying like you need

157
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,120
more than one factor as the

158
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,199
objective so it'd be interesting to see

159
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,840
as qsas we got a while until qsa start

160
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,759
to interpret this to see how they

161
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:36,960
actually

162
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,120
read into this because right now the

163
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,360
define of the customized approach is

164
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,120
essentially you need more than one

165
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,919
factor so if you're not doing initially

166
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,080
the 841 you need more on the factor you

167
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,840
still need more than one factor with

168
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,720
that

169
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,479
but you can see they do the

170
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,479
applicability reproach this is where

171
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,960
they do like sometimes limitations into

172
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,479
it so you'll see things in the

173
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,199
applicability uh notes that they'll say

174
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,840
you know uh this doesn't apply to point

175
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,560
of sale systems or this is only for this

176
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,440
type of accounts and everything so these

177
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,360
are good things that kind of reference

178
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,880
azure implementing some of the controls

179
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,680
so

180
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,199
what if you want to do a customized

181
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,560
approach customized approach sounds

182
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,639
great you know can't make it directly i

183
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,319
have this new innovative product or i

184
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,319
can't meet you know the the direct

185
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,840
control into this

186
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,840
it's a little bit of work to actually

187
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,759
get to that first off you have to fill

188
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,520
out a control matrix template which is

189
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,440
basically outlining

190
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,280
what you're accomplishing with this

191
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,199
control the testing

192
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,960
requirements and plan that you have with

193
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,440
that with it you have to do a targeted

194
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,800
risk analysis which we're going to be

195
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,720
talking about later they have a lot of

196
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,120
that through now the new requirements

197
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,440
you have to perform your testing now you

198
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,039
can offset some of this to qsa companies

199
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,639
or consulting companies but you're going

200
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,639
to pay for that obviously you know with

201
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,039
it most of the qsa companies i've heard

202
00:06:59,039 --> 00:06:59,919
of

203
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,199
when you're going through especially

204
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,960
with a rock they're going to be charging

205
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,039
extra for any type of customized

206
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,120
approach control that you have into it

207
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,919
so there i've heard people they haven't

208
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,160
fully implemented this you know

209
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,479
but if you have a customized approach

210
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,400
it's going to be a dollar sign per

211
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,199
customized approach added to your cost

212
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,360
with that so just keep that in mind and

213
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,720
then maintaining evidence and then

214
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,000
you're going to have to retain that

215
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,280
evidence and the assessors are going to

216
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,000
have to look over all of that stuff to

217
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,919
be able to approve that customized

218
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,639
approach so some of the templates

219
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,960
with this so this would be the

220
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,199
control matrix

221
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,880
you can see kind of the what

222
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,120
requirements describe it you know

223
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,520
control implemented control performed a

224
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,960
lot of extra work you know to kind of

225
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,479
fill this out you know i'm not going to

226
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,080
go through this in detail but you kind

227
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,240
of get the gist of like it's not just

228
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,000
like hey i'll flip this you know and

229
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,680
it'll be all good there's a lot of work

230
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,599
that actually if you're serious about to

231
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,360
actually implement something along those

232
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,240
lines

233
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,639
and then the targeted risk analysis they

234
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,960
give a template also for this where it

235
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,800
goes through kind of similar to the

236
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,039
compensating control worksheet

237
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,120
identify what you're doing what's the

238
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,639
proposed solution

239
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,319
all that stuff one of the things i'd

240
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,840
love out of this is 1.3 describe the

241
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,039
mischief

242
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,560
that the requirement was designed to

243
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,919
prevent i mean

244
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,440
you know as some english person that

245
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,039
like threw that language in like you

246
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,280
almost think like oh yeah it's some like

247
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,039
evil guy with a mustache you know with

248
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,479
this you could just hear him laughing in

249
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,880
the background but what's even funnier

250
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,320
to this if you actually go to the

251
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,880
definition of mischief like right there

252
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,479
in the middle they give an example of

253
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,760
the mischief is an absence of policy

254
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,240
um and i'm like is that really a

255
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,720
mischief thing like

256
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,800
so yeah it's kind of wonky the way they

257
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,959
kind of describe you know some of these

258
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,240
things here

259
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,720
but you know the the the goal of it is

260
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,040
like if there's a lack of control you

261
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,680
know into it um and looking at that uh

262
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,360
from that perspective there

263
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,080
anyway back to the uh here

264
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,839
so yeah identify the requirement

265
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,000
describe the proposed solution to it

266
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,560
it goes on to analyze the likelihood so

267
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,160
it actually is a targeted risk

268
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,480
assessment you are evaluating on impact

269
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,720
likelihood everything along that lines

270
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,320
you know now

271
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,399
it's not a great calculation i mean

272
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,040
honestly 3.3 you just check the box on

273
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,040
is it more likely is it the same is it

274
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,320
less likely

275
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,959
type of thing um pci kind of allows you

276
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,760
to do whatever into that um

277
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,560
so and the way i know the qsa industry

278
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,080
is they'll probably just allow that as

279
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,000
your risk assessment you know if you

280
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,360
fill out this sheet

281
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,880
with it

282
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,600
and then uh changes uh to it and then

283
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,279
risk approval has to go up to executive

284
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,600
management to approve all this stuff

285
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,880
and keep in mind we'll see in the

286
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,240
controls later

287
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,160
this has to be redone every single year

288
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,200
for all your customized approach so it's

289
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,560
a

290
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,720
it can be good like if you're trying to

291
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,240
do something in the cloud or there's

292
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,600
some product you know that you really

293
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,440
want to utilize not fitting in directly

294
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,760
within pci this can give you flexibility

295
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,920
with it but it's not short of actually

296
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,600
the work that you would also have to do

297
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,440
to actually implement some of this stuff

298
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,000
so just keep that in mind

299
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,160
another thing too that we've kind of

300
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,399
seen this coming um

301
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,839
if you're familiar the cardholder data

302
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,440
environment you know was the typical

303
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,880
definition of systems that store process

304
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,720
or transmit cardholder data that's how

305
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,839
we define cardholder data you know now

306
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,839
they're also dividing cardholder data

307
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,920
that are basically in the same kind of

308
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,959
unfettered network access to around uh

309
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,519
systems that touch cardholder data um

310
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,680
now you'd say justin those systems are

311
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,279
already in scope they're you know around

312
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,760
that you know without any unrestricted

313
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,839
network access the problem is they were

314
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,079
classified as system components and

315
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,680
there are a handful of controls within

316
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,519
pci that actually call out on cd devices

317
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,399
like

318
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,480
administering administering

319
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,800
cde devices with two-factor

320
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,120
authentication internally with that now

321
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,120
this kind of expands the scope other

322
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,360
thing too is that say you have a shared

323
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,920
services environment like and you have

324
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,760
active directory into it or some other

325
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,839
shared services that's

326
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,560
providing service into the cde

327
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,880
if you don't have according to the qsa

328
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,040
or whoever's assessing that

329
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,279
good enough network access controls

330
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,200
between those down to what's business

331
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,360
justified you could basically turn that

332
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,360
system into a cde and then all of a

333
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,200
sudden that system spreads to every

334
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,000
other system in that network as well so

335
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,839
keep in mind like qsas as they're

336
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,800
looking at this it it could expand scope

337
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,640
quite drastically and it really comes

338
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,920
down to how

339
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,320
that definition of like uh network

340
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,200
access and down to business justified

341
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,680
this was something that they introduced

342
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,160
in the guidance documentation

343
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,399
a few years ago and

344
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,519
one of the things we did with our

345
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,880
customers that said well guidance

346
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,560
document had a disclaimer at the bottom

347
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,639
of every single page said this isn't the

348
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,040
standard and it actually contradicted

349
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,519
what the actual 321 standard actually

350
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,320
said

351
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,920
now they're basically pulling it from

352
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,839
the guidance implement it for sure in

353
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,519
this standard here

354
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,240
so just keep that in mind there

355
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,200
so new requirements this is where we're

356
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,160
going to spend most of our time

357
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,079
and i like answering questions so if

358
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,079
there's any confusion or just want to

359
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,680
get a clarification let's do this you

360
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,279
know right in the middle just catch my

361
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,959
eye and everything

362
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,600
so first off they've added

363
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,760
pretty much in every single section

364
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,079
roles and responsibilities performing

365
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,240
activities and requirement whatever are

366
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,959
document assigned and understood so they

367
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,959
kind of had this in requirement one they

368
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,600
actually reworded just to be this

369
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,959
for the network

370
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,320
sections with this that's why that

371
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,399
asterisk is kind of there

372
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,240
but the rest once they added this so you

373
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,160
can accomplish this either through

374
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,560
policy documentation assigning a team to

375
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,480
particular services

376
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,959
racy charts you know in a wiki something

377
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,120
along that lines more documentation you

378
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,760
have to do to you know uh show all these

379
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,600
controls into it

380
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,480
and

381
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,160
the way i kind of have this you know

382
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,160
applies to all entities so that's

383
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,240
merchants and service providers and then

384
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,240
the effective

385
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,959
is immediate so as soon as you use 4.0

386
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,680
as a at the station base you have to

387
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,719
have this uh done

388
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,680
other documentation uh with this um you

389
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,560
have to with your retention with any sad

390
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,600
data

391
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,240
keep in mind this is more to issuers if

392
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,240
they're retaining sad data

393
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,399
you have to have a way to actually clean

394
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,240
that up on whatever your retention

395
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,839
policy is so in card production which i

396
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,360
you know worked a little bit in that

397
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,440
time frame it's typically 30 days you're

398
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,160
allowed to store that information for 30

399
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,839
days and then you have to have a way to

400
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,360
remove it so that's basically just

401
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,519
calling it out into the dss that there

402
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,199
should be a way to actually remove some

403
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,440
of that stuff

404
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,160
there has to be technical controls that

405
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,160
you can't just remove pans through

406
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,240
remote access technology

407
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,199
essentially what this means is dlp you

408
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,199
know there can be other potential

409
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,199
technical means where you might be able

410
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,600
to limit access to dba

411
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,000
individuals and other controls that you

412
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,079
accomplish this but essentially this is

413
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,079
calling out

414
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,720
dlp you know for if people have access

415
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,079
to cardholder data they're not pulling

416
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,760
it over the vpn and putting it on their

417
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,120
local computer

418
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,600
with that

419
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,720
another one from a documentation

420
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,720
standpoint

421
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,480
you have to define your cryptographic

422
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,399
architecture so if you have any soft

423
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,600
hsms certificates anything like that all

424
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,279
has to be documented has to be cleared

425
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,600
to where um your keys are stored where

426
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,040
it's being encrypted

427
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,639
all that stuff and everything and this

428
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,800
is for service providers only but keep

429
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,800
in mind the common rule for service

430
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,800
providers only for this version of

431
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,720
service providers only for the next

432
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,079
version will probably be for merchants

433
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,319
too

434
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,199
for all entities they have to have an

435
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,040
inventory of all your trusted keys and

436
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,040
certificates so there has to be a

437
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,120
documentation pointing to where

438
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,480
everything is you know within your

439
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,160
environment for pci

440
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,600
another thing that's going to be a

441
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,959
little bit bigger you're going to have

442
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,600
to have an inventory of all your

443
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,800
software and all your

444
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,720
third-party stuff so that's custom

445
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,720
applications third-party libraries that

446
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,800
you're doing so you know if you've

447
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,959
followed this the the bill of materials

448
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,399
that they've been saying

449
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,000
all that stuff will have to be

450
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,600
documented and producible to the

451
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,399
assessor as well as any third-party

452
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,000
products that you're installing you know

453
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,279
onto the

454
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,199
onto your environment that has to be

455
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,839
patched into this

456
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,959
and then lastly on the documentation

457
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,199
suites and protocols um in use and

458
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,079
documented and reviewed so you know your

459
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,240
tls certificate you know what's the

460
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,079
cypher suites that you're using what's

461
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,480
the protocols you're allowed with that

462
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,639
obviously you can pull that but now you

463
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,880
have to have a formal document so peers

464
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,480
are approved tls 1.2 you know aes 256

465
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,199
whatever that may be

466
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,199
uh some encryption stuff um

467
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,120
so sad store electronic prior to

468
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,959
completion uh both 3.3.2 and 3.3.3 are

469
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,199
issuers um that apply to so if you're

470
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,040
sore and sad you have to protect it

471
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,600
strong encryption with that they didn't

472
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,600
directly call that out in previous

473
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,959
they're basically just filling in the

474
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,399
blanks you know to some of this stuff

475
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,160
hash is used this is a big one hash is

476
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,880
used to render pans unreadable have to

477
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,440
use salt now you can't just have a

478
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,959
straight hash for your pans

479
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,360
with that it has to be salted to when

480
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,759
it's storing in the back end now

481
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,199
a lot of people will say yeah that's

482
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,040
great you know to be able to do that and

483
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,639
everything which it is but there are uh

484
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,480
potential things that could actually

485
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,039
impact that whereas you know if you're

486
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,119
looking for if you're a grocery store

487
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,720
chain and you're looking for duplicate

488
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,000
card numbers

489
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,599
it's now hard for you to actually just

490
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,439
look in a hash table and say is a

491
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,119
duplicate hash in there because

492
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,880
everything's salted you know into that

493
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,959
perspective so just keep in mind this

494
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,280
could impact some processes

495
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,480
depending on how you're using that hash

496
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,720
another big one they specifically call

497
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,640
out in 3512

498
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,520
that you're not allowed to just rely on

499
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,840
disk or partition level encryption as

500
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,480
your encryption source unless it's a

501
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,360
removable drive so if it's a usb drive

502
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,520
backup tapes or something along that

503
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,559
lines you can rely on you know full disk

504
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,440
encryption ish you know uh with that but

505
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,840
you're not allowed to just store your

506
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,240
documents that contain cardholder data

507
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,400
on an s3 encrypted bucket that's not

508
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,320
allowed it has to be another layer of

509
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,880
encryption onto that that's at the file

510
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,600
level with them

511
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,160
and then certificates over um

512
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,039
just

513
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,520
can't be expired you know with this so

514
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,919
they i guess they had some problems with

515
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,160
this you know at four two one um they're

516
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,160
spa uh specifically just calling out

517
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,000
can't be expired even though it might

518
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,200
still go over tls 1.2 and get a warning

519
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,880
on the consumer they're saying like it

520
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,919
needs to be about cert

521
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,600
so this is one of the things that we

522
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,760
talked about with periodic reviews so

523
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,200
one of the most common terms that

524
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,520
they've added into this is a targeted

525
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,280
risk analysis

526
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,440
so they gave i showed you the example

527
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,960
they kind of gave and broke it down on

528
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,400
what they would do for a customized

529
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,280
approach

530
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,760
now a lot of things if you remember with

531
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,520
321 there was a lot of things that came

532
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,679
out like you have to periodically review

533
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,440
your you know

534
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,360
gas station pumps to make sure that

535
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,600
there's no tampering or substitution you

536
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,320
have to periodically review whatever

537
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,240
there's a number of components into this

538
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,919
now they're basically a lot of stuff

539
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,440
they're either calling out specifically

540
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,720
like you have to do this every seven

541
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,760
days or do a targeted risk analysis to

542
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,720
you know define your own

543
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,640
number or they'll just call out you need

544
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,559
to do a targeted risk analysis so keep

545
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,039
in mind this has to be reviewed

546
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,039
annually and approved by executive

547
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,960
management for each one of these so

548
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,440
targeted risk analysis on any systems

549
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,640
you deem

550
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,400
not applicable to

551
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,039
uh malware protection so linux systems

552
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,360
let's say you don't install any av on

553
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,440
linux systems you have to do a targeted

554
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,679
risk analysis on an annual basis that

555
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,520
say yes they're still out of scope for

556
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,400
uh anti-malware um

557
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,039
the frequency of malware scans they call

558
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,280
out continuous you know in the standard

559
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,880
now

560
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,880
but if you have an alternate like you're

561
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,320
scanning weekly you have to have a

562
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,720
targeted risk analysis

563
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,120
inspections on point uh point and

564
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,720
interaction device uh point of sale

565
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,840
devices

566
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,520
and then the determinant of the

567
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,760
frequency of log reviews and on all

568
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,120
other system components you have to

569
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,720
review it all on the

570
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,559
um the cde but you have flexibility when

571
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,799
it has outside systems with that

572
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:11,620
and then

573
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,760
[Music]

574
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,600
on how frequently

575
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,320
the targeted risk analysis so this is um

576
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,720
has to be performed to review that and

577
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,960
then uh met with a customized approach

578
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,880
that's three one three two uh what we

579
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,320
talked about with that

580
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,400
and then uh periodic training for

581
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,760
incident response personnel you have

582
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,320
flexibility on you know how often you do

583
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,799
that uh to individuals so there's a lot

584
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,799
of work with this we'll talk about at

585
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,559
the end like the

586
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,159
outside of some of the technical

587
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,679
controls and limitations that they're

588
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,520
implementing in this

589
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,919
a lot of this stuff comes from more

590
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,840
resources internally and potentially

591
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,480
externally on helping you basically just

592
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,799
maintain your security program and

593
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,559
building it up to where it needs to be

594
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,360
for 4.0 luckily we got some time

595
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,520
but yeah there's a lot of work to kind

596
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,760
of do this

597
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,919
going on further outside of the targeted

598
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,240
risk analysis periodic reviews

599
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,919
now they're adding in you have to review

600
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,840
user accounts and

601
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,320
and access privileges appropriately that

602
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,960
wasn't a thing in pci before now it's

603
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,880
sox world all over again you have to

604
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,760
review your access you know on a regular

605
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,799
basis um they're adding in system and

606
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,880
application accounts before pci didn't

607
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,880
really touch on this qsa's were kind of

608
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,400
like hey it shouldn't degrade the

609
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,159
security like you could just don't set

610
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,480
the accounts to password um you know

611
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,000
type of thing now they're specifically

612
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,720
calling out that application system

613
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,039
accounts are in scope and use they

614
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,840
should also be reviewed uh with that

615
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,840
hardware and software technologies are

616
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,840
reviewed so one of the requirements is

617
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,600
putting together a list of all your

618
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,360
hardware and software one of the main

619
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,840
things that kind of called the like call

620
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,720
this out is like when's end of life so

621
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,840
if you're using some windows system 2012

622
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,679
you're supposed to document like when is

623
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,720
end of life for this system and the qsa

624
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,400
assessor whoever it is

625
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,919
takes that and reviews it to make sure

626
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,960
that you're all within supported area or

627
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,720
have a customized approach you know that

628
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,120
you could also do with them

629
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:13,919
um

630
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,600
12.52

631
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,760
kind of was a requirement so if you were

632
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,600
ever going through and doing a rock up

633
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,360
in the top section the the kind of

634
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,000
requirement zero as we called it um

635
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,679
actually called out you had to review

636
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,720
your scoping and confirm it uh each year

637
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,480
now they're basically putting this as a

638
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,799
specific requirement so you can write

639
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:35,280
verbage directly to that

640
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,240
and

641
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,480
then the significant organization

642
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,240
changes with that and this is service

643
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,840
provider only you basically have to

644
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,080
review that and communicate to exit

645
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,960
executive management

646
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,000
um

647
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,120
sorry repeat one and then security

648
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,480
awareness program

649
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,679
um

650
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,760
has reviewed every 12 months and update

651
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,080
as needed so you can't use the same

652
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,240
stuff that you use for like five years

653
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,559
now it has to be updated we'll actually

654
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,159
cover a little bit that they've added

655
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,000
phishing as a requirement into this as

656
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,039
well

657
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,520
and then this is for sp only that if

658
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,679
you're logging into multiple customers

659
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,320
there has to be a separation between the

660
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,840
different customers you can't just be

661
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,600
connected to all customers at the same

662
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,400
time

663
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,720
type of thing

664
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,159
all right monitoring so

665
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,159
one of the bigger things that was also

666
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,400
added in is

667
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,960
monitoring your payment page for um uh

668
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,200
for like changes on all the scripts and

669
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,039
everything so this is content security

670
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,120
policy if you're familiar with this

671
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,400
outlining where you're getting your

672
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,840
scripts from if there's any remote

673
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,440
scripts you're doing you're pulling them

674
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,080
uh appropriately you it has to be hashed

675
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,080
so you have to verify the integrity of

676
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,440
it

677
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,200
there's a lot of work into that and keep

678
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,799
in mind we'll talk about this a little

679
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,120
bit later but they even add this into

680
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,400
the saqs as well and even into saqa this

681
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,000
is one of the additional requirements

682
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,679
into saqa which is basically have

683
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,520
outsourced almost everything

684
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,720
this is one of those ones if you're

685
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,799
doing an e-commerce page you'll have to

686
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,080
make sure that you have a content

687
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,320
security policy

688
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,600
no longer

689
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,520
can you have the option to do manual

690
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,240
review of logs or automated review

691
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,919
they're just calling out automated

692
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,919
review of logs which is a good thing

693
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:24,880
because

694
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,799
my firm opinion nobody really does

695
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,559
manual review logs and when we say

696
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,640
manual review vlogs we're basically

697
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,200
talking about you going into your syslog

698
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,760
server and looking at the logs and

699
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,679
validating that there's nothing wrong

700
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,279
nobody's really doing that you know type

701
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,679
of thing there's some type of automated

702
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,159
triggering system and triaging of those

703
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,600
that's what they're calling out it's

704
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,520
like there has to be some

705
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,480
um you know sim that's raising alarms

706
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,240
that you're triaging in that respect

707
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,600
there

708
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,520
um a lot of things that they got in in

709
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,960
three is

710
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,120
looking at

711
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,880
your security controls and calling out

712
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,600
when they failed um they're adding

713
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,480
things to that that if certain controls

714
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,559
fail you're notified and deal with it

715
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,520
accordingly so uh critical security

716
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,159
control systems are alerted detected and

717
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:15,760
dressed promptly and responded to

718
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,520
promptly

719
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,559
and then 11 they call out that you have

720
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,039
to detect through ids ips some other

721
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,000
means

722
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,360
you know edr

723
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,640
that there's convert malware

724
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,600
communication channels so um

725
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,120
you know

726
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,240
c2

727
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,640
you know with that um and just looking

728
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,000
at that and detecting and doing that

729
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,720
that's sp only right now but again it's

730
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,000
only a matter of time before it comes

731
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,480
merchants as well

732
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,320
and then change in tampering detection

733
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,480
mechanisms is deployed for payment pages

734
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,799
so specifically on the payment page

735
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,960
and it calls out once a week or you can

736
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,240
define it through a targeted risk

737
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,919
analysis you basically have to look at

738
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,360
your payment page and see if it's

739
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,760
changed and do something if you didn't

740
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,600
expect it to change so some type of

741
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,640
monitoring and kind of hashing of that

742
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,960
page and detecting whether it's changed

743
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,240
without you

744
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,000
without you being aware of the the

745
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,640
change to production

746
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,600
and then failures this is you know um a

747
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,440
couple of additions automated log review

748
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,360
mechanisms you know have to alert on the

749
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,200
failure of those and then code review

750
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,840
tools um have to look at that so if you

751
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,679
have a

752
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:26,640
devsecops pipeline and it's running to

753
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,440
look at third party packages static code

754
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,520
analysis if that fails you need to be

755
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,200
alerted that it has failed

756
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,799
do we need a break here i mean there's a

757
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,960
lot

758
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,120
and like i said my intention for this is

759
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,080
to give this to whoever wants it and

760
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,600
that way you can have kind of your

761
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,080
checklist to go through and utilize it

762
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,960
on uh the off so yeah the time frames

763
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,440
are you know nice that we got a lot of

764
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,480
time but

765
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,640
i wouldn't wait because there's a lot of

766
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,960
little things that are need to be done

767
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,679
within the next couple of years

768
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,039
for this so

769
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,440
um i think we're almost done here got a

770
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,120
couple more sections so vulnerability

771
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,600
anti-malware um

772
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,559
um

773
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,400
look at electronic media so when you

774
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,960
plug in a usb drive it has to scan it

775
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,640
most you know solutions have that

776
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,240
nowadays so it shouldn't be too big a

777
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,120
deal they're just calling it out um

778
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,520
mexican is a place to detect fishing uh

779
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,320
with that so you know that means email

780
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,399
protection you know on some of the

781
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,480
fishing perspective this wasn't called

782
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,039
out before now you have to have a way to

783
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,279
detect certain phishing stuff you could

784
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,600
probably do it through some edr um

785
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,120
aspects as well

786
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,240
but this is one of the things that

787
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,960
you'll need to measure with it

788
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,600
automated technology so wafts are now

789
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,679
required before it was a kind of you can

790
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,919
do an application assessment once a year

791
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,480
or do a waff now wafts are required you

792
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,240
know with anything that's public facing

793
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,360
it takes cardholder data

794
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,200
manage all other application

795
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,720
vulnerabilities they're specific calling

796
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,360
out application vulnerabilities um that

797
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,840
aren't high or critical risk so you have

798
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,279
to manage them they're not necessarily

799
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,200
calling out that you have to fix them

800
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,200
but you have to have an active program

801
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,120
to manage you can't say medium below

802
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,799
whatever you know type of thing there

803
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,279
has to be a kind of a determination on

804
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,120
are we going to fix it are we not is

805
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,200
what's a risk to the organization

806
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,240
um

807
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,799
another big one that's changing no

808
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:32,000
longer that vulnerability scans can be

809
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,240
just network based

810
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,399
it's either agent based or credentialed

811
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:37,440
based

812
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,279
obviously you know my preference is

813
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,520
agent based but you can have the option

814
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,440
to do credentials

815
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,279
around with them

816
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,120
and then 1147 multi-tenant service

817
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,960
providers

818
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,960
support their customers for external

819
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,039
penetration testing this basically came

820
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,039
about there's you know

821
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,720
some bigger players but they've modified

822
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,159
a lot but there's some smaller players

823
00:28:58,159 --> 00:28:59,919
that if you have a you know remote

824
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,520
hosting data center or something like

825
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,919
that um they would like oh you're not

826
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:05,440
allowed to scan us you're not allowed to

827
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,360
do a penetration even though it was your

828
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,120
site and then was like well are you

829
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,880
doing the penetration test then like no

830
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,640
that wasn't part of our contract so

831
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,000
they're basically calling out like if

832
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,200
you're a multi-tenant service provider

833
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,520
you have to support your customers if

834
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,360
they want to do a penetration test and

835
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,199
just calling it out verbatim into that

836
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,640
identity and access control so this was

837
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,720
a little bit of one where they've um

838
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,399
intermixed um some of the uh nist 800

839
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:35,679
changes into it uh for good um for most

840
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:38,559
of it um some of it they didn't really

841
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,360
change as much as i would like but you

842
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,520
know so you have to manage we mentioned

843
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,200
application system accounts you know

844
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,279
into this um

845
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,120
you have to do a minimal of capacity for

846
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,840
passwords when used as an authentic

847
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,480
factor that's now up to 12

848
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,840
with that they do allow an exception for

849
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,240
systems that don't support up to 12 aka

850
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,919
mainframes you know type of thing and it

851
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,320
has to be at the maximum of that

852
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,480
with it they actually specifically

853
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,840
called that out in 836

854
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,799
they still have that passwords are the

855
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:15,200
only authentication piece it has to be

856
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,840
changed every 90 days you can adjust

857
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,720
that with a targeted risk analysis

858
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,559
but they still have the default 90 days

859
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,120
if it's a single factor to log into that

860
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,799
if it's multi-factor so if you're going

861
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,960
into your cloud environment and it's

862
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,960
always through multi-factor you can up

863
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,799
that to a year you know that you don't

864
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:35,039
have to change it or maybe not in like

865
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,960
indefinitely you can also

866
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,279
put in other factors where you look at

867
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:40,960
where the account is coming from so if

868
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,200
they're logging in from nigeria and they

869
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,360
never logged in from nigeria then that

870
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,440
would do some extra flag so you have

871
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,799
some flexibility in actually

872
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,720
implementing uh some of this stuff

873
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,080
um

874
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,720
multi-factor authentication for all

875
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,440
access into the cde um with this

876
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,679
so this is one thing that they added get

877
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:03,279
out that anytime you're going into the

878
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,679
cde you have to have multi-factor access

879
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,519
the change from the last system that all

880
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,080
they had was administrative access this

881
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,679
is basically anybody logging in so if

882
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:14,720
it's a accounting person logging into

883
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,440
a

884
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,279
you know a system that have a

885
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,279
spreadsheet of cardholder data probably

886
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:22,080
a bad idea but example with that

887
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,640
they have to do multi-factor so

888
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,720
mainframe access may have to do

889
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,679
multi-factor if they have a green screen

890
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:30,960
that you know is going through and

891
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,720
showing full card data and everything

892
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,960
yep

893
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,519
yep so the question was just to repeat

894
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,600
it does that include web applications

895
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,840
with it the answer is if you can see

896
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,279
full card data onto it the answer is yes

897
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,200
with that now keep in mind i believe

898
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,200
it's this requirement here in one of

899
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,440
those applicable notes

900
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,200
they say it's not applicable to ones

901
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,679
that only can see one card number at a

902
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:00,559
time

903
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:03,279
type of thing so if i'm a point of sale

904
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:04,720
you know with that i'm just entering in

905
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,960
one card at a time it's not applicable

906
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,200
to those but if you have a web

907
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,200
application that can look at a

908
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,200
spreadsheet of card data and say you're

909
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,480
dealing with chargebacks or something

910
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,799
like that that would be a applicable

911
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,918
control good question

912
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,480
multi-factor access on systems that are

913
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,799
on systems are implemented appropriately

914
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:30,080
so just making sure that you can't

915
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,559
escape around it i know the pci council

916
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:35,200
had a big problem at one point that they

917
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,279
had the multi-step authentication they

918
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:38,559
said both factors had to be

919
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,559
authenticated at the same time which is

920
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:41,760
really hard to do when you're doing like

921
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,080
push notifications for it they've

922
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,760
loosened up a little bit um if you

923
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,960
actually read the requirement but they

924
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,799
want to make sure that you can't like

925
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,799
escape around one of the factors you

926
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,640
know um essentially when it comes down

927
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,440
to it

928
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,399
um

929
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,320
manage interactive logins for accounts

930
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,159
used by systems or applications so if

931
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,080
you use a system or an application

932
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,080
account that's used for like back-end

933
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:06,000
stuff um if that is able to do uh

934
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,399
interactive access like it's going over

935
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,880
ssh or going in the application can

936
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,880
perform other functions

937
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,799
you need to manage those appropriately

938
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,519
same kind of thing you know the with the

939
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,360
addition of applications system accounts

940
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,960
are putting in all this stuff to say

941
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,960
okay you need to protect against misuse

942
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,960
so monitoring what they're doing no

943
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,519
escalate like proper privileges fall

944
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,080
into this um

945
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,399
uh with that

946
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:41,440
oh application and system accounts so

947
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,559
uh with that

948
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,200
um and then multi-tenant uh confirms

949
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,880
access to any customer environment

950
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,200
that's logic separated so this is uh sp

951
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,200
only but again the same kind of

952
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,360
component with separating out that

953
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,120
access you know between your different

954
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,120
customers

955
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,440
and then i think lastly no we have a

956
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,360
miscellaneous one right at the end a

957
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,000
little bit on insulin response

958
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,639
that one you have to do

959
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,199
change and tamper detection mechanism so

960
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,119
we mentioned that if your payment page

961
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:14,960
changed you know

962
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,560
you should actually incorporate into

963
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,399
your instant response plan how to deal

964
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,480
with that so different things like that

965
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,719
if something's tamper detected you need

966
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,239
to have a response in your incident

967
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,239
response plan how to do that so a

968
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,320
playbook would work you know to specific

969
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,159
to that

970
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,520
and then incident response plan

971
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,520
procedures are initiated upon detection

972
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,639
of pan outside of the cde scope you know

973
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,119
so if you detect pan in your

974
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,119
share drives you know and it's not

975
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:42,879
supposed to be there you know you need

976
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:46,480
to have a plan to say okay we need to

977
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,879
analyze whole scope look at permissions

978
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,480
who had permissions with that is there

979
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,800
any you know out copying that was done

980
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,280
you know with that education just kind

981
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,839
of writing up something with that

982
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,320
and then have something this is uh

983
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,280
multi-tenant service providers uh for

984
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,520
basically this is a bug bounty thing you

985
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,440
know so if you have if you're a service

986
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,440
provider and your customers find bugs

987
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,200
you need to have a way to deal with them

988
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,240
and then a couple other things we

989
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,680
mentioned phishing and related and

990
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,200
social engineering attacks that's a

991
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,839
specific call out that now qsas will be

992
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,240
looking for that within your training

993
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,920
with it

994
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,000
and then training about acceptable uses

995
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,839
of end user technologies so that was

996
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:31,200
always kind of called out in the

997
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,520
acceptable use in requirement 12. now

998
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,520
they're calling that for the training

999
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,680
annually as well

1000
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,599
and then third-party service providers

1001
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:40,880
um

1002
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,040
you know support the customer's request

1003
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,680
uh to this um you know whenever they're

1004
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,280
asking about their compliance you need

1005
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,160
to respond to them

1006
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,880
all right take deep breath we're through

1007
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,640
the requirements here

1008
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,160
got a couple other small things how are

1009
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,000
we doing on time oh we're good on time

1010
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,880
all right

1011
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:03,040
so saqs so one of the things that's um

1012
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,359
they're adding to saqs if you're an sq

1013
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,599
fill out not only are they adding like

1014
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,440
all the controls that we just mentioned

1015
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,000
into this but they're also adding things

1016
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,839
that were already existing controls one

1017
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,200
of the biggest ones that i've seen so

1018
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,040
far is that now

1019
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,440
saqas which is basically like

1020
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,800
20 30 i think it's 36 controls and a lot

1021
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,240
of that is physical because they can

1022
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,480
still take faxes you know under this uh

1023
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,839
type

1024
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:29,680
now they're adding that you have to do

1025
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,400
acv scan so basically almost every type

1026
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,560
has to do with asv scan this is going to

1027
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,720
blow it up to a lot of different

1028
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,880
merchants that have never done asv scans

1029
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,200
before and probably have never run a

1030
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,520
vulnerability scan as well in their life

1031
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,680
so it'll be interesting to see how this

1032
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,240
kind of grows you know into the industry

1033
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,079
um because one of the biggest things

1034
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:52,640
we'll talk about in just a second is

1035
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,599
people missing their asv you know uh

1036
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:57,119
timeline you're supposed to scan that

1037
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,760
quarterly at least quarterly um if you

1038
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,680
miss that all of a sudden it's a ding

1039
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,560
into your pci

1040
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,599
and report on compliance rocks so these

1041
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,640
are the level one sometimes level two uh

1042
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,560
merchants and service providers uh into

1043
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,480
this so obviously we talked about they

1044
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,720
did away with the compensating control

1045
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,560
worksheet uh but that was one of the

1046
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,400
sections that they did now they have

1047
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,720
they replaced that and now they have in

1048
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,720
place with remediation so what happens

1049
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,160
if you're doing a customized approach

1050
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,320
that's just in place they consider that

1051
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,320
if that's all good and your customized

1052
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,720
approach that's an in place control so

1053
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,200
what is in place with remediation so in

1054
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,480
place with remediation is anytime they

1055
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,920
the assessor finds a ding against you

1056
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,920
um they're going to expect you to

1057
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,400
correct it and then they'll put it in

1058
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,320
place with the remediation with a

1059
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,079
description of why they marked you with

1060
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:52,800
in place with remediation now

1061
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,320
what will this happen is an impact

1062
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,160
probably nothing you know type of thing

1063
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,760
if you're compliant at the end of the

1064
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,000
day and you fix whatever problems that's

1065
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,760
fine you know that type of thing

1066
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,119
but like some of the biggest things that

1067
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,839
when we're doing um rocks for customers

1068
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:07,920
missing asv scans you know that was one

1069
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,760
of the biggest things we had our kind of

1070
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,839
set company policy with this but it was

1071
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:14,079
all over the place from a qsa standpoint

1072
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:16,160
like i've even heard some things like

1073
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,119
ridiculous like um we missed you know

1074
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:21,440
last quarter's asv scan because the guy

1075
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,000
that was doing them just left and nobody

1076
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,480
picked it up so now we're gonna do and i

1077
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,320
had a qsa tell me once it's like well i

1078
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,079
guess you gotta wait for a year to get

1079
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:32,560
compliant because you're missing one qsa

1080
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,720
or one asv scan and you need to have

1081
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,320
four quarters you know type of thing

1082
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,560
that's not the way pci was designed with

1083
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,320
this now they have a specific way they

1084
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,800
uh essentially will do they want to make

1085
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,200
so you have to be fixed you know with

1086
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,760
this so the qsa just say oh you missed

1087
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,760
just the last one okay that's fine you

1088
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,599
know type of thing you have to run

1089
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,000
another scan uh with this you have to

1090
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,560
have a remediation to cover why that

1091
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,720
failed whatever that may be

1092
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,760
and then

1093
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,000
the qsa will review that accept it and

1094
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,400
put it in place with remediation

1095
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,560
noting that there were issues with it

1096
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,440
but you fixed it type of thing and so

1097
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,880
some of the other stuff that

1098
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,359
unintentional storage of like pan

1099
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:18,480
outside the cde missing policies missing

1100
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,480
networks basically anything that wasn't

1101
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,400
compliant right out of the start they're

1102
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,079
supposed to turn it into an in-place

1103
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,800
remediation

1104
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,200
so and then

1105
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,760
here's a little bit of like just the the

1106
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,760
heading so one of the things to keep in

1107
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,680
mind qsa's are going to have a lot more

1108
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,800
documentation work this is one control

1109
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,960
and you don't start writing up control

1110
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,240
until right at the very end all the top

1111
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,040
part

1112
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,079
is just filler information so first off

1113
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:49,839
it's the selection of the boxes then it

1114
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:52,640
goes into you know describe why the

1115
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,119
assessment finding was selected and

1116
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,359
quite honestly it's kind of worthless if

1117
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,760
it's in place it's like because i

1118
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,280
everything checked out like i got the

1119
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,280
evidence everything looked good now it

1120
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,440
might change with in place with uh with

1121
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,839
remediation or not in place you know you

1122
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:10,160
can describe like some of the stuff but

1123
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,680
literally you have to describe why you

1124
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,680
selected that which i think it's kind of

1125
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,280
a worthless you know type of thing you

1126
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,599
could describe it down below

1127
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,560
and then you have to basically say

1128
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,200
a customized approach or a

1129
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,160
control used you know into this for the

1130
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,040
defined or customized approach

1131
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,319
with this so yeah it's uh it's it's a

1132
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:34,720
little messy the biggest thing to get

1133
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,800
out of this um you wouldn't be filling

1134
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,319
this out you know this would be a qsa

1135
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:39,359
company

1136
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:40,880
but they're going to charge you for this

1137
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,319
so i've heard some estimates it's going

1138
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:44,960
to be like 30 more to what you're paying

1139
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,000
right now for 4.0 um plus or minus you

1140
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,119
know with this um and then it's even

1141
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,119
more if you're doing customized approach

1142
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,119
so just keep that in mind that you know

1143
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,280
when this actually comes down into being

1144
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,800
implemented there's going to be some

1145
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,760
price hikes into it

1146
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,800
so lastly close up here um you know a

1147
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,160
little bit of pros and cons so the

1148
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,839
customized approach i like you know that

1149
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:09,520
gives a lot of flexibility to merchants

1150
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,119
and service providers to actually do

1151
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:12,880
some of this stuff some of the controls

1152
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,560
were actually improved you know to the

1153
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,480
way they implemented i think some of the

1154
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,880
stuff that you know like uh monitoring

1155
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,520
logs nobody really did it good manually

1156
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,520
so like just eliminate that you know

1157
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,000
type of thing um adding more monitoring

1158
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,839
capabilities which you know if you don't

1159
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:30,640
have a good monitoring program in place

1160
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,400
you know it's not if it's when

1161
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,640
oftentimes so adding more monitoring

1162
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,480
stuff into it i think is a good thing

1163
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,319
and it eliminates some of the qsa

1164
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:41,680
discretion if you was way back but i did

1165
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,920
a presentation on pci 3.0 one of my

1166
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,599
slides was actually

1167
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,920
slamming how bad it was of them doing

1168
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,520
periodically like they just added a

1169
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,359
whole bunch of work periodically words

1170
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:53,599
into it now with the targeted risk

1171
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:55,119
analysis they're at least taken out of

1172
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:57,839
the qsa's discretion and putting it back

1173
00:41:57,839 --> 00:41:59,680
into the company and saying here's what

1174
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,640
we think this means and here's our risk

1175
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,640
analysis to support that so that's a

1176
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,599
good thing

1177
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:06,560
um

1178
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,640
the cons are this going to be way more

1179
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,880
work from a documentation standpoint a

1180
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,800
number of controls are added

1181
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,319
it's going to be higher costs you know

1182
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:16,160
both from an internal resource and from

1183
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,920
external costs if you have to pay for

1184
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,440
that um

1185
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,960
and then you're adding control levels to

1186
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,560
the saqs that

1187
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,800
i think from a you know smaller company

1188
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,079
i've worked with companies that are like

1189
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:28,160
three people you know doing you know

1190
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,560
non-profit volunteer work and everything

1191
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,560
now you're asking them to go get an asv

1192
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,160
scan

1193
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,280
they're going to be lost and they're

1194
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,160
going to need a lot of help with this

1195
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,839
to do some of that stuff and everything

1196
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:41,359
so

1197
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:42,319
that's it

1198
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:44,640
so i made a notion site but that was way

1199
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,040
too long they both go to the same place

1200
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,040
so if you want to take pictures of that

1201
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,359
um yeah that's fine and actually i did

1202
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:53,760
not buy this domain just right now i've

1203
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,200
had this for like five years so

1204
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,760
but i figured i'd spare you the big hash

1205
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,760
at the end so

1206
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,000
yeah

1207
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,000
so the requirement to when you have to

1208
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,240
use 4-0 is march 31st 2024 that's when

1209
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,560
you have to well it's actually april 1st

1210
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,920
uh type of thing but you have until 2024

1211
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,160
to still use 3-2-1

1212
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,160
then you'll be required to use 4-0 and

1213
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,640
then the you have another year for those

1214
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,839
four dated controls to uh to implement

1215
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:31,440
those and everything

1216
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,040
if you're using like

1217
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,480
if you don't have those controls in

1218
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,400
place in that in between time it's not

1219
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,040
applicable if you put it there um if you

1220
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,319
don't have it in place if you have it in

1221
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:42,800
place you can just mark it uh in place

1222
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,599
so yep

1223
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,839
immediate is like today you can actually

1224
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:52,480
file with 4.0

1225
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,400
you know but a lot of people aren't

1226
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,000
choosing that because there's a lot of

1227
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,599
immediate controls like as soon as you

1228
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,880
file with the 4.0 templates um you have

1229
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,800
to do all those immediate controls you

1230
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,400
know type of thing um so that's why like

1231
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,400
nobody's really filing with 4.0 right

1232
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,560
now but there could be some later this

1233
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,319
year next year you know type of thing

1234
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:14,240
that you know as they're building up if

1235
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,359
they already have those all in place

1236
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:17,359
they'd be like okay yeah let's start the

1237
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:21,359
transition into that type of thing

1238
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:31,440
yeah so there there are a number of ones

1239
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,200
i'd actually uh recommend they have a

1240
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,040
summary of changes that they kind of

1241
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,720
break down

1242
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:40,079
yeah it's awful and honestly i

1243
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:42,079
i dove a lot into this for the

1244
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:44,079
presentation but

1245
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:45,680
every standard it always surprised me

1246
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,599
like they're like oh we just modified

1247
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:49,280
for clarity and then you look at the and

1248
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,480
you're like well that changes the

1249
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,960
definition you know type of thing i

1250
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,680
haven't seen too many of those you know

1251
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,400
uh as of now you know type of thing that

1252
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,240
really substantially change it to like

1253
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,920
oh man this is really in scope like one

1254
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,839
of the things they eliminated

1255
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:05,920
was the

1256
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,000
anti-malware should be on

1257
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
commonly affected they eliminated that

1258
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,440
verbage they basically said it should be

1259
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,319
on all systems except for the ones that

1260
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:16,400
like another controls except for the

1261
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,480
ones that aren't really you know done

1262
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,760
but you have to do a targeted risk

1263
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,119
analysis so

1264
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,920
kind of like it covers it under the the

1265
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,240
terms but they modify the verbiage you

1266
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:31,959
know type of thing um but yeah yeah

1267
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:40,160
yeah

1268
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:43,319
yep

1269
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:58,640
so they did a kind of a cloud guidance

1270
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:59,920
and it calls out some of the

1271
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,800
segmentation controls into there but pci

1272
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,040
does like they want to basically get

1273
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,800
hands off on technology and talking

1274
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,480
about that they basically talk about

1275
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:11,040
principles of like okay least privilege

1276
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,200
you know limited to only necessary you

1277
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,040
know traffic all that stuff and

1278
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,960
everything micro segmentation is great

1279
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,720
especially if you can automate the the

1280
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,079
maintenance of that you know type of

1281
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:21,839
thing but it really just comes down it's

1282
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:24,000
still segmentation at the end of the day

1283
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,440
you know into that um so yeah

1284
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,119
nothing directly but the guidance

1285
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,800
thought they made a cloud guidance

1286
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,640
document that comes the closest to that

1287
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,040
correct

1288
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:41,280
yep

1289
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,200
yeah

1290
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,640
yep

1291
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,200
so my recommendation on that if you are

1292
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,359
shopping around for qsas look for

1293
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:51,119
somebody that's very familiar with cloud

1294
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:54,160
technology you know i've seen some and

1295
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,920
nothing slamming you know a lot of that

1296
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,200
i've had like

1297
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,839
ex-cops come in and try to look at like

1298
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,160
my acquiring information on mainframe he

1299
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:02,960
never

1300
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,960
saw a mainframe before same thing goes

1301
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,000
for cloud like you get some qsas and

1302
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
sometimes if they're soft you know it's

1303
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,760
all right like okay here's our controls

1304
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,040
and as long as they're okay with it

1305
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,960
sometimes that's all right um but if

1306
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,480
they start giving you hard notes like i

1307
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,920
don't understand like how is it really

1308
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,559
segmented show me your acls it's like oh

1309
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:22,800
no the rules are right here oh i don't i

1310
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,319
don't see where it's allowing port

1311
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:26,480
whatever it's like well no you know type

1312
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,160
of thing that's where you need to make

1313
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,760
sure you have a good partner if they're

1314
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,640
assessing in your environment so

1315
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,119
okay out of time thank you everyone uh

1316
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:36,400
come and get me if you have any more

1317
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,400
questions
