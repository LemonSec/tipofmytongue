well they tell us most presentations

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,800
should start with a joke

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,800
i'm not going to do that today

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,760
i'm going to start my presentation with

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,160
a question that you would see

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,879
in the cissp

24
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,039
now the question is

25
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,879
listen carefully

26
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,438
what is a orange now don't answer this

27
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,119
question right now we're going to wait

28
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:08,400
and we're going to answer it during the

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,840
presentation

30
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,320
but your choices are it's a color

31
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,720
i forgot what the choices are

32
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,840
it's a stop sign

33
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,520
it's a fruit

34
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,520
or it's a traffic light so what is an

35
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,400
orange

36
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,720
and the choices are color stop sign

37
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,720
fruit or traffic light we're going to

38
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,200
come back to that question

39
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,560

40
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,240

before we start the presentation let me

123
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,639
give you a little bit of the legalese

124
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,880
basically the concepts were prov you

125
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,240
know where

126
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,960
we're showing here are nothing new um

127
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,039
academia has been using them for a

128
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,680
number of years but what we want to say

129
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,520
is that any kind of

130
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,600
opinion we express

131
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,560
does not represent ise square our

132
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,520
representative employers or any other

133
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,000
group these are our own opinions

134
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,120
that lisa and i have helped develop uh

135
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,320
in for a number of years now

136
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,960
why certify

137
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,400
according to isc square

138
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,080
a

139
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,039
baseline cissp will make a hundred and

140
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,600
thirty one thousand dollars

141
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,440
and you can see some peppermints on the

142
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,039
table that's a lot of peppermints

143
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,960
i know this screenshot's a little bit

144
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,720
small here but if you look at this heat

145
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,680
map from cyberseek.org

146
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,319
this was taken earlier in the week

147
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,919
you can see this is the pittsburgh

148
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:28,960
region

149
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,840
and

150
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,280
there are 743 openings looking for the

151
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,880
cissp that's in the highest number

152
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,199
of any other certification people want

153
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,080
to see the cissp

154
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,440
there are about 12 000 people employed

155
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,800
in the pittsburgh area in the cyber

156
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,199
security area

157
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,400
and about 8 200 job openings right now

158
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,800
so there's probably one job opening for

159
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,720
every three people

160
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,800
that are employed

161
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,120
that's that's a lot of openings i know a

162
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,520
lot of you uh during the opening remarks

163
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,599
said your company was hiring and a lot

164
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,639
of people are here just to hire today

165
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,639
so

166
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,360
what we want to do um lisa and i thought

167
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,160

170
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,400
more people into this field to help fill

171
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,319
these gaps

172
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,360
so

173
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,639
we we we continued doing the issc

174
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,919
study group um

175
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,639
to to help us and you know to stand out

176
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,520
among our peers

177
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,919
yeah so i'm going to talk about some of

178
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,039
the ise squared certifications that

179
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,199
are available there

180
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,759
most of them you need to have experience

181
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,039
in the field to you know get certified

182
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,240
but there is a new certification

183
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,120
for beginners that you can go for

184
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,440
to uh you know should prove to your

185
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,759
employer that you're able to learn and

186
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,919
and get into the cyber security field

187
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,599
until eventually you can go for one of

188
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,520
these other certifications

189
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,360
and

190
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,240
the certifications are in many different

191
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,039
areas you have the cissp which is in

192
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,280
leadership and operations

193
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,080
the sscp which is it administration

194
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,520
the cc

195
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,799
sp which is cloud security

196
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,799
the c c the c s s l p

197
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,039
these are all tongue twisters

198
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,080
which is uh software security even have

199
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,320
health care security and privacy which

200
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,279
is the hciss

201
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,360
or spp

202
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,080
and you have the cap

203
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,640
which is a risk management framework a

204
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,760
grc source certification so all of these

205
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,720
certifications can help you in whatever

206
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,360
area of security you're interested

207
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,160
and a lot of these certifications

208
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,200
that

209
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,120
if you get government jobs these are

210
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,120
certifications that they like you have

211
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,320
in those types of jobs

212
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,080
so anna why don't you tell us a little

213
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,279
bit more about the exam

214
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,399
sure

215
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,800
the cissp is an

216
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,720
adaptive exam

217
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,000
so what does that mean that means that

218
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,120
the questions you get are in order

219
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,640
you get the next question

220
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,440
automatically you can't tag any of your

221
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,920
questions you can't go back and answer

222
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,640
any of your questions

223
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,440
so once you answer it and submit it

224
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,240
it's submitted

225
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,480
there's no

226
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,040
minus points for answering wrong so make

227
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,440
sure you answer all your questions when

228
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,560
you do take the test

229
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,600
um

230
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,560
what happens also with the cissp

231
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,399
is for instance you get a

232
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,560
a question on threat models and say you

233
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,440
get a

234
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,839
question on the threat model stride you

235
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,920
get it wrong and it's going to come

236
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,240
right back and ask you about the threat

237
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,760
model pasta

238
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,839
yes there is a threat model called pasta

239
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,010
it's not spaghetti not spaghetti

240
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:24,959
[Laughter]

241
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,959
so basically you need to make sure you

242
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,079
understand

243
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,079
the concepts

244
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,399
you can't skip topics on the exam and

245
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,720
what we recommend people do is take a

246
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,200
look at the outline and make sure you

247
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,920
understand every single concept within

248
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,079
the outline and you'll see when we we

249
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,079
show some samples of things that we do

250
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:45,760
within our study group

251
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,760
how we make sure we hit every single

252
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,399
concept

253
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,519
you must score well enough in all eight

254
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,360
of these domains listed here

255
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,560
to be able to pass and an overall score

256
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,399
of 700 of a thousand points

257
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,279
now

258
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,040
there's been a lot of changes to the

259
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,680
cissp program some of you may remember

260
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,440
the ten domains

261
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,760
um that has switched over to eight

262
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,360
domains

263
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,640
and on

264
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,120
june 1st of this year

265
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,839
what cissp has done as is added 25

266
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,560
additional questions and an extra hour

267
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,959
those 25 additional questions are

268
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,240
unscored so they're basically untested

269
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,800
questions so sometimes you may look at a

270
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,720
question and you're going to be like

271
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,800
what the heck is this

272
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,560
don't worry it's probably an unscored

273
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,640
question just do your best and answering

274
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,279
it

275
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,680
and just think about what is an orange

276
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,880
to become certified you have to have

277
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,839
paid experience at least two uh

278
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,360
two of these

279
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,200
domains

280
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,839
typically you need five years experience

281
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,079
but you can cut one off if you do have a

282
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,959
master's degree

283
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,800
there are a ton of resources

284
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,480
for this test

285
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,800
it's been around a long time

286
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,040
right

287
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,560
this issue

288
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,920
yeah

289
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,200
okay so now we're going to give you a

290
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,360
little teaser and some secrets to

291
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,279
clearing this exam and some of these

292
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,320
secrets i learned when i went to a boot

293
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,000
camp that i went to

294
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,959
and

295
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,040
i also learned them from

296
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,440
other people when i was in study groups

297
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,040
i found a study group on facebook

298
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,480
cissp study group with luke ahmed and it

299
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,360
was a great great group to join and

300
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,360
these are some of the things i learned

301
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,279
think like a manager so when you're

302
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,200
taking the exam you want to make sure

303
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,279
you think from a management point of

304
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,880
view

305
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,519
another thing when you see the questions

306
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,760
on the test and if you see anything

307
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,560
about life safety or people in the

308
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,920
question

309
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,320
that's what comes first so that's most

310
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,079
likely going to be what the answer is

311
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,839
related to

312
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,200
then

313
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,920
it also on the test if you see

314
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,399
something with risk assessment in the

315
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,560
answer that's often an answer because

316
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,959
if you have to choose they'll have

317
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,360
answers that look good if it's like a

318
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,200
technical sort of question oh yeah

319
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,360
here's the answer but

320
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,279
if you come from a technical background

321
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,600
sometimes it's hard because you want to

322
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,680
solve the problem and you want to pick

323
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,079
that technical answer but most of the

324
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,240
time on the test the answers do a risk

325
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,600
assessment

326
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,079
so again you want to look at the answers

327
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,240
from the management perspective

328
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,600
and people

329
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,680
and processes will always trump

330
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,199
technology

331
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,040
answers on the test

332
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,800
you want to think about your end game

333
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,800
what is really needed

334
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,120
to be done to avert the risk

335
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,000
and maintain a security mindset the

336
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
technologies will come and go but the

337
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,040
principles of security won't change

338
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,440
you want to think about a security by

339
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,279
design approach when you're looking at

340
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,079
the questions and also

341
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,600
layered defense

342
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,240
when you're looking at the questions too

343
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,720
and anna's going to talk to us about

344
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,880
some of the low-cost resources that

345
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,839
we've

346
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,360
found

347
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,800
thank you lisa

348
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,920
these resources change all the time of

349
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,399
what is the best to find

350
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,839
if you notice at the beginning of our

351
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,440
slide and we're going to have it again

352
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,639
we have a qr codes we also have some qr

353
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,639
codes that we can pass out here if you

354
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:39,680
want one

355
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,920
let us know and we have a paper copy of

356
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,800
that

357
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,720
qr code probably at the end of the

358
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,320
presentation we'll go in the back and

359
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,040
hand those out

360
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,839
um

361
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,320
but these are some of the

362
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,760
the qr codes within the cissp world

363
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,880
there are a lot of superheroes i i hate

364
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,720
to start naming them

365
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,399
because

366
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,920
there's just so many

367
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,639
ones that have helped us immensely

368
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,360
personally on a personal level is luke

369
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,320
ahmed he runs a facebook group called

370

a manager it's available for free right

375
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,120
now with the one of the subscriptions i

376
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,680
think the kindle subscription

377
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,360
it's available for free many of these

378
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,440
books you'll find at the local library

379
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,279
you don't have to go buy it

380
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,839
look at it and see

381
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,839
if this is something you want or not

382
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,560
um

383
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,839
for a second yes brian

384
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,040
oh

385
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,120
like if yeah in college right now a lot

386
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,880
of this stuff you can look at stuff it

387
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,920
might cost

388
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,680
a person you know if it's by yourself

389
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,600
and you're not a student 500 a thousand

390
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,440
dollars a year you might get some of

391
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,519
that for free so if anybody's looking at

392
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,480
taking the exam any

393
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,000
that didn't hear ryan maybe in the back

394
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,720
basically what ryan is saying is that

395
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,959
there are a lot of resources out there

396
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,120
that are available to a student look

397
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,560
into them

398
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,720
they could be low-cost i know you dummy

399
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,120
the allegheny county library offers a

400
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,519
free tuition there with with just your

401
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,199
library card so go ahead and talk to

402
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:48,720
your librarian

403
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,959
you don't have to go out and buy a ton

404
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,759
of things for this test

405
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,120
that's not going to make it successful

406
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,800
there there's probably

407
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,480
a million different

408
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,639

on those books

412

443
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,280
this question about your materials

444
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,559
it it's

445
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,600
it's these types of things that

446
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,039
you know that really

447
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,280
help you

448
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,039
okay like part of

449
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,840
passing this test is going to come from

450
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,559
the academia world right

451
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,080
you need to know what kind of learner

452
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,679
you are

453
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,160
what we found is by running these study

454
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,120
groups

455
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,080
by

456
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,200
taking a presentation

457
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,600
creating your own presentation trying to

458
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,720
teach it to someone else and talking

459
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,640
through these topics and asking

460
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,280
questions and having a discussion with

461
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,160
others

462
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,440
it really helps you

463
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,919
be able to reinforce reinforce your

464
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,600
learning because even though some of

465
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,960
these things are academia

466
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,120
you're not actually just an active

467
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,679
learner you're usually an active learner

468
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,679
maybe with a visual learner with sensory

469
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,080
learning so you're usually parts of all

470
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,640
these types of learnings

471
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,600
and that's why we feel that you know

472
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,600
going through it with a study group

473
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,919
is a good way to get the exam

474
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,160
to pass the exam

475
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,559
especially when they participate right

476
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,919
when people participate it it helps yeah

477
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,640
and and people that have presented

478
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,679
and really participate in a group so far

479
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,840
i'm not counting our last

480
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,679
uh study group that just finished we

481
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,360
have one person that passed from that

482
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,080
group so far but

483
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,480
100 of the people that actively

484
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,640
participate and present

485
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,480
pass so far

486
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,679
so it's a 100

487
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,120
pass rate

488
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,960
now you know participating and just

489
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,520
doing it halfway doesn't get you there

490
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,600
it only gets you halfway but if you're

491
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,760
fully engaged you you do pass

492
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,280
so next we just wanted to show some of

493
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,880
the example slides that we had

494
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,320
from our study group and i presented on

495
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,200
the risk domain and actually i have a

496
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,559
whole deck of cissp slides because like

497
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,280
anna was talking about previously i'm

498
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,440
more of a visual learner so these

499
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,679
pictures help me and when i'm on the

500
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,400
exam they help me to picture

501
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,640
answers for certain things so that was

502
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,120
helpful for me so

503
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,000
here

504
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,280
i put this slide together and you'll see

505
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,880
like in the top here 1.6

506
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,120
develop document and implement security

507
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,880
policy standards procedures and

508
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,280
guidelines that's one of the topics in

509
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,480
the domain so on all the slides i put

510
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,799
the top the domain topic to make sure

511
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,360
that we covered the topic so when the

512
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,000
presenters are doing their slides they

513
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,640
take the outline of the chapter and kind

514
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,120
of go through those so this one was

515
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,280
about the policies and standards

516
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,880
hierarchy a lot of people don't

517
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,640
understand what's a policy what's the

518
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,520
standard what are procedures but this

519
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,280
kind of puts it together and shows you

520
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:36,000
the strategic versus the what's tactical

521
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:42,080
and another example slide i have here

522
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,679
is of risk management concepts you know

523
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,720
there's all these initials mtbf

524
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,039
mttf mtt or you know what does all that

525
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:53,840
mean

526
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,159
so i found a picture

527
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,039
and i put the picture up there to try to

528
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,360
tell me the story of what that means on

529
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,159
the slide so for me that helped me with

530
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,799
learning and we

531
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,039
as we did the study groups i presented

532
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,840
this a while ago and as we progressed

533
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,919
through the study groups we offered for

534
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,400
the people who wanted to present to use

535
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,280
some existing slides and then add in the

536
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,559
new things

537
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,840
that were from you know updated in the

538
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,679
presentation so they would add it and

539
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,000
then we would either present together or

540
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,159
they would present the slides and some

541
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,919
people just created their own slides

542
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,559
which is very helpful i think

543
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:35,360
so

544
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,919
anna let's talk about how we reinforce

545
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,240
learning here

546
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,480
sure

547
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,240
in the cyber security world you're not

548
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,120
alone

549
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,840
don't try to do this test alone i i've

550
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,000
talked and i've mentored some young

551
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,840
women they're like i don't want anybody

552
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,520
to know that i'm studying for this test

553
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,080
like why not well what if i don't pass

554
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,840
well you will pass

555
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,159
so you might as well go and get help

556
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,120
from other people

557
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,960
so basically

558
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,919
learn here we're using this uh what's

559
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,039
this word

560
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,200
not an acronym mnemonic

561
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,880
yeah learn

562
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,159
learn

563
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,320
be you know you first have to be exposed

564
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,080
to the new information

565
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,320
um then you have to encode it you have

566
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,760
to apply it you have to recall it and

567
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,919
don't give up that's

568
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,000
failure only happens if you give up if

569
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,760
you don't pass the exam yes it's an

570
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,240
expensive exam but don't give up just

571
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,520
try it again

572
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,559
many times many employers will pay for

573
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,120
that exam if you don't have

574
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,279
an employer that's paying for the exam

575
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,919
there are a lot of job openings go find

576
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:47,360
an employer that's going to pay for the

577
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,000
exam

578
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,440
ask them that when you're looking for a

579
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,080
job out there today

580
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,720
do you pay for a cissp exam you know

581
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,400
it's like well i'm not even sure how

582
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,080
much it is does anyone know eight

583
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,320
hundred dollars now uh is it eight

584
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,559
hundred i think so like 7.99 or

585
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,000
something like that

586
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,880
okay so um now i'm going to go into some

587
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,200
exam day tips

588
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,720
one of the things you want to do is you

589
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,640
want to arrive at the test center at

590
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,880
least 30 minutes before you even start

591
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,559
your exam

592
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,400
and to check in you'll make sure you

593
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,679
have two acceptable forms of id

594
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,159
provide your signature

595
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,799
submit a palm vein scan i mean that

596
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,279
you're signing your life away here

597
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,360
you have your photo taken but don't wear

598
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,440
hats or scarves or sunglasses or

599
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,720
anything like that because they want to

600
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,080
see your face

601
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,240
and you can't take any of those things

602
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,559
into the room because

603
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,159
in the room

604
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,000
you'll have to leave your belongings

605
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,640
outside there'll be a test administrator

606
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,640
in the room and they'll give you an

607
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,360
orientation they'll escort you to a

608
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,039
computer terminal

609
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,679
and if you need anything during the exam

610
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,400
you raise your hand and you alert them

611
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,400
if you have any problems you need a new

612
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,039
note board or you need to take a break

613
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,000
for any reason

614
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:09,520
you have to raise your hand and they'll

615
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,120
come help you

616
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,480
the other thing

617
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,880
you might want to bring ear plugs i

618
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,720
brought earplugs because

619
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,960
there's a could be distractions around

620
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,760
you so that was helpful for me

621
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,880
and

622
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,799
you'll see on the

623
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:27,840
tables here we have

624
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,679
and peppermints

625
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,760
are are one of the keys

626
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,400
that you need to pass this exam

627
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,000
when you're studying you want to eat

628
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,520
peppermints it helps you to focus and it

629
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,880
helps people to concentrate better so it

630
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,960
might even reduce your anxiety but

631
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,960
that's why we brought the peppermint so

632
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,200
anyone who's going to take the exam

633
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,320
please grab a peppermint off the table

634
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,200
and

635
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,679
make sure when you're taking the exam

636
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,640
you read the questions thoroughly

637
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,600
read the answers i took the approach

638
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,240
where i read the answers and then i read

639
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,080
the question and then i read the answers

640
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,279
again and you can usually eliminate two

641
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,480
of the answers

642
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,799
and then you have a 50 50 chance of

643
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,840
getting that answer right

644
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:16,640
so

645
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,240
our lovely volunteer just brought me a

646
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,039
peppermint lisa oh nice

647
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,600
where's my peppermint

648
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,960
anna

649
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,400
do you want to talk about

650
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,679
some of the test taking tips here

651
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,120
yes

652
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,959
definitely budget your time

653
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,840
the one thing that has caught some

654
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,240
people off guard is at the beginning of

655
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,720
the test there's an nda basically you

656
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,640
can't talk about what questions are on

657
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,480
the test et cetera

658
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,360
um

659
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,200
you only have five minutes to accept

660
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,279
that when you go to the testing center

661
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,720
you basically get just a blank piece of

662
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,720
paper with like a sharpie or something

663
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,720
to write on

664
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,480
and a lot of people are like i want to

665
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,039
write the osi model down and i want to

666
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,799
write this down you know while still

667
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,480
fresh on my mind even before i start my

668
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,640
test i want to write all this stuff down

669
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,080
and they don't realize that they need to

670
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,000
um

671
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,559
you know accept that nda agreement the

672
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,480
first thing you do when you go take your

673
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,120
test is go in and accept that mda

674
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,760
agreement i've heard of several people

675
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,200
that have missed that five-minute

676
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,600
opportunity so don't let that be you

677
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,320
read the question carefully to determine

678
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,918
what it's actually looking for

679
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,919
determine the correct answer try to

680
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,399
think about it in your head before you

681
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,799
you look at the answer

682
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,240
you've read through them you kind of

683
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,240
know what the answers already are and

684
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,360
when you when you're reading the

685
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,039
question which one do you think it is

686
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,000
before re-looking at that answer

687
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,480
and we read those carefully

688
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,799
uh and select the best answers so back

689
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:02,480
to the question

690
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,080
what is a orange

691
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,960
what is a orange does anybody know what

692
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,320
an orange is

693
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,520
you're going to give them the choices

694
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,840
again go ahead i'm going to go ahead and

695
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,640
it's a fruit

696
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,919
right answer

697
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:23,279
it's a fruit because i'm saying what is

698
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,279
a orange

699
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:26,960
if that question was asked a different

700
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,760
way

701
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,039
it may be

702
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,760
a color and this is basically a lot of

703
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,880
the questions on the exam are like this

704
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,360
where two of them are just

705
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,640
off

706
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,080
they're not close

707
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,600
but two of them are really close and

708
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,080
both can be correct but you have to pick

709
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,360
the most correct answer

710
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,880
so

711
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,320
what's the correct answer tori

712
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,480
do risk assessment

713
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,039
yes yes about we have to do risk

714
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,039
assessment and figure out if it's an

715
00:28:59,039 --> 00:28:59,410
orange

716
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:01,919
[Laughter]

717
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,010
all right i like that

718
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:07,680
[Laughter]

719
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,200
okay here's the qr code that we promised

720
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,960
if you take a picture of this qr code

721
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,440
again we'll have some handouts at the

722
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,559
back of the room at the end of the

723
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,600
presentation here

724
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,360
but um

725
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,640
can everybody get the picture

726
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,200
is it working for you

727
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,360
we'll keep this updated going forward

728
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:33,679
qr codes

729
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:35,840
they trust us

730
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,640
yeah

731
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,200
qr codes can be did you did you do a

732
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,039
risk assessment before you did that on

733
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,440
your phone

734
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,159
so

735
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:53,000
anyone have any questions here

736
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,880
questions if we don't have questions we

737
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,399
did we did have some quotes from people

738
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,799
in our study group eric are you here

739
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:06,158
where did you leave us

740
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,960
so we told eric we would make him come

741
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,159
on stage i he was on stage earlier for

742
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,000
opening remarks i think we scared him

743
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,440
away

744
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,360
but

745
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,120
he's on the other side right now yeah so

746
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,679
we have some quotes from people who who

747
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:22,720
did

748
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,640
take the exam that

749
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,039
we put up here austin i don't want to

750
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:28,580
read them all there so long

751
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,919
[Laughter]

752
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:30,880
but

753
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,679
we we do have some shorter quotes but we

754
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:35,840
have quotes from people who actually

755
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,440
took the

756
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,200
class to study

757
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,000
and then quotes from some of our mentors

758
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,080
in the class

759
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,120
which

760
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,640
are probably a little shorter here

761
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,440
yeah this is our mentor slide yeah this

762
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,840

come on up come on up front

799
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,200
yeah i just want to mention that it

800
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,720
seemed like a lot of people here were

801
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,799
interested in taking the exam so if

802
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,480
you're just even on the fence come to

803
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,720
study group and then see if it's for you

804
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,240
so i mean it's what you typically do

805
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,440
monday or tuesday nights

806
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,960
yeah it's usually a good time for people

807
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,240
to make so if you're like i've been

808
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,760
thinking about it like this is a really

809
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,279
good way to do it and then if it's one

810
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,320
of those things you do it you're like

811
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,760
you know what i just don't want to well

812
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,080
then that's fine too but i think i say

813
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,519
if you're like i've been thinking about

814
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,519
doing this come to one of the

815
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,039
the meetings give it a try and then see

816
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,440
if it's for you strongly encourage that

817
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,919
yeah it's also a good way of networking

818
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:00,320
and you do meet people in different

819
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,440
areas of security so i know me i've

820
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,840
learned a lot from the people in the

821
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,720
group and you know just the different

822
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,720
areas of security they work in the

823
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,480
domains

824
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,720
