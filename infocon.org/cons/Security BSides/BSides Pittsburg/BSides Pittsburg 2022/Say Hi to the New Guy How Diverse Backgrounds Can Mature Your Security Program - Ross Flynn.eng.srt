she encourages me to do these types of

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,640
talks she encourages me to

24
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,440
continue my knowledge in this field and

25
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,079
i can't do this without her support so i

26
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,600
always like to give her

27
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,559
credit

28
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,640
i'm a hot sauce connoisseur and by that

29
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,640
i mean i loved hot sauce so much that i

30
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,640

33
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,040
love to talk your ear off about it

34
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,000
escape room expert it's a bold claim but

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,840
i've done enough to say that i've done

36
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,439
20 and i got a 90 success rate so it's

37
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,960
close enough to me

38
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,200
um and i'm a musician

39
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,200
i played music through college to help

40
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,880
pay my way through college which should

41
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,520
go under my non-infosec history but

42
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,759
it's not

43
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,759
credentials some people this matters too

44
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,439
some people couldn't care less but i

45
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,840
like to throw them up there

46
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,000
my non-infosec histories where things

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,399
get a bit more interesting

48
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,119
prior to coming into infosec

49
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,880
i was a dorm mom

50
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,000
which meant that it was my

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,840
responsibility to

52
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,960
be

53
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,320
at the the house there were 16 chinese

54
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,240
students and one korean student that

55
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,320
lived in a house together and

56
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,240
the middle of the state

57
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,840
my role was to make sure they all got

58
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,040
off the bus

59
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,719
i made dinner made sure they were doing

60
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,399
their homework checked in on them all of

61
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:07,920
that fun stuff and i was just

62
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,080
responsible for

63
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,599
making sure that they were doing what

64
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,120
they needed to do

65
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,080
after that i was a truck driver i did

66
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,840
that for

67
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,599
i think on and off for about five years

68
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,599
for moving companies so

69
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,680
i would put my moving numbers up against

70
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,360
anybody here to say that i have done

71
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,280
more moves than you and i hate moving

72
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,879
more than you do

73
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,239
we can challenge that later

74
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,760
20 states in four countries that sounds

75
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,620
like a good july for me

76
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,640
[Music]

77
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,680
[Laughter]

78
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,160
after that i was a logistics coordinator

79
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,640
for a company called tough mudder so my

80
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,840
role was to go tough mudder is a 10 mile

81
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,720
obstacle course so a mud run so i would

82
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,560
go to the state whatever state we were

83
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,239
going to i'd go to the

84
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,080
set up for the event

85
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,120
i would coordinate with vendors with djs

86
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,120
with the the course crew all of that

87
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,879
stuff so it's just event operations

88
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,159
really

89
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,720
which was cool had a great time saw 37

90
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,599
states in just under 9 months put 30 000

91
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,280
miles on my car

92
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,000
slept in my car way more often than i

93
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,680
should have

94
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,280
and then finally when i did get my

95
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,920
degree i became a family counselor i was

96
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,159
in the child welfare system doing what

97
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,560
was called family preservation

98
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,560
so my role was to assess a family the

99
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,720
children youth and families would get a

100
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,920
referral

101
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,120
my role was to see can that house be

102
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,440
become a safe place for a child

103
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,319
i worked independently with kids worked

104
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,840
with their families together worked with

105
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,959
parents i did couples counseling um 10

106
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,200
out of 10 would not recommend 0 to 10

107
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,959
would not recommend being the counselor

108
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,879
in that if if you want to do couples

109
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,879
counseling i highly recommend it just

110
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,319
don't recommend being the counselor in

111
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,840
there

112
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,200
but it was

113
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,280
a lot of learning

114
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,599
i have leaned on my experience as a

115
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,519
counselor many many times throughout my

116
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,319
infosec history and you'll we'll talk a

117
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,319
bit about that but

118
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,959
after that i decided i wanted a change

119
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,560
um something that was a little less

120
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,040
emotionally taxing a little bit more

121
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,639
mentally challenging

122
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,040
and i had no

123
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,040
no background in i.t no background in

124
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,160
infosec i didn't know what i was doing

125
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,000
and when i decided i wanted to make a

126
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,960
change i had a friend that said hey you

127
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,199
know it's always hiring i.t is always

128
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,400
teaching

129
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,160
and i didn't really know what the

130
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,320
difference was between it i just thought

131
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,160
of it as i.t and that's everything

132
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,320
computer related and i had no experience

133
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,000
with it

134
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,080
but i started he said i can get you an

135
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,120
interview

136
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,680
setting up servers if you can show that

137
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,280
you're interested so i said how do i

138
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,600
show i'm interested and he said start

139
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,520
studying for your a plus and i said

140
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,759
what's an a plus um

141
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,240
so he introduced me to comptia and i

142
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,800
started studying for my eight my a plus

143
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,400
while i was doing

144
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,919
all of my counseling work so in the

145
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,919
evenings i would study during the day i

146
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,479
would do my my normal job

147
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,320
and so i went to go take my a plus so

148
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,000
that i could go nail this interview

149
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,880
failed my a plus

150
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,800
wasn't thrilled about that but it did

151
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,600
not deter me i went on to

152
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,960
go to this interview and told them i

153
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,400
didn't get this but i'm going to try

154
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,919
really hard and i'm going to figure it

155
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,440
out and they said that's enough you

156
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,199
showed the interest

157
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,440
so my first it role was in

158
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,479
setting up these servers in the

159
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,400
pittsburgh library system

160
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,479
and i was setting up servers removing

161
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,960
old ones didn't know really what i was

162
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,240
doing except

163
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,240
just plug something in and unplug it but

164
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,680
i had people around me that were willing

165
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,120
to teach me and i started learning

166
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,280
you'll you'll hear a theme about this uh

167
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,880
throughout my whole talk but

168
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,160
i think we need people that are hungry

169
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,280
for this field and that are very

170
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,039
interested in this field and that want

171
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,479
to better themselves um and i tried to

172
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,080
embody that

173
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,919
so a bit about my infosec i moved from

174
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,800
there into a cloud security internship

175
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,039
um i guess my

176
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,039
experience on this team was enough that

177
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,639
it impressed somebody and they were

178
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,960
willing to take a shot on me so i did a

179
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,880
an unpaid internship for a couple months

180
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,520
doing cloud security um

181
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,759
moved from there i got a my hisp

182
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,600
certification up there and that was

183
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,639
enough for ppg to take a look at me and

184
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,520
i started my uh started working on their

185
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,120
iam team

186
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,919
did that for a couple couple or

187
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,840
really about a year

188
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,440
and then i moved into their internal

189
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,800
audit team where i got to see more of

190
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,680
the grc side which then turned into the

191
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,240
risk management side

192
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,759
and then following that all my

193
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,400
experience my

194
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,720
random different experiences

195
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,560
turned up into me coming to echelon

196
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,639
echelon we are a pittsburgh based cyber

197
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,759
security firm we kind of

198
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,599
we really believe

199
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:06,720
in the

200
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,039
we call it the every human has a right

201
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,039
to privacy and security

202
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,039
and when it was shared to me that vision

203
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,560
i thought that was like the coolest

204
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,800
vision because i've grown this love for

205
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,240
security

206
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,160
so we are broken up into our offensive

207
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,680
security team and those are our pen

208
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,520
testers i'm

209
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,599
just constantly impressed with

210
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,160
the level of knowledge those guys have

211
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,360
they're always learning something new

212
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,960
always developing and contributing to

213
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,120
the infosec community

214
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,720
we have our defensive security team and

215
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,800
those are the guys that have uh hands-on

216
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,479
keyboard they're doing the hardening

217
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,160
they're doing um

218
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,360
firewalls

219
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,479
everything that you would kind of

220
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,319
traditionally associate with the the

221
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,240
blue team side

222
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,919
and then we have audits assessments and

223
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,080
compliance that's my side of the house

224
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,720
the best side of the house

225
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,080
subjectively

226
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,080
anything that you can imagine

227
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,160
audit related assessments we do a lot in

228
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,759
the healthcare space

229
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,680
we do a lot with business continuity

230
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,759
disaster recovery

231
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,400
i really enjoy what i do

232
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,199
comprehensively all of this we do a vcso

233
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,720
service where we can we act as a cso for

234
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,720
an organization or we just lay out what

235
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,000
you want to accomplish for the year and

236
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,280
how we can help you accomplish it

237
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,440
so enough about echelon enough about me

238
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,639
i want to talk to you about why does

239
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,560
this topic matter what is

240
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,479
why does it matter

241
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:29,840
that we have these different backgrounds

242
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,440
in the field and i think there are a few

243
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,360
reasons

244
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,240
one is we have more applicants incoming

245
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,799
than we've ever seen before

246
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,640
we have unprecedented numbers of

247
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,799
applicants into the field

248
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,320
and there's a lot of reason i think for

249
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,600
that we're gonna we're gonna talk about

250
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,519
that um

251
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,279
there's really great experience out

252
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,720
there that we're not tapping into when

253
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,720
we look at traditional means and one

254
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,640
thing i want to point out that i usually

255
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,480
say before i get started

256
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,160
the argument that i'm going to make

257
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,399
today i'm not saying that people that

258
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,480
come from a more traditional background

259
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,279
through a cyber security degree or i.t

260
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,519
degree are any less

261
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,880
valued

262
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,120
farthest thing from what i want to get

263
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,360
across really what i want to share is

264
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,080
just that we have a lot of opportunities

265
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,440
for people that may not have that

266
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,720
experience

267
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,120
but there is great experience out there

268
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,279
we really need in this field critical

269
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,600
thinkers we need leaders we need problem

270
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,920
solvers and we need lifelong learners

271
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,040
people that want to be doing this

272
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,880
we just need good people

273
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,120
our current rate of growth in the field

274
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,560
isn't sustainable for the deficit that

275
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,839
we have

276
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,519
the isc squared shows a

277
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:42,640
2.72 million

278
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,640
person gap in the cyber security

279
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,240
workforce

280
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,680
another study from cyber security

281
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,279
ventures shows a three and a half

282
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,399
million

283
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,839
personnel

284
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,519
deficit

285
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,200
and the numbers recently are showing

286
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,839
about 45 000 graduates coming out of

287
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,080
college with a cyber security degree

288
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,120
each year

289
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,600
and those numbers don't add up so we

290
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,079
need more people that are willing and

291
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,560
interested in this field so

292
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,640
i pose the idea that we should be

293
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,800
looking in areas where we may not have

294
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,120
before

295
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,760
so let's hop into the agenda we're going

296
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,519
to talk about why people are switching

297
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,720
careers

298
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,160
what can these non-traditional

299
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,760
backgrounds offer

300
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,839
what qualities can we expect from them

301
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,399
and how do we support our industry

302
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,399
transplants

303
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,519
first thing i want to cover here is why

304
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,040
are we getting so many new people in the

305
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,800
field and i think that's a loaded

306
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,399
question

307
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,200
a big portion of that of course is the

308
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,640
kobit pandemic

309
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,399
uh covet has changed everything i don't

310
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,959
have to tell you that but i think for

311
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,120
our field in infosec

312
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,800
we are seeing

313
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,560
the um

314
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,800
way more remote work than we've seen in

315
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,839
the past

316
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,519
i think a lot of us knew that our roles

317
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,920
could be done remotely and it may not be

318
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,600
your experience that you're doing your

319
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,680
work remotely now but there are way more

320
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,680
remote positions than there ever have

321
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,200
ever been

322
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,720
and we're seeing it become more of the

323
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,760
norm

324
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,760
we have this integration of work and

325
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,959
life where it often times now isn't a

326
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,440
nine to five it's a

327
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,399
uh nine to nine it might be a nine to

328
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,600
eleven and then you take your dog to the

329
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,360
the dog daycare center i just learned

330
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,279
that was a thing recently uh you take

331
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,000
your dog to the daycare center at 11 and

332
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,360
then you have lunch at noon and then you

333
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,600
work from one to three and then you get

334
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,800
dinner ready

335
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,279
and then you work from five to seven and

336
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,800
things are just becoming

337
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,720
we're losing some of that work life

338
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,920
separation

339
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,240
which has good and bad to it but we're

340
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,240
seeing this integration now of work and

341
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,079
life

342
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,600
and a lot of that is due to the remote

343
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,800
work

344
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,480
so i think that's a portion people are

345
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,639
seeing that we they can work remotely

346
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,160
there's some appeal to that it's not for

347
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,399
everybody but a lot of people want to

348
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,399
we have the great resignation as it's

349
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,920
being called

350
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,480
in november of last year there were four

351
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,639
million people that quit their jobs and

352
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,920
that is the highest number i think in

353
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,000
it's either ever or in 50 years i can't

354
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,680
remember which but it is a very high

355
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,680
number that four million people quit

356
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,639
their job

357
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,639
just in november of last year

358
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,360
and of course those aren't all infosec

359
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,120
people but they're a part of it

360
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,600
there's a poll that i was reading about

361
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,480
why are people specifically an infosec

362
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,399
leaving their careers or leaving their

363
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,320
roles and the things that kept getting

364
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,760
brought up were work-life balance a lack

365
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,880
of respect

366
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,959
a lack of challenge and compensation

367
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,560
expectations

368
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,519
so

369
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,160
we have within the field people moving

370
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,959
we have this idea that

371
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,399
i can work remotely

372
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,639
there's the potential for more growth so

373
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,560
i think that's a draw

374
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,000
and then societal changes we talked

375
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,839
about the great resignation

376
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,160
currently the last study i read said

377
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,560
that 27 of degree holders have a

378
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,399
position in their field of study

379
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,360
which means good for those 27 percent

380
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,320
but those other 73 percent i hope that

381
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,160
math is right are

382
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,880
not in their field

383
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,519
of course me with my bs in crisis

384
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,160
counseling i i fall into that so

385
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,680
we're having a lot of career transition

386
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,519
and then the rollback of requirements is

387
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,839
another one that we're seeing

388
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,399
less emphasis put upon degrees more

389
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,160
emphasis put upon

390
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,839
whether there be certifications just

391
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,760
experience or willingness to learn

392
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,600
so why this field i think because it's

393
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,240
the best job in the world of course

394
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,760
according to google

395
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,839
i actually googled this once and it says

396
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,440
information security analyst if you

397
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,040
can't see that from the way all the way

398
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,000
back there is the number one best job

399
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,360
and i'm sure we can all have a good

400
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,160
chuckle about that

401
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,560
but i think there's some very real

402
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,680
things

403
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,240
that draw people to this field the

404
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,160
accessibility of information i'll tell

405
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,920
you that was what drew me

406
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,440
one of the big things

407
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,760
if i were to stay in my counseling role

408
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,160
i would have had to go get my master's

409
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,199
next after i had my my counseling degree

410
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,959
i would have had to get

411
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,000
more

412
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,160
licensed i'd have to go get my licensure

413
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,440
and then i would have in order to get

414
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,680
that out to put in a certain amount of

415
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,160
hours of counseling practice and i think

416
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,160
those are all good requirements

417
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,320
but it's a lot and it's a lot of money

418
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,519
and

419
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,519
me and my role at the time i was already

420
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,600
burnt out seeing some of the

421
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,120
worst of the worst

422
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,360
situations with some of these kids i

423
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,519
couldn't bring myself to continue doing

424
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,480
it

425
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,160
so when i was considering changing

426
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,079
fields

427
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,160
i saw the accessibility of information i

428
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,839
just googled what is

429
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,079
cyber security what is hacking and i

430
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,839
found youtube videos

431
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,160
um there are so many videos out there

432
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,519
that you can learn from you've got the

433
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,399
the john hammonds uh the cody kinsey's

434
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,639
professor messer there are just so many

435
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,399
places to learn from that are free

436
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,120
resources not even including the plural

437
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,680
sites um things like security blue team

438
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,120
like there are just so many

439
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,720
opportunities

440
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,399
the credentialing is another thing you

441
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,120
can get a certification in this field

442
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,320
some of them i mean i mean there's a

443
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,880
cost associated but we're not dropping

444
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,519
you know 40 grand into or 60 grand into

445
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,360
a master's program

446
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,040
there's a level of self-investment in

447
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,880
some of these courses

448
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,320
it might be a couple hundred it might be

449
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,680
a grand but

450
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,040
it's definitely more attainable

451
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,279
i think there's also a perceived

452
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,680
stability in this field because we're

453
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,279
all over the news all the time people

454
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,279
hear about ransomware they hear about

455
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,920
the latest hack it sounds cool to people

456
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,959
and they just want to get involved

457
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,800
and there's a heck of a lot of projected

458
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,680
growth our field has a 28

459
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,320
projected growth through 2026

460
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,480
which is great for us but as we said

461
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,600
there is this deficit of

462
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,639
qualified professionals

463
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,040
another thing i think that attracts

464
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,199
people so i heard somebody say it

465
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,440
earlier that they another speaker said

466
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,199
that they were on another team like an

467
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,519
architecture team or may have even been

468
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,519
a legal team

469
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,480
but infosec is so interdisciplinary that

470
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,839
we're touching every facet of the

471
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:24,959
company now

472
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,639
your cyber security team has to work

473
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:27,680
with

474
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,440
complaints they have to work with legal

475
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,320
they have to work with

476
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,160
finance so

477
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,600
what i have seen through some of this

478
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,240
conversation i've had presenting this is

479
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,560
that people tell me they were

480
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,800
an auditor that wasn't even i.t related

481
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,880
but they were interested in it because

482
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,519
they they saw the i.t aspect or they

483
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,920
were a business analyst that just worked

484
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,399
with an application maybe an erp

485
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,360
and

486
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,440
they talked to one of the cyber security

487
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,160
people and they thought it was

488
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,160
interesting so we're seeing people from

489
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,800
these different backgrounds becoming

490
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,399
interested in our field because they

491
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,480
worked with somebody in the field

492
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,880
and as i said it just sounds cool

493
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,559
the other thing i think that is

494
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,640
very compelling for this field is the

495
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,880
breadth of options

496
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,839
this comes from henry zhang at diligent

497
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,880
and it gets updated every couple years

498
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,039
i get so excited when i look at this

499
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,280
because i'll be like oh man i really

500
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,640
know this this one bcpdr i know that and

501
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,240
i know the crisis management and stock

502
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,600
one suck two

503
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,400
uh i don't know threat intelligence i

504
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,720
don't really know this um

505
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,400
well i do know that one

506
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,280
i i

507
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,039
i don't know certain aspects of this for

508
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,760
sure and i get intimidated but i get

509
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,080
excited at the same time

510
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,520
because there's so many different ways

511
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,679
that you can go in this field

512
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,360
and it's just continuing to grow and

513
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,440
grow so i think that's one of the things

514
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,440
that is absolutely bringing people to

515
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,039
our field is how

516
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,559
many options they have once they get in

517
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,200
so of course you're going to ask well

518
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,720
what are these people that don't have a

519
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,480
traditional background what can they

520
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,440
offer

521
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,840
i think that's a very valid question

522
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,720
i think

523
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,320
that they will offer a couple things but

524
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,160
the three that stick out to me are a new

525
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,440
perspective

526
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,000
they're going to offer a cultural impact

527
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,360
and they're going to offer qualities

528
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,440
necessary for success

529
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,880
which is very vague but we're going to

530
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,440
dive into it

531
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,440
from the prospective side

532
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,320
they're going to offer what we don't get

533
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,280
to see as often the end user the

534
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,679
the business as we call them i'm sure

535
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,160
many of you have had the it versus the

536
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,000
business argument

537
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,360
they're going to offer

538
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,880
the perspective of the business they're

539
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,760
going to offer why do these people keep

540
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,679
clicking on these emails even though we

541
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,120
go we've gone through the security

542
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,799
awareness training so many times and

543
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,400
they still click on it they're going to

544
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,640
offer some perspective into that

545
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,880
when we tell a

546
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,880
business function you cannot use that

547
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,280
app because they have terrible

548
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,760
third-party risk management controls

549
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,919
and they're insistent upon using it

550
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,760
they're going to offer the perspective

551
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,960
about why

552
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,880
they want to continue using it now

553
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,039
there's are very specific examples but i

554
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,960
think they apply to a lot of different

555
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,559
situations

556
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,880
so one of the things i really value is

557
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,559
the level of perspective that they're

558
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,000
going to bring

559
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,039
i think

560
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,120
we have historically and this is

561
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,960
changing but we've approached

562
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,919
our problems in a very

563
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,760
just the same way over and over you know

564
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,039
we've we've

565
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,640
used the same controls we've used the

566
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,280
same processes because they haven't been

567
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,280
challenged and somebody coming from

568
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,720
outside is going to have a different

569
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,520
perspective on that

570
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,760
i really love the if the only tool you

571
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,240
have is a hammer it's tempting to treat

572
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,160
everything as if it were a nail

573
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,840
because we can't keep

574
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,200
addressing things the same way that

575
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,640
we've been so

576
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,840
definitely going to bring some new

577
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,440
perspective i think they're going to

578
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,200
bring cultural impact

579
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,400
and cultural impact is

580
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,799
that is loaded

581
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,880
i frequently have conversations when i'm

582
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,039
in the process of hiring or talking to

583
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,559
people that are hiring about well are

584
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,559
they going to fit the culture and what

585
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,400
i'm not hearing nearly as much and i

586
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,400
think we need to be considering is not

587
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,919
only are they going to fit our culture

588
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,200
but are they going to improve our

589
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,400
culture

590
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,200
i can reference a couple positions that

591
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,799
i've held where

592
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,880
continual learning was not

593
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,880
the was not really encouraged it wasn't

594
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,760
discouraged by any means but it wasn't

595
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,799
encouraged to go get a certification it

596
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,360
wasn't encouraged to

597
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,200
go to a conference like these sides and

598
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,880
network with people and see different

599
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,640
sides of the field

600
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,919
so

601
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,760
my hope and when i've when i've talked

602
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,919
to colleagues from that those roles my

603
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,600
hope is that i improved that culture by

604
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,520
my desire to learn

605
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,679
one role in particular

606
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:52,480
we

607
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,400
didn't we didn't really have anybody

608
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,200
telling us go work on your security plus

609
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,280
go work on anything

610
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,840
but we decided to anyway so we would

611
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,840
book a conference room over lunch and we

612
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,840
would do study sessions together

613
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,400
and my hope is that that is an aspect of

614
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,000
us improving the culture while we were

615
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,559
there because by the end we had more

616
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,799
well-rounded security professionals we

617
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,640
had people that were interested in it

618
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,720
more than just what we had to do for

619
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,320
work but we started to develop this

620
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,960
hunger for it

621
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,799
so we talked about the the different

622
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,799
ways to approach the problem

623
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,080
the opportunity i think they're going to

624
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,919
it's easy in this field

625
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,679
to get stagnant because it's called

626
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,039
always changing and we are

627
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,200
it's hard to keep up i think in a

628
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,480
culture especially that has some

629
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,080
stagnating people if you bring in

630
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,280
somebody that doesn't have the

631
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,200
experience and they're already in this

632
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,200
learning process they're obviously here

633
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,039
because they want to be here

634
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,640
they're here because they've started the

635
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,320
learning and they want to continue it

636
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,799
and i think that kind of

637
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,400
gumption is the word i know it's an old

638
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,720
school word but that kind of gumption is

639
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,120
going to be

640
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,600
a spark for some of your stagnating

641
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,600
teammates or even yourself if you find

642
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,120
yourself you've been in here for a long

643
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,320
time

644
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,880
and you're starting to get tired of it

645
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,400
the young blood the new blood that's

646
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,919
coming in that wants to learn that's

647
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:14,880
eager

648
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,320
they're going to be looking for

649
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,400
opportunities to take classes they're

650
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,799
going to be looking for courses to take

651
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,080
they're going to be looking to you for

652
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,960
leadership and that kind of onus on you

653
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,400
to be a leader

654
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,679
and that kind of

655
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,280
inspiration that comes from somebody

656
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,039
else wanting to better themselves i

657
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,880
think can make a

658
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,559
crazy

659
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,158
positive impact to a culture

660
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,039
so outside of the perspective in the

661
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,159
learning culture i think they're going

662
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,520
to bring some methods they're going to

663
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,120
bring tools and some tactics habits both

664
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,320
good and bad

665
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,400
which is of course a double-edged

666
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,480
double-edged sword

667
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,320
an example for me i had a colleague that

668
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,520
came from a manufacturing company

669
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,080
and he i was in audit

670
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,679
he came to the audit team we were

671
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,000
talking about how to review terminated

672
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,760
users and he said hey i have this excel

673
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,240
macro it's a it's a version of a fuzzy

674
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,000
lookup and i was like well how does it

675
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,840
work and he showed me and it was the

676
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,840
perfect tool for us to be able to

677
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,520
test terminated users

678
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,520
so after he left i still use that i used

679
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,679
that for years after that because it was

680
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,760
a perfect tool that wasn't developed for

681
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,720
audit

682
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,720
but it had a great application so i

683
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,600
think

684
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,080
that's a prime example of somebody that

685
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,000
didn't come from um they came from

686
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,760
manufacturing like the the production

687
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,039
line and they were able to teach me

688
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,360
something

689
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,640
good habits

690
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,400
i tend to think that people that are

691
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,720
coming into this field they have to have

692
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,840
some

693
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,600
a certain set of qualities

694
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,679
and we're going to talk about that but

695
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:52,640
i think they're going to bring in some

696
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,200
really great habits hopefully

697
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,640
and these are things to look for but

698
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,279
communication skills it's a key one

699
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,960
right we need to be able to communicate

700
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,000
with people

701
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,440
they're going to bring in

702
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,480
potentially some organizational

703
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,640
habits

704
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,559
some of you i.t people are like the

705
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,080
messiest people i've ever met and

706
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,640
disorganized and i say you to try to

707
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,799
project because i mean it about myself

708
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,440
we can often be very disorganized and i

709
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,600
have met some people similar to me but

710
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,600
came back from different backgrounds and

711
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,200
helped me figure out how to organize my

712
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,640
life

713
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,919
so i think we're going to bring in some

714
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:29,360
good habits i think there's some bad

715
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,600
habits that they're going to bring in

716
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,679
like not locking their computer when

717
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,360
they walk away and things that we're

718
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,520
going to slowly start working on and

719
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,559
that's fine that's we're all human um

720
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,640
but i think that they're going a lot of

721
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,679
people that are going to come in from

722
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,240
this field are going to be able to

723
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,159
improve your culture you just need to be

724
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,400
intentional about who you're picking

725
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,600
right so

726
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,200
how do you do that

727
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,159
i think you look for certain qualities

728
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,520
and i think these qualities in

729
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,880
particular

730
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,520
are going to be consistent across pretty

731
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,320
much

732
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,640
any person coming from a non-traditional

733
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,799
background into this field

734
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:07,760
because

735
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,600
you can't do that without these so

736
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,200
perseverance

737
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,880
refusing to give up

738
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,559
on thriving in the field despite the

739
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,000
rejection despite the failure on the

740
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,440
roadblocks

741
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,360
i told you some of my success stories i

742
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,360
had a lot of rejections before that i

743
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,039
had a lot of people that

744
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,880
said i don't have any experience and

745
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,480
they were right i didn't

746
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,400
but i went on to show that given the

747
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,640
opportunity i can do this and i see this

748
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,520
across other people that uh one of the

749
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,120
gentlemen i spoke to at another

750
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,120
conference told me that he was a

751
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,360
professional trombone player prior to

752
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,039
coming into the field

753
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,720
i thought that was the most unique one

754
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,159
until somebody else told me he was a

755
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:45,919
hard rock geologist

756
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,360
and some of the most ridiculous

757
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,880
backgrounds

758
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,640
but they all share the same story of i

759
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,480
got a lot of rejection before somebody

760
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,159
took a chance on me

761
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:55,360
so

762
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,120
somebody coming from that background is

763
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,559
going to have perseverance because they

764
00:25:58,559 --> 00:25:59,840
wouldn't be here they wouldn't be at

765
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,159
this level still trying if they didn't

766
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,559
they're going to have discipline because

767
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,159
if you have no knowledge and you are

768
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:07,919
learning from scratch you have to have

769
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,240
that discipline to figure out what

770
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,000
you're doing

771
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,919
we all know that imposter syndrome is

772
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,600
rampant in our field

773
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,880
so

774
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,840
i think that goes maybe even tenfold for

775
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,279
people that don't have a background to

776
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,600
begin with in order to combat that you

777
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,039
you have to have the discipline to

778
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,120
continue studying to study on your

779
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,600
non-work hours um and to really try to

780
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,679
catch up when everybody else is pretty

781
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,080
far ahead of the curve

782
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,159
there's a level of self-investment i

783
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,240
touched on this a bit earlier i don't

784
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,240
think that always needs to be

785
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,400
financial but i think it often is

786
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,600
i think through some of the

787
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,840
certifications that i've had

788
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,919
that were not paid for

789
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,720
i saved them saved up for them so that i

790
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,240
could take the test and i could go

791
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,600
through the course

792
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,840
that was my self-investment the the time

793
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,320
i put into that the money that i put

794
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,880
into that i think you need a level of

795
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,720
self-investment in this

796
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,960
coming from this background to

797
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,240
really show that you're serious about it

798
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,720
as the rock says it's about drive

799
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,919
and

800
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:15,120
uh yeah i think drive is is huge that

801
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,960
may be one of the biggest factors here

802
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,039
is continually motivating yourself

803
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,440
regardless of external motivators

804
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,440
there are a lot of days that i'm not

805
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,520
motivated to do my job

806
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,799
there were a lot of days especially

807
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,640
coming into this that i wasn't motivated

808
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,840
but

809
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,640
i figured it out i did it in in

810
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,279
spite of not being motivated and when i

811
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,039
talk to other people that have done this

812
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,559
they they said the same

813
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,039
it's almost like a kinship that we have

814
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,200
and then of course the humility

815
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,120
as we said imposter syndrome is just

816
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,240
rampant

817
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:46,960
but

818
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,039
we also have a tendency i think in our

819
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,760
field to throw out acronyms expecting

820
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,080
everybody to know what we mean and throw

821
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,159
out tools or

822
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:57,840
different services and expect everyone

823
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,720
to know what we mean when the reality is

824
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,919
you know even

825
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,440
at this point in my career i still ask a

826
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,360
lot of the time what does that mean

827
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,000
i think that these individuals are going

828
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,480
to have to have humility

829
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,000
to understand that it's okay not to know

830
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,679
everything and it's okay to ask

831
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,679
questions

832
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,760
so the question comes to we talked a bit

833
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,399
about making sure earlier that people

834
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:27,840
are qualified

835
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,600
what should we be asking to make sure

836
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,360
that we're getting the right person

837
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,960
the last thing i would want to send you

838
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,440
away with is hey hire anybody off the

839
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,600
street anybody can do what we do that's

840
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,600
not what i'm trying to say

841
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,360
there are not everybody's going to be a

842
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,600
gem is the unfortunate

843
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,720
truth

844
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,360
so i think we need to ask diligently

845
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,640
some questions

846
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,480
and we need to be open to different

847
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,039
answers so for example asking them what

848
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,279
initially drew you to this field

849
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,120
why do you want to be here

850
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,760
you were a preschool teacher why do you

851
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,559
want to be on the sock and that's a

852
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,399
friend of mine

853
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:05,600
and

854
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,279
be open to the answers

855
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,440
try to understand their point of view

856
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,840
and what is is it just financially

857
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,080
motivating them is it

858
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,200
somebody else did it and they thought

859
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,120
it'd be easy so talk to them and

860
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,640
understand what do they

861
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,960
want to get out of this

862
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,360
ask them about their experience outside

863
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,559
of work

864
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:27,120
what i love to see is when people

865
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,120
have side projects whether it's um

866
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,960
a couple raspberry pi's that they've

867
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,840
connected they've built a pi cloud or

868
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,520
you know they have a home server they

869
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,880
bought and they've been setting up home

870
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,600
automation whatever it is ask them about

871
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,960
what have they been doing outside of

872
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,760
work

873
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,200
since their work is not related to the

874
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,320
field what are you doing to learn more

875
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,159
who are you meeting with are you going

876
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,559
to b sites are you going to meet ups

877
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,399
ask them about why

878
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,240
they're here um what are they doing and

879
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,679
then ask what's your evidence of

880
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,600
personal investment which

881
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,200
i wouldn't worry to like that to them

882
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,399
because they're gonna

883
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:04,640
they're probably gonna laugh at you but

884
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,640
ask them you know what have you done to

885
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,200
show that you should be here

886
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,000
if somebody asked me i would i would say

887
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
these are the ways that i've studied

888
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,120
these are the exact courses i've taken

889
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,000
these are the people i've talked to

890
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,360
and then i think some of the things that

891
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,279
we need to ask ourselves is what sets

892
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,720
them apart

893
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,880
for me uh coming from my counseling

894
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,080
background i build trust very easily and

895
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,600
i try to make my my clients now feel at

896
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,880
ease with me and know that they can

897
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,640
trust me and that even if we don't know

898
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,880
the answer right now collectively we

899
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,559
will figure this out because i have your

900
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,480
best interests at heart

901
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,200
i think somebody coming from a dis

902
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,279
non-traditional background is going to

903
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,279
have a couple

904
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,440
maybe claims to fame or

905
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,760
claims they say sets them apart so for

906
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,159
me it's uh it's trust for other people

907
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,000
it's attention to detail for others it's

908
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,200
communication

909
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,200
so while you're talking to them you know

910
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,399
you can post it to them but think

911
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,720
through to yourself what sets these pers

912
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,559
this person apart from the rest of the

913
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:07,840
candidates

914
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,440
how do they communicate

915
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,519
the unfortunate part is that you have to

916
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,360
communicate in this field

917
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,200
whether it's within the team outside of

918
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,240
your team you have to be able to

919
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,519
communicate

920
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,440
so

921
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,880
something to be aware of is how are they

922
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,399
communicating with you even in this

923
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,399
interview or this initial meeting that

924
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:25,919
you're having

925
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:27,600
and then again we talked about culture

926
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,960
before

927
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,880
how will they affect the culture are

928
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,679
they going to

929
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:36,399
improve it are they going to detract

930
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:39,440
from it or are they just going to fit in

931
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,600
if the answer is fit it that's fine i

932
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,440
think that's cool i would hope to see

933
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,519
that they improve it but

934
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,039
you know i would much rather somebody

935
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,640
that fits it than

936
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,480
somebody that detracts from it but uh

937
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,399
culture if you can find that person

938
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:53,840
that's going to improve your culture i

939
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,840
think that's going to set your team up

940
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,480
for success

941
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:00,720
uh one of the

942
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,240
questions then comes up is how do we

943
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,760
support and utilize these industry

944
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,440
transplants

945
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,200
uh one of the times that i shared this

946
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,799
somebody made the comment that it seems

947
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,240
like you just want to cater to the new

948
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,600
people and

949
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,440
you just want to throw new people into

950
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,559
any role

951
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:15,919
and that couldn't be further from the

952
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,600
truth

953
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,279
i think we just need to

954
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,039
position them well

955
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,559
i don't think we need to change

956
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,559
everything to accommodate them but we

957
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:27,200
need to find where do we have gaps and

958
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,640
then fill them

959
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,279
this uh the the phalanx i think is how

960
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,960
it's pronounced i had to google it

961
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,720
because i thought i messed it up the

962
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,679
phalanx formation from 300 where

963
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:40,720
each person held the shield to the over

964
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,240
themselves and the person to the left so

965
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,960
that they were covering any gaps

966
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,880
rather than trying to

967
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,279
fill specific gaps with just one person

968
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:51,360
let's get somebody that is holistic that

969
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,000
has a different view and see how they

970
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,440
can fill in some of the gaps we may not

971
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,240
even know that we had

972
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,840
that said i'm not going to say grab

973
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,960
somebody off the street and throw them

974
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,440
in a senior role just be willing to

975
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,799
maybe invest in somebody that doesn't

976
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,880
have the level of experience

977
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,760
that

978
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,600
that you would want

979
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,440
that you were always one

980
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,440
i know that there are examples and times

981
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,919
whenever you have to get a senior person

982
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,000
i wouldn't say this is for that scenario

983
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,240
but as you continue to hire and invest

984
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,159
in new people these are where this comes

985
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:23,279
in play

986
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:24,559
but i think we should be encouraging

987
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:25,360
them

988
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,120
letting them know that it's okay that

989
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,720
you don't know everything

990
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,480
we're going to figure it out together

991
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,279
play to their strengths if they

992
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:36,000
are a big time talker then let them talk

993
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,320
figure out who they can talk to and how

994
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,720
do you position them in the right place

995
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,480
if they are more of the note taker and

996
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,159
they take copious notes put them in a

997
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:45,360
role where

998
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,960
you need somebody that has attention to

999
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,159
detail

1000
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,720
let them explore a bit because as we saw

1001
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,640
in that other picture this field is so

1002
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,039
massive it may not be that they be on

1003
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,559
that they're on this

1004
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:59,360
portion of the company or the field for

1005
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,799
their entirety

1006
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:03,600
give them opportunity to grow

1007
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,880
and then of course be honest and

1008
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,279
constructive with feedback

1009
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,639
this is um

1010
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,239
this can be really hard for some people

1011
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,839
and others it's just second nature to

1012
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:14,159
say you're bad at this and let's figure

1013
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,599
it out

1014
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,520
it's not the case for everybody

1015
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,199
so be honest and constructive with your

1016
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,119
feedback give them opportunities to fix

1017
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,320
the things that you think they should be

1018
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,599
focusing on

1019
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,280
and help them

1020
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,639
realize that it's okay to ask these

1021
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,719
questions we talked about the humility

1022
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:32,960
before this is a perfect example of that

1023
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,320
i'd like to share a couple practical

1024
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,040
examples i got a new one from last night

1025
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,000
the

1026
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,159
gentleman uh jason over at black hills

1027
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,560
security if you get a chance um you can

1028
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,399
chat with him but he was

1029
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,320
i went to their meet up last night and

1030
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,760
it was nice it was really cool at east

1031
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,960
end brewing and he busted out uh black

1032
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,159
or what it's called back doors and

1033
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,040
breeches the ir game

1034
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,399
it's a cool game if you've never done it

1035
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:57,839
it's a great

1036
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,520
example of how to walk through an ir

1037
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,720
tabletop

1038
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,119
but i thought he was a real natural at

1039
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:04,800
it and when i talked to him today we

1040
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,400
were talking a bit about what i was

1041
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,640
going to be speaking about

1042
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,760
and he said yeah i used to be a comedian

1043
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,160
i was like well that's cool like what

1044
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,240
got you into this field and he started

1045
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,320
talking about his interests and i so i

1046
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,880
asked him what do you feel like has gone

1047
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,720
from your comedian days to your

1048
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,440
infosec days and he said the ability to

1049
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,960
maintain and hold an audience's

1050
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,359
attention and to jump into these ir

1051
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:32,880
table tops

1052
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,560
and i got to say i was floored was just

1053
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,040
how easy it was for him to just pop into

1054
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,040
different questions and not even knowing

1055
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,480
any of the people there

1056
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,200
he

1057
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,119
he just jumped in and asked great

1058
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,440
questions but it totally makes sense how

1059
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,119
somebody that was a comedian that was

1060
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:49,760
used to heckling and that's used to

1061
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,119
people uh

1062
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,920
trying to get a laugh engaging people's

1063
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,200
reactions

1064
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,720
prime candidate for running ir tabletops

1065
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,520
i have another friend that i met through

1066
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,200
a certification course that we had done

1067
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,160
together

1068
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,800
that was working at the prison the

1069
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,520
sheriff's office in his his county

1070
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,599
and he had no similar to me he had no

1071
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:15,680
background in computers anything i t

1072
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,800
related

1073
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,200
but he started working through he was a

1074
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,640
at the the deputy's office he became a

1075
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,720
um he was a guard and then he moved up

1076
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,280
to leading the guards and then he moved

1077
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,839
into a program management role

1078
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:33,359
and somebody said to him you really know

1079
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:36,079
your stuff about how to keep everybody

1080
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,560
how to your physical security controls

1081
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,680
and he's like i don't really know what a

1082
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,640
control is but i know how to keep people

1083
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,880
in and out of their building yeah

1084
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,839
and they said well you know in

1085
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:48,240
information security there's a big need

1086
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,760
for people that can

1087
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,640
tell us how to physically secure things

1088
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,680
and he's like well i don't know anything

1089
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,920
about cyber so

1090
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,440
he just started learning took the same

1091
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,079
route i did started asking questions

1092
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:02,960
going to meetups like b-sides or

1093
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,560
bar sides whatever whatever he has out

1094
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,440
there

1095
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,000
and so he's now a consultant leading the

1096
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,280
practice for a firm of physical security

1097
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,520
that's a such a stellar example and we

1098
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,359
want to go take this this certification

1099
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,920
course together both of us completely

1100
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,520
sure we were going to fail because we

1101
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:23,040
had a couple very technical guys with us

1102
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,640
and we were the only two that passed

1103
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,960
because we we came in with a fresh

1104
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,359
perspective

1105
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:31,760
so i think i always look back to him

1106
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,119
something that's totally seemingly

1107
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:34,720
unrelated

1108
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,480
it really benefited our industry as a

1109
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,359
whole

1110
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:38,800
so what i hope you get from all of this

1111
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,240
today is that

1112
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,000
we need people

1113
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
that are well-rounded we need people

1114
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,079
with a variety of skill sets

1115
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,240
we cannot continue to throw

1116
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,400
the same tactics at the same problems

1117
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,480
and accept expect something different to

1118
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,599
happen

1119
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:55,280
we need to continue

1120
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,440
working with people that may not have

1121
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,119
exactly what we've traditionally looked

1122
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,119
for but they're going to improve us

1123
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:03,599
they're going to improve us as a

1124
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,160
as a field entirely as an organization

1125
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,680
they're going to add to

1126
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,680
the the value that your security team

1127
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,000
brings

1128
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,880
yeah i think that

1129
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,119
we just need to continue being open to

1130
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:18,560
the people that may not look like what

1131
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,480
we've traditionally seen

1132
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,560
so just to wrap things up we already

1133
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,920
established there's a need for

1134
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,359
well-rounded information security

1135
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:27,200
professionals

1136
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,720
candidates i don't know how many more

1137
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,720
times i can say this these candidates

1138
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,560
have great tool sets that we can

1139
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,760
leverage

1140
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,040
and just be intentional about finding

1141
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,560
the right candidate

1142
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,560
not everybody's going to be a gem not

1143
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,240
everybody's going to be exactly what you

1144
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,320
need so be intentional as you're talking

1145
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,160
to people as you're figuring out what it

1146
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,320
is you are looking for maybe just have a

1147
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,079
different perspective as you're talking

1148
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:51,440
to a new candidate

1149
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,599
do you guys have any questions for me

1150
00:38:57,839 --> 00:38:59,680
it doesn't look like it

1151
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,240
oh maybe

1152
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,560
i heard a bit of that i think you said

1153
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,880
what area of security is a good one for

1154
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,400
somebody without this background to

1155
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,960
enter into is that basically it

1156
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,800
so i had this conversation earlier

1157
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,960
actually i think a great one

1158
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,160
and

1159
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,000
this i'm sure you there will be people

1160
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,599
that disagree with me

1161
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,240
i think grc offers a lot of opportunity

1162
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,480
and forgiveness

1163
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,920
i'm not going to say let somebody go

1164
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,359
lead an assessment but show them how

1165
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,200
controls are implemented and what kind

1166
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,880
of evidence are we looking for whenever

1167
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,480
we're doing a

1168
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,240
nist assessment or a high trust

1169
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,599
assessment

1170
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:45,200
you can show a junior person this is

1171
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,040
what that looks like and as you're going

1172
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,880
through it explain to them

1173
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,880
this is what this system means this is

1174
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,320
what this system does

1175
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,160
i think another one is identity and

1176
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,760
access management if you have a team

1177
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,920
that's dedicated to that you can bring

1178
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,560
them in where

1179
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,079
and i'm of course partial to that

1180
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:04,400
because that's how i started but seeing

1181
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,119
how

1182
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:07,359
access is provisioned and having people

1183
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:09,760
alongside me that showed this is why we

1184
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,839
do it this way

1185
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:13,599
there's a lot you don't need to have

1186
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:15,200
prior knowledge of a system you can

1187
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,800
learn that as you're going along so i

1188
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,760
think iam is a great one parts of grc

1189
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,240
can be a great one i'm not going to say

1190
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,400
go throw somebody straight into your

1191
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,079
your threat intelligence

1192
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:27,520
or threat hunting side but those are

1193
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:31,280
some good areas where you can start

1194
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,520
cool if nobody else has any questions

1195
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,680
that's me that's my email that's my

1196
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,440
twitter and if you want to chat in

1197

1198
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:45,760

1199
