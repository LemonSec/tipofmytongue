i am going to be talking about going

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,199
dark with consumer electronics um a

10
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,519
little bit about me first uh i'm a

11
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,800
father a husband a yinzer uh by day i

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,238
build socks and by night um i have panic

13
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,559
attacks and read privacy policies and

14
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,960
freak out about them

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,360
that being said um because this is the

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,960
first time i actually can include my

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,440
employer uh i have to say something

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,480
uh

19
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,160
all opinions expressed are my own and do

20
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,520
not represent the opinions of my

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,039
employer

22
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,480
so let's talk about going dark with

23
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,239
consumer electronics we'll hop into it

24
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:53,039
right

25
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,079
um

26
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,000
well it's simple

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,600
don't use it

28
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,399
great questions

29
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,000
we got like

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,559
35 minutes but no seriously we're gonna

31
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,159
talk about a couple things today

32
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,760
um first things first we're gonna talk

33
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,840
about the privacy problem

34
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,360
we're gonna then go on to talk about

35
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,000
some tools that you can use today you

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,759
can walk out of here and use these tools

37
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,320
today um to sort of start taking some of

38
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,840
that privacy back

39
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,680
uh we're gonna talk about uh some pro

40
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,840
gamer moves after that right everyone

41
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,600
loves that uh and then walk you through

42
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,080
a practical example uh and hopefully we

43
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,680
should have some time for some q a

44
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,200
that's usually my favorite portion of

45
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,720
this talk

46
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,200
that being said like phillyd says let's

47
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,040
just jump into it

48
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,960
so here's the deal

49
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,000
um we work in and live in interesting

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,880
times where everything has a wi-fi chip

51
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,520
um and it makes some things super cool i

52
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,320
can play angry birds on my refrigerator

53
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,159
i've always wanted to do that when i was

54
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,119
a little boy i said to my mom one day

55
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,520
i will be able to throw a red bird at

56
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,719
pigs on a refrigerator and she said we

57
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,360
should pay more for therapy um

58
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,439
right but all these offer really cool

59
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,160
conveniences uh to modern day life right

60
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,560
i love being able to yell at my alexa

61
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,640
and tell it to turn the thermostat down

62
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,720
when my wife sets it to an unreasonable

63
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,040
74 degrees in the middle of summer

64
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,800
right um here's the problem all of these

65
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,040
interesting fun things

66
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,440
require an account right that's tied to

67
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,560
you

68
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,400
um and all of these things uh

69
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,319
contain a lot of information about who

70
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,680
you are as a person right your habits um

71
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,080
your likes your dislikes uh you know it

72
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,120
was um not too long ago that the only

73
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,959
time you were recorded while eating

74
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,280
dinner was when you were in the federal

75
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,280
prison system um

76
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,080
now

77
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,599
you we just are willingly putting

78
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,760
microphones and cameras in our kitchens

79
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,720
right

80
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,400
so

81
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,599
what's happening with all this

82
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,120
information

83
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,680
what are they doing um i they wouldn't

84
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,280
let me bring the tinfoil hat into the

85
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,800
casino i can't imagine why um

86
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,000
so

87
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,440
let's talk about a couple things first

88
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,480
things first we have you right

89
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,599
then

90
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,959
we have the things that you use to

91
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,800
interact with the world right your

92
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,040
computer your phone your debit your

93
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,080
credit card and then we have your life

94
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,400
essentially the things you buy the

95
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,480
things you drive the things you take

96
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,840
pictures of

97
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,840
your medical the friends you have on

98
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,760
social media

99
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,720
and

100
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,360
all of that is inextricably tied

101
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,760
together right with those accounts that

102
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,280
we were talking about we were just

103
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,040
talking about right you have a bank

104
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,440
account that has a sign and you can then

105
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,440
see that you know your purchase the bank

106
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,280
can see your purchases all that's

107
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,959
information that's very valuable to

108
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,159
companies um a lot of times

109
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,319
they say that they're listening to you

110
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,080
and they're really not it's just they're

111
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,840
able to collect a bunch of ancillary

112
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,680
information from all the devices that

113
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,599
you use including these devices in your

114
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,439
home right

115
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,879
and they're able to do that we're gonna

116
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,799
i'm sorry for anyone who's a database

117
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,400
engineer i hate databases but we're

118
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,920
gonna talk about primary keys for a

119
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,840
second right and some of the simple ones

120
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,599
that we can sort of control

121
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,120
right so

122
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,280
our phone number our email address our

123
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,160
name

124
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,959
our address our ip address in the imei

125
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,560
of our phone right those are all things

126
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,759
we have fairly decent control over

127
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:24,880
so

128
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,680
now what do we do when we say going dark

129
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,520
what can we do with this information

130
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,400
well

131
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,360
we have this rat's nest of uh

132
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,440
of connections right what we want to

133
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,520
start doing is essentially building

134
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,280
firewalls

135
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,400
between

136
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,720
all of these uh

137
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,759
lifestyle choices essentially right um

138
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,600
what would you do you know what could be

139
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,040
learned about you if you only use uh one

140
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,280
credit card and one phone number and one

141
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,320
ip address for your auto insurance right

142
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,040
um what could be learned if you only use

143
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,600
one name a separate name a separate

144
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,840
credit card a separate phone a separate

145
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,400
computer for your social media accounts

146
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,120
right it becomes a lot harder

147
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,240
to make a profile of you as opposed to

148
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,639
this mess right

149
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,400
so we'll talk about some essentials that

150
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,720
you can use to sort of start undoing

151
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,199
this rat's nest and firewalling off your

152
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,520
life first things first is your phone

153
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,360
now

154
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,840
um i'm treading into

155
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,240
uh scary territory here we're gonna

156
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,840
start with the apple

157
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,479
uh android debate okay and i'm sorry to

158
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,800
anyone who's a green bubble boy um

159
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,039
you're not gonna like this um i want to

160
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,720
make something clear though

161
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,840
uh secure does not necessarily equal

162
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,880
private both platforms for the most part

163
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,479
are just as secure as one another um

164
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,639
where the uh privacy aspect comes in i

165
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,120
think that uh we can all safely say that

166
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,520
an ad company owning a phone operating

167
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,520
system is less private than a hardware

168
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,639
company

169
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,960
owning a phone syste a phone ecosystem

170
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,479
right so

171
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:09,840
here's the thing you're gonna want to

172
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,759
pick yourself up an iphone now when i

173
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,560
used to give this talk

174
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,240
we're just glossing right over that when

175
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,319
i used to give this talk i used to be

176
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,400
able to say um

177
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,400
you know uh

178
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,960
iphones were cheap right

179
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,759
uh it used to be um that you know it

180
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,080
wasn't a thousand dollars to get uh you

181
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,000
know the latest and greatest you could

182
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,880
the buried entry was like 200 bucks well

183
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,160
i don't know if you've noticed in the

184
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,600
past couple of years some interesting

185
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,960
things have happened right um so now i

186
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,520
really can't say that uh the barrier to

187
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,360
entry is about 400 bucks for one of

188
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,599
these very very sweet iphone ses

189
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,680
with a fairly decent amount of storage

190
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,800
right

191
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,639
i do have some honorable mentions one of

192
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,400
them is graphene os

193
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,199
um graphene os is a fork of what

194
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,160
formerly was known as copperhead os um

195
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,880
copperhead os there's a whole they call

196
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,240
it drama i don't know if it's

197
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,919
necessarily drama

198
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,080
their business model is interesting uh

199
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,240
graphene os is open source

200
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,560
um it's made it's android made private

201
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,680
by design so if you own a google device

202
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,080
you can flash this to it

203
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,599
um

204
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,599
the problem is that when you strip out

205
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,520
all the fun google stuff it kind of

206
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,520
makes it functionally unusable so

207
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,039
um that's privacy for you anyway

208
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,440
so we got our phone next up cell service

209
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,759
right um we've all heard of sim swapping

210
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,759
attacks the idea here is that we're

211
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,039
going to get a new phone number but

212
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,400
we're not necessarily going to use that

213
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,879
phone number right so we need a new sim

214
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:45,840
card

215
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,479
i recommend i sound like a drug dealer i

216
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,240
recommend prepaid cards um

217
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,639
specifically uh no i mention a lot of

218
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,639
services in this talk i'm not affiliated

219
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,800
with any of them just to be clear

220
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,800
i recommend mint mostly because you can

221
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,759
go to best buy and pay for them in cash

222
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,000
and you get t-mobile service which is

223
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
meh but it's better than like

224
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,840
us mobility or whatever mvmo they have

225
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,639
at your local walgreens right um it's

226
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,080
about 70 bucks for the year um

227
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,120
and you get uh a phone and or you get a

228
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,879
phone number and a decent amount of data

229
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,280
and they don't require you to give real

230
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,840
real names you don't have to provide

231
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,720
your real name which is fantastic right

232
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,360
the other option and this is

233
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,839
this is the ed snowden option in my

234
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,200
opinion

235
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,559
there's a group called the calyx

236
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,479
institute they will offer you a free

237
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,760
wi-fi hotspot with a i say free with a

238
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,160
600 donation annually um

239
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,440
listen we're laughing about money we're

240
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,399
going to talk about that at the end

241
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,720
don't worry um but you can leverage that

242
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,200
wi-fi hotspot with an ipod touch which

243
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,440
they recently discontinued much to my

244
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,720
chagrin but you can still pick them up

245
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,519
on the on the second market

246
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,880
so now we have our device right

247
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,560
we now need to actually use it for

248
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,200
something okay so the first things first

249
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,959
what does every service require when you

250
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,120
sign up for it besides a name not

251
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,040
necessarily yours

252
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,519
that's right email thank you for whoever

253
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,440
shouted that out

254
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,120
um we need private email so uh when

255
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,560
we're looking for

256
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,399
private email what we're looking for is

257
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,560
a brand new account from a privacy

258
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,800
focused provider um you're going to want

259
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,839
to do the due diligence of you know long

260
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,519
password 2fa um we're not using this

261
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,200
email account by the way so don't make

262
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,080
it like

263
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,920
cheerleadergirl69 at protonmail.com

264
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,920
right we don't want any identifiable

265
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,200
information although there are some

266
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,720
people in this crowd that might that

267
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,519
might not be identifiable um

268
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,720
uh

269
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,920
you're not going to use that email

270
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,200
address anywhere though we're not

271
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,880
signing up for anything with it it's

272
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,880
purely there

273
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,800
for our next for the next part of this

274
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,320
uh toolkit

275
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,800
when i talk about um private email i

276
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,360
really only am recommending these four

277
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,880
uh right now protonmail mailbox are you

278
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,600
uh tunta nota

279
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,519
which i'm sure is how that's pronounced

280
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,519
uh and start now these are providers

281
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,079
that have had their privacy protections

282
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,320
tested in a court of law

283
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,079
it used to be that i had this big long

284
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,399
list that i used to tell people and

285
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,560
point to and say hey these are people

286
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,200
you should check out

287
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,519
that is not the case anymore a lot of

288
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,120
these providers have had have had um

289
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,040
some sort of court order where they've

290
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,880
been forced to hand over information and

291
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,680
they've actually handed it over

292
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,519
so that's private email what do we need

293
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,760
next well we need to actually be able to

294
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,760
use our email and that's where our next

295
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,120
tool anon addie comes in so a non-addi

296
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,519
is essentially a service that allows you

297
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,680
to create on-the-fly email addresses

298
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,839
that will forward to your private mail

299
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,640
address so now we've eliminated the need

300
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,920
to give out our email address uh

301
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,399
to every single service now gmail offers

302
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,920
something similar to this right where

303
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,000
you used to be able to put like

304
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,399
spam plus your cheerleader69 gmail.com

305
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,600
right and have that filter um this is

306
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,560
similar but you don't need to

307
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,600
as long as the end domain is the same

308
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,320
and you can use custom domains

309
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,160
you can use the ones provided by a

310
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,560
non-addi um

311
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,640
you can use unique emails per service

312
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,640
right and that allows you to

313
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,800
again decouple some of that information

314
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,040
there's another honorable mention here

315
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,120
and that's 33 mail it essentially

316
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,600
provides the same service of uh a

317
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,440
non-addy however

318
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,200
uh the reason i like it on adding more

319
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,480
is just because it's open source um and

320
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,079
you can actually go and look at the code

321
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,440
although people say that i don't know

322
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,440
how many people actually do um neither

323
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,920
here nor there next

324
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,760
great we have a phone number we're now

325
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,920
able to sign up for stuff we have to pay

326
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,600
for stuff though right that's sort of

327
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,920
like the linchpin all of this is being

328
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,639
able to pay for stuff so uh when we talk

329
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:13,760
about paying for stuff we're gonna talk

330
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,160
about privacy.com for a sec so

331
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,639
essentially privacy.com it allows you to

332
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,320
connect to your bank and make purchases

333
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,880
with burner cards apple has a service

334
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,240
similar to this

335
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,839
where

336
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,600
you know the merchant doesn't see your

337
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,360
card number when you use apple pay but

338
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,200
you still have to use

339
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,279
apple and your bank still gets to see

340
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,760
the information of that transaction

341
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,079
with privacy the bank doesn't know what

342
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,680
you bought

343
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,160
it shows up as privacy.com

344
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,600
and the vendor doesn't know what card

345
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,519
you're using because

346
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,760
you're using a new card every time it's

347
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,720
really great when you want to make

348
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,920
purchases and you don't want your wife

349
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,600
to know what you bought and it's just a

350
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,279
dollar amount and you can just hand wave

351
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,839
that away right

352
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,279
so now the bank doesn't have that

353
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,959
information the vendors don't have that

354
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,440
information and more importantly you get

355
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,920
the product that you ordered

356
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,920
so the one thing we haven't talked about

357
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,240
we have our phone we have our email we

358
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,079
have our phone number that we're not

359
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,760
giving out to anyone what are we doing

360
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,680
about phone numbers well there's a tool

361
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,360
called mysudo

362
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,760
and what mysudo does is it allows you to

363
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,440
create um on the fly phone numbers

364
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,160
that will actually be registered with

365
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,320
services right so you can actually go

366
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,040
and type this phone number in amazon

367
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,040
for your 2fa or for your delivery

368
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,440
notifications and it'll work just fine

369
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,920
it will function essentially as a

370
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,839
voipline right

371
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,040
so you're not handing out the phone

372
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,480
number that's associated with your sim

373
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,560
card so companies aren't seeing your

374
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,959
imei they're just seeing your my pseudo

375
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,160
phone number right um again another way

376
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,240
that we can decouple that that spider

377
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,160
nest that we saw this morning or the

378
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,399
spider web that we saw earlier right and

379
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:01,600
this is going to essentially replace

380
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,800
your primary phone number you'll have a

381
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,240
phone number for amazon a phone number

382
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,040
for google a phone number for um the

383
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,880
etsy shop you're buying stickers off of

384
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,320
a phone number for

385
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,519
um

386
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,360
your daughter's school what have you

387
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,199
right

388
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,800
well what does that do with your old

389
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,320
phone number because i'm assuming your

390
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,040
old phone number is connected to

391
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,279
everything right

392
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,000
um and this is the one time i usually

393
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,240
say no to google sorry besides usually

394
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,880
say no to google um but this is the one

395
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,560
time i can recommend

396
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,199
google voice and here's why

397
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:36,480
chances are

398
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,880
you all have a gmail account

399
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,720
or have had a gmail account at some

400
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,279
point right

401
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,600
this gmail account you all you already

402
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,000
have a history with what i recommend is

403
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
porting your number to google voice and

404
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,639
then locking down that gmail account um

405
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:53,839
you don't want to let that number go

406
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,519
back into the public pool of numbers

407
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,480
because what could potentially happen is

408
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,360
your

409
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,920
pharmacy your doctor what have you has

410
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,320
that old number on file they're not

411
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,639
great about updating stuff fun fact

412
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,800
betty at the front desk

413
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,040
is not computer literate so

414
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,880
hitting that update button

415
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,639
isn't her number one priority it's

416
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,600
making sure that you pay so um

417
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,800
you know when you change your phone

418
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,480
number it can get uh you can get a

419
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,920
little hairy and you can wind up with

420
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,000
someone that you don't know getting your

421
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,519
information that way

422
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,519
so like i said if you port it over to

423
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,519
google voice i believe it's free still

424
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,680
as of

425
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,440
8 o'clock this morning so unless they

426
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,320
pushed out a change

427
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,880
that that's what i recommend for your

428
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,560
for your old phone number so we have our

429
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,800
toolkit right we have our email we have

430
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,320
our new phone

431
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,440
we have

432
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,759
um our phone number and we have a way to

433
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,759
make purchases

434
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,600
let's talk some pro gamer moves then

435
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,240
okay this is the one that everyone loves

436
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,360
let's talk about your isp well

437
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,839
you can now sign up

438
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:02,720
this is the only good thing about

439
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,199
coveted you can now sign up for your isp

440
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,360
without ever having to provide

441
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,000
real information outside of your address

442
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,040
so

443
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,320
john doe

444
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,519
can order

445
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,040
your email

446
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,720
or your isp

447
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,360
and you can pay for it with privacy so

448
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,600
now your name is not associated with

449
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,399
your internet service just your address

450
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,399
um

451
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,480
now let's talk about the ip

452
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,320
um itself that you get from your

453
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,920
internet service provider

454
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,320
you're going to want to use a vpn

455
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,600
and you're not going to want to just use

456
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,079
any vpn uh the ones i recommend again

457
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,519
these are because they've been tested in

458
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,800
court molved vpn and proton vpn

459
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,800
are the most reliable here's the only

460
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,040
thing uh the only downside if you're

461
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,720
paying for gigabit and you're using one

462
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,800
of these services to tunnel your traffic

463
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,399
you ain't getting gigabit

464
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,399
not happening um

465
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,720
so hey listen that's just cost savings

466
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,000
you don't have to pay for gigabit pay

467
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,959
for that

468
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,120
400 down and put it towards the iphone

469
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,319
that you have to buy now

470
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,679
that being said if you are going to buy

471
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,720
a vpn pay for it just pay for it if

472
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,400
you're not paying for something you are

473
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,799
the product so anyone that offers a free

474
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,599
vpn service is not doing you a favor

475
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,679
um pay for it pay for it pay for it

476
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,760
preferably one of these two

477
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,799
links in bio i'm kidding um

478
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,000
now let's talk about how we're going to

479
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,520
take care of our home network obviously

480
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,959
we need to connect to the internet

481
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,120
somehow um

482
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,960
how do we do that well obviously we need

483
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,559
a router of some kind and the one that

484
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,039
you get from verizon or comcast is

485
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,039
probably phoning home you have a couple

486
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,120
options actually um since we don't have

487
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,440
to worry about that sweet sweet gigabit

488
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,400
um

489
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,840
uh there's a company called protectly

490
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,400
that produces open source uh

491
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,240
they're actually just computers but

492
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,840
they're basically computers with a bunch

493
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,840
of extra nics which is all a router

494
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,880
really is

495
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,160
um

496
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,720
uh they produce uh but the um firmware

497
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,960
is all open source uh you could just buy

498
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,320
an intel nook um you could go on ebay go

499
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,320
on ebay and there are tons of companies

500
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,160
getting rid of five-year-old hardware

501
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,559
that is more than capable for your home

502
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,640
network your home lab what have you

503
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,919
um

504
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,520
basically if you can find a computer

505
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,600
that has four gigs of ram you're ready

506
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,160
to rock and roll by usb adapter you're

507
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,600
set

508
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,440
now what software are we gonna run

509
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,160
there's really only two that i can i can

510
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,000
safely say um

511
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,760
love this slide when it's blank where

512
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,320
did it go

513
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,679
hey gang i don't know what did i hit

514
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,679
something

515
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,330
it's back hell yeah okay moving on

516
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,919
[Laughter]

517
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,600
let's talk routing software so there's

518
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,520
really there's two options in my opinion

519
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,120
open sense and pf sense they're

520
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,880
essentially forks are the same thing

521
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,720
pick one it's a routing software if you

522
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,240
know how a firewall works you'll know

523
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,520
how to configure one of these

524
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,400
now

525
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,520
we're gonna get into the tricky bit

526
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,880
again

527
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,030
because we're gonna talk apple versus pc

528
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,640
[Music]

529
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,240
and you probably won't kill me for this

530
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,080
one so

531
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,039
when you're looking at uh a new computer

532
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,559
right that you want to use to maintain

533
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,480
your privacy um

534
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,520
apple is always an option i really think

535
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,760
their privacy is is top tier on their

536
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,320
devices so you could go with a macbook

537
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,720
or you could go with arguably arguably

538
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,559
the greatest laptop ever produced that's

539
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:31,679
right the thinkpad x220 from 2007.

540
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,000
i love this thing you can pick them up

541
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,960
for 50. you can open source all of the

542
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,039
hardware and you can install whatever

543
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,480
you want including mac os

544
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,919
we ain't going to be doing that though

545
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,440
right so let's talk about os for a

546
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,640
minute first off we all know windows 10

547
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,480
including windows 11 their privacy

548
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,480
nightmares even if you disable the

549
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,559
telemetry they're still sending a bunch

550
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,880
of stuff back to microsoft we don't like

551
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,320
that

552
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,240
and with windows 11 now you can't even

553
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,039
create a local account on startup of a

554
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,720
new computer you have to have a

555
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,960
microsoft account so

556
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,640
not not for me bro the other thing is

557
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,679
as much as i fawn for apple sometimes

558
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,120
they just have dumb dumb dumb bugs

559
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,120
really um

560
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,280
and they tend to not tell you about them

561
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,960
until they're fixed and that's usually

562
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,799
too late so

563
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,159
what does that leave us with everyone

564
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,240
that's right say with me linux

565
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,080
everyone's favorite

566
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,640
so you have a couple options if you just

567
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,799
want your computer to work

568
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,280
just download debian and call it a day

569
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,720
um it's open source they really are very

570
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,440
stringent about that um

571
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,520
and it will work on pretty much anything

572
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,120
uh i'm pretty sure i at one point i

573
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,960
installed debian on a

574
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,880
graphing calculator

575
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,840
um

576
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,520
if you want to be super paranoid there's

577
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,440
a ser or there's a operating system

578
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,200
called cube's os

579
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,919
which essentially allows you to do

580
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,400
with your computer what we just did with

581
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,600
our entire life right you have a virtual

582
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,200
machine that's just for work you have a

583
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,120
virtual machine that's just for banking

584
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,080
for shopping um for your personal work

585
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,080
right you can separate those out all

586
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,400
within cube's os

587
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,039
um that though comes with its own set of

588
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,640
headaches although if you're really

589
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,559
committed to this

590
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:23,360
it's

591
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,799
there's no other real way to go

592
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,960
and then we gotta talk about services

593
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,320
because with all this hardware comes

594
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,320
services right

595
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,799
it's an echo is not worth its weight in

596
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,799
gold if i can't yell at it and tell it

597
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,720
tell me when to leave for my next

598
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,640
appointment more specifically to be at

599
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,520
b-sides to give a talk at 10 a.m

600
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,360
so we have all these services right

601
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,200
google dropbox netflix right um

602
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,360
what do we do about these services

603
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,559
well

604
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,240
we self-host them

605
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,039
there are alternatives to all of this

606
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,720
um

607
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,400
and i think this is the crowd that would

608
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,559
be most adept at

609
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,080
actually pulling this off you can

610
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,400
basically self-host your entire life to

611
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,480
the point where instead of

612
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,400
you know using someone else's computer

613
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,240
it's your computer and you can point to

614
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,240
the disk and say that's where the photo

615
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,960
of my dog is um

616
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,320
and and that's

617
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,600
that's really where you can start to

618
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,760
take some of even more of your privacy

619
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,200
back right

620
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,520
i do want to shout out home lab os nick

621
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,480
busey

622
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,600
um he makes self-hosting uh a lot of

623
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,960
this stuff really really really easy um

624
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,120
you fill in a couple forms uh fill in a

625
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,039
couple yaml files and you're off to the

626
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,960
races um i actually i tested it um

627
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,799
and this is uh

628
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,960
aegis if anything i apologize but even

629
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,480
my mom could do it

630
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,480
so

631
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,080
great we have a bunch of tools i've

632
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,360
talked about a bunch of tools i've

633
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,280
talked about a bunch of crap what are we

634
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,640
actually going to do with it like how

635
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,520
does this work in practice

636
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,320
so

637
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,799
as i said before we have this rat's nest

638
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,280
right we want to get to here well how do

639
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,720
we do that

640
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,919
well

641
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,200
let's say

642
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,240
hypothetically you win uh an amazon echo

643
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,720
from one of the vendors outside um

644
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,240
right

645
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,679
well you're gonna need to sign up an

646
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,600
account with one of your brand new

647
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,159
computers that you just bought right

648
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,919
and you're gonna connect to that amazon

649
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:24,320
service with one of your vpns that you

650
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,000
just purchased and you're going to sign

651
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,360
up for an account

652
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,799
that you're going to use with that

653
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,600
amazon echo

654
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,120
cool um

655
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,480
we'll just chug along

656
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,840
what you're going to use for your user

657
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,360
or for your email address is going to be

658
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,600
a randomly generated and on addi address

659
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,240
right and you can see here

660
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,240
we just click sign in

661
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,640
punch in some fake information

662
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,600
and on

663
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,400
will forward that email and verification

664
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,039
to protonmail

665
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:58,799
and we'll be able to verify our email

666
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,960
great now we have an account look at

667
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,000
that

668
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,120
john doe

669
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,679
we have our anony email

670
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,440
and we have our password right

671
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,200
well now we need a phone number that's

672
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,880
tied to it

673
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,840
so that's where we go to sudo

674
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,760
we come in here we can pick from a phone

675
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,400
a list of phone numbers

676
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,080
call it second

677
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,440
because we are

678
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,799
if anything but creative

679
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,480
and from there we're able to tie it to

680
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,480
our account use it for 2fa use it for

681
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,720
notifications

682
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,520
and we have our uh ammo amazon or echo

683
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,159
plus uh hooked up right well now i want

684
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,520
to be able to yell at it and tell it i

685
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,880
need toilet paper because there's a

686
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,400
storm coming right

687
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,960
that's where privacy.com comes in

688
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,960
we create a new privacy card by the way

689
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,120
this is live if anyone writes this down

690
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,360
and can use it before anyone else great

691
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,959
you get ten bucks on me enjoy

692
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,880
um

693
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,120
but as you can see

694
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,400
we are able

695
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,799
three two five four look at that three

696
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,200
two five four elliot anderson we're able

697
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,720
to add that to our account under a

698
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,279
completely different name too

699
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,440
and that's how we set up our echo plus

700
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,039
and now

701
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,200
we have a nice mustachioed man look at

702
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,799
him he's gorgeous

703
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,919
able to use our echo plus

704
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,600
and that's it you're private that's the

705
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,279
end of it nothing else there's no

706
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,760
problems with this no flaws at all

707
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,200
right

708
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,200
there are some cons

709
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,080
so first things first not all services

710
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,360
are going to like your voip phone number

711
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,480
from my sudo it gets uh it'll often get

712
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,880
flagged as a prepaid number

713
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,520
so that can be difficult

714
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,200
the other thing

715
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,640
the way privacy.com works today

716
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,320
when you create those cards they're

717
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,840
created as

718
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,279
gift cards

719
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,440
and some merchants don't like that

720
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,480
i can assure you amazon does

721
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,400
the other thing is added complexity and

722
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,279
this is probably the biggest con

723
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,520
um

724
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,799
when you set your life up like this

725
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:05,679
um

726
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,559
you become the single point of failure

727
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,440
if uh something were to happen to me uh

728
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,039
my wife is screwed

729
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,480
okay um

730
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,440
the added complexity is certainly uh

731
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,200
something that you have to account for

732
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,360
right you're not using as much compute

733
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,520
space but now you are up here there's

734
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,200
more to remember there's more to um

735
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,279
sort of process at any given moment i've

736
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,559
gotten really good at responding to

737
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,640
names that aren't my own uh because of

738
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,520
it

739
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,919
um and finally doesn't account for

740
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,760
anyone else and this is the one that i

741
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,880
experienced most recently um

742
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,039
my kids were uh

743
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,600
we're gonna go to uh summer camp my mom

744
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,520
signed them up just gave my information

745
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,520
out no problem here

746
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,520
tell here's his full name his address

747
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,559
his phone number all this other crap

748
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,480
i i you can't account for what other

749
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,720
people do right so if the other people

750
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,240
in your life are not bought into the

751
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,400
same program

752
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,799
this ain't gonna work right

753
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,080
and finally

754
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,960
we have three real things to consider uh

755
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,520
conspicuousness money and what i call

756
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,720
privacy fatigue so here's the problem

757
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,279
when you i'm going to use this image as

758
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:24,000
much as humanly possible when you

759
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,279
try to

760
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,240
um

761
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,399
decouple your life right and maintain

762
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,720
more privacy the problem is you also

763
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,520
become rapidly more noticeable

764
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,840
um who's this guy with eight people

765
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,520
living at his address

766
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,240
right with different names um who's this

767
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,000
uh you know who's this guy that um

768
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,919
every time he checks out he uses 30

769
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,120
different credit cards right there is a

770
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,399
uh

771
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,640
there's a level of conspicuousness it's

772
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,880
um oh god i've been watching a lot of

773
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,480
order and a lot of law order in

774
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,840
quarantine so i apologize but there's an

775
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,399
episode of law order where the guy is

776
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:03,919
trying to avoid cameras by using this

777
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,159
face paint right the problem is the dude

778
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,399
is now walking around outside in face

779
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:09,440
paint

780
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,919
right so it's not that the cameras did

781
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:13,520
the cameras didn't pick them up at all

782
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,720
right but

783
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,720
everyone noticed the weird guy in face

784
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,919
paint on the on the uh on the six right

785
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,360
so

786
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,200
the part of this is you do become a

787
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,600
little bit more noticeable

788
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,840
um the other problem that we touched on

789
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,360
is money right um i don't know if you

790
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,880
started doing some of the tallies in

791
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,799
your head just to get started on a lot

792
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,480
of the stuff that i talked about it's

793
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,279
about a grand let's be honest between

794
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,440
your internet service provider getting

795
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,440
the new phone getting your sim card set

796
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,520
up signing up for all these services

797
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,799
it's about a grand

798
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:47,919
um

799
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,520
and that means that to a certain extent

800
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,080
this privacy is behind a paywall right

801
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,000
you basically have to rip and replace

802
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,360
your life and we all know how well that

803
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,559
goes in business right um

804
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,279
i would argue that that's not um

805
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,279
how life should be everyone has a right

806
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,760
to privacy right um i don't think that

807
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,640
that's a debatable fact um the problem

808
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,600
is that that right is kept behind

809
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,480
you know

810
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,960
a thousand dollars and and know how

811
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,720
the other problem here is privacy

812
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,520
fatigue it's exhausting living like this

813
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,440
it is not sustainable

814
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,399
um

815
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:27,600
and you're going to mess up it's the old

816
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,000
security adage right the attacker has to

817
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,559
be right once you have to be perfect all

818
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,240
of the time and that's very much the

819
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,600
case with this

820
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,360
so

821
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,200
yeah you can go through and do a lot of

822
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,559
this stuff to take some of your privacy

823
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,960
back and i encourage it i absolutely do

824
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,960
this is not a fatalist view

825
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,840
um

826
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,840
everyone has a right to privacy everyone

827
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,120
should be trying to maintain their

828
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,399
privacy um i know the uh

829
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,320
the usual response to that is oh well i

830
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,159
don't have anything to hide and it's not

831
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,880
about having anything to hide um

832
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,540
it's about um

833
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,840
[Music]

834
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,200
let's put it this way

835
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,520
we all know what you do when you go to

836
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,600
the bathroom but i would argue that it

837
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,679
takes a very

838
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,399
specific type of person to want to do

839
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,640
that in a public venue

840
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,520
um

841
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,600
privacy is not about having something to

842
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,840
hide privacy is about choosing

843
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,399
the uh when where and how

844
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,399
uh you disclose information about

845
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,559
yourself and loved ones right so what

846
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,960
can we yeah we can do this ourselves

847
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,720
right but let's be honest my mom's not

848
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,799
flashing an android phone you know i'm

849
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:35,279
not gonna convince my brother uh

850
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,919
you know to uh i'm not gonna convince my

851
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,159
brother to install cubes right he's got

852
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,240
excel documents to work on

853
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,559
he's a productive member of society

854
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,559
unlike the degenerate that stands before

855
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:47,360
you

856
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,960
um

857
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,320
well there are a couple groups that are

858
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,799
actually fighting for our rights um and

859
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:56,960
while i don't recommend um

860
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,960
i always recommend direct action right

861
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,080
you don't need to give these people your

862
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,080
money what i would recommend is you give

863
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,000
these people your time and attention

864
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,760
there are a couple one is mark or the

865
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,000
march against revenge porn

866
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,880
um

867
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,360
they are a group obviously fighting for

868
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,320
uh

869
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,760
the rights of people who have suffered

870
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,399
from non-consensual image abuse um

871
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,720
ironically enough privacy is part of

872
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,600
that

873
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,240
um the other option is uh operation safe

874
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,080
escape they help victims of domestic

875
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,799
violence get out of those situations

876
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,640
they again are also very concerned about

877
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,840
the privacy of their um

878
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,640
of their clientele right so uh it

879
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,240
behooves them to fight for stronger

880
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,960
privacy policies and finally last but

881
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,519
certainly not least the eff you know

882
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,760
them you love them i don't need to say

883
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,679
any more on that

884
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:47,440
and gang

885
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,880
that is my talk i think we have

886
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,720
six minutes for questions

887
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,480
so um

888
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,840
what i will ask uh it tends to be

889
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,799
um

890
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,679
male dominated so uh if i could have

891
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,919
alternating um

892
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,640
uh people who identify as female or

893
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,679
non-binary with men who are identified

894
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:12,080
as male or non-binary asking questions

895
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,600
back and forth that would be preferable

896
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,919
so any um

897
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,600
women who identify as female or

898
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,200
non-binary

899
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,679
questions

900
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,360
dope dudes let's go what do we got

901
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,600
right there

902
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,480
the only reason i don't recommend open

903
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,559
wrt is because it's a little bit more

904
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,960
limited in its functionality so

905
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,200
when you're looking at um

906
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,240
solutions openwrt gives you

907
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,720
somewhat the uh what you need to run

908
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,480
essentially a home network whereas

909
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,720
opensense and pf sense they have

910
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,200
plugins and and more that will run on

911
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,960
beefier hardware and you get more of an

912
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,799
enterprise experience so you can do

913
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:00,159
stuff like dpi with open sense and pf

914
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:01,600
sense whereas

915
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,080
with open wrt it will

916
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,240
chug

917
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,960
does that answer your question

918
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:12,960
or non-binary

919
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,760
cool next dude what do we got

920
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,919
right here

921
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,600
question yes we should be concerned um

922
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,360
and that's why uh

923
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,000
again what we're fighting for is

924
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,240
um you know better privacy protections

925
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,960
overall that being said um the reason

926
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,519
these services were chosen is because

927
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,600
they have a track record for maintaining

928
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,519
their users privacy um whereas google

929
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,519
has made it pretty clear facebook has

930
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,120
made it pretty clear your data is up for

931
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,439
sale

932
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,240
anyone else

933
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,679
yes

934
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,080
great question they don't have it in the

935
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,360
first place

936
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,960
that's the key here um

937
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,760
great

938
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,480
wonderful how does a service provider

939
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,879
uh prevent from is how is a service

940
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,320
provider prevented from coughing up

941
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,599
information in the first place in a

942
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,359
court of law

943
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:20,800
and the answer to that is they don't

944
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,399
have it in the first place

945
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:24,159
um

946
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,440
for uh

947
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,159
protonmail all they have is your email

948
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,320
address and your password um and not

949
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,839
even your password they have the salt of

950
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,960
your password and it's store whatever i

951
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,560
i'm not great at encryption i'll be

952
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,359
perfectly blunt that's math and i failed

953
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,918
for or i failed sophomore algebra okay

954
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:44,159
so don't ask me about math i trust the

955
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,520
nerds on that one

956
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,399
um

957
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:48,239
but essentially the idea is that these

958
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,079
companies will collect the least amount

959
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,879
of uh data possible to provide you your

960
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:55,280
service so protonmail they have your

961
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,040
email address they don't necessarily

962
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,800
need a name you can pay for it in

963
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,839
bitcoin or monero or whatever um malvad

964
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:03,040
they don't even have that much

965
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,880
information they have your user id that

966
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,560
is randomly generated when you click

967
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,400
sign up and that's it

968
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,359
um

969
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:12,400
so the idea here great question the idea

970
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,160
here is that these companies collect the

971
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,160
least amount of information possible so

972
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,920
there's nothing that a court can compel

973
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,000
them to give to them because there's

974
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,720
nothing to be had

975
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,119
any other questions

976
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,280
right here

977
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,760
tips for combing through privacy

978
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,560
policies great uh i did mention at the

979
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,040
start that i do have panic panic attacks

980
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,560
reading privacy policies um i i don't

981
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,240
have a great answer for that um

982
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,079
unfortunately uh i forget where i read

983
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:51,760
it but um

984
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,359
it uh it's

985
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,040
there's a statistic floating out there

986
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,400
and someone will probably find me and

987
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,400
correct me on twitter after this that

988
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,599
um

989
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,640
it would take you 800 years to read

990
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,640
every single privacy policy that we

991
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,920
agree to

992
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,720
in our daily lives right not

993
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,839
that's not doable for

994
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:13,359
anyone um there are a couple services i

995
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:14,800
know that are out there that will help

996
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,359
you sort of process these policies but

997
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:19,520
those policies change at any like can

998
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,440
change at any time and it requires

999
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,839
someone to read them to fully understand

1000
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:26,400
what is in there

1001
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,040
so the data tends to be a little bit

1002
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,280
behind

1003
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,640
right what their what their current

1004
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,680
privacy policy may

1005
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:41,520
be do i think of tor

1006
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,280
here's uh this goes back to the

1007
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,680
conspicuous part uh that i mentioned at

1008
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,359
the beginning the problem the only

1009
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:50,000
problem i have with tor is that people

1010
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,119
will know you're using tor right um

1011
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:54,960
or uh

1012
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,920
your

1013
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,000
internet experience will be

1014
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,800
functionally unusable right if anyone

1015
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,760
here has tried to use tor over a vpn

1016
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,720
um

1017
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,040
look i lived through to the 90s i don't

1018
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,079
want to go back okay

1019
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,119
um

1020
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:13,599
so that's the only from a usability and

1021
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:15,280
conspicuousness perspective that's the

1022
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,680
only reason i don't i don't leverage tor

1023
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,079
although that being said cube's os which

1024
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:22,160
is made by a bunch of really great folks

1025
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,040
all those updates run over tor so you

1026
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,240
know what the hell do i know

1027
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,479
right here

1028
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,000
essentially yes it is a how to create a

1029
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,640
sock puppet

1030
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,240
different use cases tails is sort of

1031
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,160
like i need to

1032
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,280
i should have prefaced this at the

1033
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,079
beginning um this applies to corporate

1034
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:54,000
surveillance right if you're a nation if

1035
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
you're targeted by a nation-state actor

1036
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,400
don't ask me for help don't talk to me i

1037
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,400
don't need that heat

1038
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,680
right

1039
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,879
i don't want to deal with that

1040
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,280
but essentially yes

1041
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,839
it is how to create a sock puppet these

1042
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,839
tools much like many in the infosec

1043
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:13,599
industry can be used for good they can

1044
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,599
also be used for bad

1045
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,440
but i would argue that

1046
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,520
the masses having this information at

1047
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,880
hand is better than is worth worth the

1048
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,480
risk but yes it is essentially how to

1049
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,000
create a sock puppet

1050
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,320
100

1051
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:30,880
any other questions

1052
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,400
sorry i didn't say that in the mic any

1053
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,160
other questions

1054
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,599
up

1055
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:38,760
right there

1056
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,000
uh oh god i don't want to

1057
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,480
weigh it into these waters so um the

1058
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,920
question was uh my recommendation for mb

1059
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,920
why didn't i recommend plex here's the

1060
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,920
deal i have a black server let's be

1061
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,359
honest how many people here have a plex

1062
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:02,880
server at home

1063
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,560
right do you know why you have a plex

1064
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,119
server at home because it freaking works

1065
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,560
i love mb i love mb and i cannot stand

1066
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,119
some of the stuff that um plex is doing

1067
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:14,720
right now because i'm worried that their

1068
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,640
business model is moving away from

1069
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,240
personal media server to personal

1070
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:22,000
streaming service right but it works i

1071
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,839
i'm giving this talk right everyone can

1072
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:25,839
see what computer i have i'm not giving

1073
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:27,839
this talk from a thinkpad that i rooted

1074
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:30,079
and did all that other stuff to you know

1075
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:32,640
why because my mac works that's the

1076
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,440
problem all of this stuff is a nightmare

1077
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,720
to deal with and it doesn't like it's

1078
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,640
not anything that anyone outside of our

1079
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,960
field can understand which is why we

1080
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,960
need to pick up the mantle and fight for

1081
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,640
these better protections

1082
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,599
i

1083
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:48,640
i

1084
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,200
am giving this presentation from a mac

1085
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,560
because

1086
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,040
i'm sorry libreoffice and open office

1087
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,000
absolutely terrible uh they're not

1088
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,400
i'm i'm gonna get so much flack for this

1089
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,800
terrible they're not great for daily use

1090
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,960
they're great if you want to support

1091
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,680
open source i like what they're doing um

1092
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,720
but from a like presentation perspective

1093
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:14,240
or like daily use it i'm again there's a

1094
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,000
very select group of people that can

1095
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,640
pull that off and i am not one of them

1096
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:21,280
um i'm not farting around with fonts at

1097
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,400
two in the morning when i'm trying to

1098
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,400
get a presentation done okay i'm sorry

1099
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,839
does that answer your question i'm sorry

1100
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:31,440
that i went off on a rant there

1101
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,560
no it's because so mb is more focused on

1102
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,960
providing a personal media server

1103
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,599
and plex is slowly becoming more focused

1104
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:42,880
on

1105
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,640
being like everyone else and gathering

1106
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,480
your data right they want to be a

1107
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,040
personal streaming service right they

1108
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,119
want you to hook all your accounts up to

1109
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,040
them so you can find

1110
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,720
where bluey is playing uh you know

1111
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,839
in your streaming library um

1112
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:00,720
and that's

1113
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,160
the other thing is i don't like that

1114
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,839
they require

1115
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:06,480
their authentication servers to be on in

1116
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,440
order for you to authenticate to your

1117
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,359
personal server

1118
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:12,560
um

1119
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,040
that was a that was another complaint um

1120
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,520
it's my data is here i can see it i can

1121
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,280
look at the files but i can't play it

1122
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,960
because your authentication servers are

1123
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,760
down

1124
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,640
um

1125
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,040
so that's why i recommend mb over over

1126
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,720
plex i think the long-term viability is

1127
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,079
much better

1128
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:32,640
from a personal media server perspective

1129
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,760
that answer cool

1130
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,119
i don't know how much time i have for

1131
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,640
more questions i don't know if someone's

1132
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,400
flagging me down

1133
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,440
what's up

1134
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,119
five minutes okay we could probably do

1135
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:45,040
two more anyone else

1136
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:48,200
right here

1137
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,960
you guys love throwing questions that

1138
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,599
are going to cause problems

1139
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:57,119
yes yes i do um and it's it's meeting

1140
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,280
people where they're at right for all

1141
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,200
the flaws that signal and the

1142
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,280
organization might have

1143
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,400
um

1144
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,359
yeah you know it's better than

1145
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:08,960
i mean it's better than imessage it's

1146
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,160
better than

1147
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,640
just plain text message uh and if i can

1148
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,200
convin if it's ease of use

1149
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,240
uh is to the point where i can convince

1150
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,480
you know my loved ones to use it

1151
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,400
great fine i'll put up with the gifts

1152
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,560
but whatever you know what i mean

1153
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,359
um and i mean that's

1154
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:29,040
that is a

1155
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,119
that is absolutely a situation where

1156
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:33,440
it's meet people where they are at right

1157
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,720
um

1158
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,920
what's the other one that i'm thinking

1159
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,319
of that everyone's on not whatsapp oh

1160
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:39,760
god

1161
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,400
thank you telegram yeah um some people

1162
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,440
use telegram some people use wire like

1163
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,640
right there are all these different

1164
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,640
encrypted email or encrypted messaging

1165
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,000
applications

1166
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,160
it's all about what's the easiest to use

1167
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,000
and what you can get people on because

1168
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,880
something is better than nothing

1169
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,800
one last question

1170
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,359
right there

1171
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,800
sorry can you

1172
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,040
years of drumming has left my hearing

1173
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,400
absolutely obliterated

1174
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:18,480
a good solution to a master password are

1175
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,280
you like a password manager

1176
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,560
so um you can actually

1177
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,720
you can actually

1178
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,040
um

1179
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:31,680
so there's two options here really in my

1180
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,560
opinion um outside of

1181
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,880
buying a service right um there's bit

1182
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,160
warden and there's uh keepass right so

1183
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,920
bitwarden is essentially uh it's akin to

1184
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,079
1password or

1185
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:49,440
lastpass or dashlane or whatever your

1186
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,040
favorite youtuber's hawkin um

1187
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,400
they um they provide a fairly seamless

1188
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,960
experience you can host it yourself um

1189
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,560
and you can use uh ub keys and set up

1190
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:06,000
2fa properly with it um that being said

1191
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,200
if you don't want to deal with all that

1192
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,960
hassle

1193
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,680
keepass is the next best solution that

1194
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,119
being said the only problem with keepass

1195
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:14,480
is you need to make sure that you can

1196
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,960
get that database somewhere

1197
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,119
and keep make sure that it's up to date

1198
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:21,440
so that you can use it i have many a

1199
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,119
time been burned by that

1200
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,839
um there's nothing like being stuck at

1201
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:28,079
an alamo rent-a-car unable to log into

1202
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:29,520
your email because you didn't sync the

1203
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,640
right password database over okay so

1204
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:36,200
potential downsides

1205
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:38,000
all right

1206
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,480

1207
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,200
being said i'll be here all day um find
