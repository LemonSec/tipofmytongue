1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,840
thank you so much um pleasure to be here

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,120
obviously this is threat modeling 101 uh

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,200
we'll be covering threat modeling attack

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,679
defend the security convenience spectrum

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:12,799
those are all

6
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:15,519
really really massive topics so this is

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,279
a high level talk

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,680
first and foremost i respect your time

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,119
if we start getting into this and you

10
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,279
say you want to go deeper feel free to

11
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,880
head out go check out some vendors

12
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,039
explore another talk remember your time

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,880
is valuable so make sure you're in the

14
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,800
right spot secondly we all just ate

15
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,520
lunch if you just need some nice soft

16
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,840
voice to help you fall asleep i will not

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,840
be offended close your eyes have a great

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,600
nap enjoy

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,000
the time away from work

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,120
so

21
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,600
all that being said ignore that no

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,960
sleeping in his talk

23
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,800
all that being said my name is steve

24
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,760
grant my pronouns are he and him um

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,239
for work i am a senior engineering

26
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,399
manager and product owner at fifth

27
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,600
season

28
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,199
i'll break each of those down starting

29
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,800
with fifth season so we're based here

30
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,119
out of pittsburgh we are a controlled

31
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,360
environment agriculture vertical indoor

32
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,240
farm

33
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,400
really a lot of cool buzzwords basically

34
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,479
we're just robot farmers we use

35
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,400
technology to do all of our decision

36
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,960
making and we produce a million pounds

37
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,280
of leafy greens right out of braddock

38
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,960
right next to a steel mill so go to

39
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,080
giant eagle check it out it's cool stuff

40
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,560
the other part i'm a senior manager and

41
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,320
a product owner normally we see that as

42
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,479
two different things right our product

43
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,960
owners say here's what we need to do go

44
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,400
figure it out and then our engineering

45
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,960
managers say okay great here's how we're

46
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,560
going to accomplish it well when i have

47
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,159
to wear both of those hats at the same

48
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,119
time it really makes me think of okay

49
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,960
what's important to the business how can

50
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,520
we as a team do this and do this right

51
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,040
without having the technical debt in the

52
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,799
future so a lot of what we're going to

53
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,720
be talking about today is kind of driven

54
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,880
from that perspective of

55
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,360
four leaders for product owners for

56
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,640
managers and people that are just

57
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,719
generally new to security how do we get

58
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,680
involved with some of these concepts

59
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,600
i don't have a lot of social but please

60
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,520
hit me up on linkedin i had some qr

61
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,520
codes here that aren't working but if

62
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,878
you want to copy this slide deck just

63
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,239
send me a message

64
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,000
as well as my manager readme i think

65
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,440
it'd be awesome if all managers came

66
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,360
with readme files and so there's a site

67
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,680
called manager readme where you can go

68
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,360
and check out

69
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,200
myself and encourage your managers and

70
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,879
other people in your leadership to write

71
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,040
their own readme files outside of that

72
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,840
i'm a big ci cd junkie grew up and cut

73
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,760
my teeth on the devops this admin side

74
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,000
of life but huge board game player if

75
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,360
anyone wants to play some magic later

76
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,640
hit me up

77
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,160
always looking for a good fish taco so

78
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,840
if you've got a good recipe send that my

79
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,680
way as well

80
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,480
so

81
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,000
breaking all that down our little dash

82
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
dash help as i said i'm not a cyber

83
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,400
security engineer i'm focusing on the

84
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,080
business helping the business get the

85
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,720
goals that they need to do better work

86
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,160
a lot of people here might be in that

87
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,680
same boat a lot of people aren't but at

88
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,040
the end of the day we're all just trying

89
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,280
to have good secure systems right

90
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,800
there's a hundred thousand different

91
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,360
ways that we can accomplish that goal so

92
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,879
with some of my backgrounds in systems

93
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,440
engineering and other tools

94
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,440
i'm focused now on bringing this to the

95
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,360
forefront like i've said convincing

96
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,879
other people in leadership that these

97
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,560
are the things we need to be pursuing

98
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,920
these are the roads that we need to go

99
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,920
down and the first and foremost step in

100
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,840
doing that is having these kinds of

101
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,519
threat models and some of the tools to

102
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,040
help understand our threat models are

103
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,040
going to be this miter attack and defend

104
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,799
framework

105
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,080
all right

106
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,000
introductions out of the way heads up

107
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,560
let's go why is security important

108
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,640
relevant xkcd right

109
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,720
every architecture every infrastructure

110
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,360
that we have is going to be composed of

111
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,040
thousands and thousands and thousands of

112
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,640
other little pieces

113
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,239
how many people here have written all

114
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,400
those pieces yourself

115
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,159
absolutely no one right

116
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,000
even if you go down and you write your

117
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,840
full application you're probably writing

118
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,920
it on someone else's operating system or

119
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,360
you're probably using hardware you did

120
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,439
not assemble unless you're printing your

121
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,599
own silicon chips like we're relying on

122
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,480
other people

123
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,200
in the community in the culture to help

124
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,599
with the security right so we need to

125
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,840
trust and understand that nothing that

126
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,360
we have

127
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,840
uh is fully in our control so we need to

128
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,319
be prepared for some of this and so then

129
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,639
we might be asking all right cool why is

130
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,399
that important

131
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,478
really simple this is my favorite uh

132
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:21,839
clip art that i found out on the

133
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,759
internet it's a happy guy holding money

134
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,919
right why is security important why do

135
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:26,960
we care

136
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,479
the technology industry is ridiculous 65

137
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,520
of global global gdp is technology

138
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,560
driven

139
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,240
people in our field people in the

140
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,400
technology space we are at the forefront

141
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,479
of the money that's going and driving

142
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,720
the world forward when technology and

143
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,639
security events happen

144
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,360
those things fall apart so of course

145
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,040
businesses are going to say yes we need

146
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,199
to invest in security we need to do

147
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,560
these things and it's our job to help

148
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,360
explain it to a lot of these people

149
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,680
so what is threat modeling right you

150
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,680
hear this i've heard this talk like or

151
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,120
mentioned a couple times already in just

152
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,759
various talks that we've had um

153
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,560
is it some crazy ridiculous thing

154
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,880
not really it can be really boils down

155
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,039
to three questions what are we talking

156
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,000
about

157
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
where can it go wrong and then what are

158
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
you going to do about it so it's it's

159
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,479
really simple when you think of it in a

160
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,320
nice easy sentence x poses a risk to y

161
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,199
so i'm going to do z we are all humans

162
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,960
we have evolved to just kind of

163
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,639
inherently have this notion and

164
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,080
understanding of things

165
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,080
you know i'm worried about falling down

166
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,919
the stairs so i'm going to hold the

167
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,720
handrail or maybe i shouldn't have

168
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,320
drinks with my neighbors the night

169
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,240
before i go speak at b-sides because

170
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,759
then i might do a poor job on my

171
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,280
performance

172
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,199
irrelevant i just say

173
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,320
so

174
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,600
let's think through this and with kind

175
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,919
of this easy mode notion right doors

176
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,919
just login services for our houses

177
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,600
that's all they are everyone knows doors

178
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,680
we've all used them so let's think of

179
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,000
this scope what is the door we want to

180
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,240
focus on that one item they allow this

181
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,400
ingress egress for this house they're

182
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,520
composed of glass wood aluminum what

183
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,680
other materials make them up

184
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,720
okay we know our scope we understand

185
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,240
what we're talking about we've kind of

186
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,600
reduced this down

187
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,360
what are some threats that we have here

188
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,080
right lock picks everyone's hopefully

189
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,600
checked out the lock picking village you

190
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,759
picked up a tool or trick or something

191
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,440
and now you can go and pick locks you

192
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,440
are now a threat to all the other house

193
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,199
login services in the world

194
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,520
congratulations

195
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,520
smart lock hackers right smart locks are

196
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,520
being pretty popular you connect them

197
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,080
with your home iot system and now

198
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,600
someone on the other side of the world

199
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,360
could invade your wi-fi and unlock your

200
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,680
door for you for someone else to come in

201
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,919
or you know what if this google picture

202
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,919
that i found is your house i would say a

203
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,479
large rock is a very strong threat to

204
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,639
your door and so it's thinking about all

205
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,319
these things right what are the the

206
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,759
things

207
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,479
if you have a child or anyone else you

208
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,039
yourself are a forgetful human failure

209
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,680
to use the service correctly is also a

210
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,880
big threat

211
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,919
um

212
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,160
so we have this notion of right

213
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,240
we know the things that can go wrong we

214
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,840
know what we're talking about what are

215
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,199
you going to do about it

216
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,120
so the final step in any kind of a

217
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,520
threat model is to mitigate the risks

218
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,360
motion alarms are great for a sliding

219
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,039
door like this

220
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,880
if you want to get really crazy you know

221
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,520
what hire guards with dogs and you know

222
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,440
set up a massive security system around

223
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,280
your house it's probably not practical

224
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,039
for most people but you know what if

225
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,479
this was my door i might just take an

226
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,319
old broom handle and shove it down in

227
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,960
the corner because that'll work 98 of

228
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,759
the time see exhibit a large rocks

229
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,199
um

230
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,280
so it's it's again just this notion and

231
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,800
we do this all the time as i said this

232
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,800
is very intrinsic to us of how threat

233
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,000
modeling approaches but when we start

234
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,360
thinking about

235
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,360
software and technology this is really

236
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,639
where we need to start being a little

237
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,120
bit more specific so this example is

238
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,879
taken straight from the owasp website

239
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,800
they do a great breakdown of the threat

240
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,800
modeling process they run through it

241
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,199
with this college library website right

242
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,520
really think basic example

243
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,599
staff students can log in librarians can

244
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,240
add books remove books add users etc

245
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,879
right like real simple basic kind of

246
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,319
application

247
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,800
so as we start thinking about this you

248
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,599
know

249
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,919
number one assessing our scope where do

250
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,919
we want to draw the lines right all

251
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,759
these systems and subsystems and

252
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,599
subsystems of those systems are

253
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,680
interconnected for the purpose of our

254
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,199
specific threat model that we're talking

255
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,599
about what do we care about

256
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,039
because you could go down the rabbit

257
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,120
hole and start getting into the bare

258
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,120
metal that's hosting your college

259
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,640
library website

260
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,039
so really understand who do you want to

261
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,200
trust and what do you want to control

262
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,519
and there has to be a level of trust of

263
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,519
your subsystems or of these other black

264
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,760
boxes that you're just blindly accepting

265
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,480
the output from them as your input

266
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,920
so figure out whether you're zooming in

267
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,839
or zooming out and whether you want to

268
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,760
just say you know what we trust our

269
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,760
systems engineers we've done our

270
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,360
research on our vendors and our third

271
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,200
party we understand that they're going

272
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,480
to do a good job protecting their

273
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,320
systems let's just focus on the stuff

274
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,640
that we are writing in-house or you

275
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,399
could say you know what we're doing a

276
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,680
deep dive into every tool we're only

277
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,200
using open source software that we

278
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,399
understand and going down that road

279
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,880
so first steps going through assessing

280
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,760
scope

281
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,279
probably i would say the most important

282
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,240
part of figuring out what you're

283
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,480
actually talking about just draw it out

284
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,440
remember i'm a manager i left technology

285
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,000
and i lost any intelligence that i had i

286
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,839
need nice pictures anyone in your

287
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,519
leadership will appreciate a nice

288
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,720
picture

289
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,320
so we can look at these kind of things

290
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,240
and we can already see all right we've

291
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,399
got a lot of points of contact a lot of

292
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,320
data flow where we're storing a lot of

293
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,000
this information

294
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,040
what are some of these external

295
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,519
dependencies that we care about where

296
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,600
are we drawing those trust borders and

297
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,959
saying we will allow these things to

298
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,200
come in versus not

299
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,800
what are these exit points which are

300
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,240
just as important as entry points if a

301
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,920
hacker can get into your system but

302
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,279
can't really do anything with the

303
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,279
information you have some level of

304
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,560
coverage there

305
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,720
um and again just re-establishing the

306
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,760
the trust levels so looking at this

307
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,440
we're thinking about this library

308
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,360
example uh

309
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,600
where do we want to start our scope is

310
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,959
assessed let's think through those three

311
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,880
questions here's what we're talking

312
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,160
about

313
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,240
what can go wrong with it

314
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,640
that's where mitre attack really comes

315
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,959
into play so this is

316
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,120
massive i'm sorry anyone in the back

317
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,839
like you go to

318
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,600
attack.mitre.org this is what you see

319
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,560
this is a little overwhelming especially

320
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,760
if you're sitting in the back of the

321
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,839
room and it's all just blurry to you

322
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,959
so what are we actually looking at here

323
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,120
real simple it's a user base or

324
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,200
knowledge base of everything that can go

325
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,120
wrong right played a lot of street

326
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,160
fighter ii

327
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,760
i would always get my butt beat and i

328
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,519
would say all right i know that move i

329
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,279
recognize that that's that hadouken i'm

330
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,480
used to that thing hitting me in the

331
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,800
face i don't know how they do it

332
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,640
this is what mitre attack is right it

333
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,560
says here's all the things that can hit

334
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,480
you in the face and then here's how

335
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,519
they're done

336
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,800
so it's this massive massive library of

337
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,560
all these different things that we can

338
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,440
utilize to understand how someone might

339
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,600
try to impact our system

340
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,600
so if you drill into this there's 191

341
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,120
techniques and those techniques break

342
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,519
down further into 386 different sub

343
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,200
techniques

344
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,920
and so again that is a lot of

345
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,519
information right if you're starting

346
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,200
your security program if you're trying

347
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,200
to figure out which direction to take

348
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,519
your team what do you just throw a dart

349
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,519
at this board it's like no there's other

350
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,440
good information out there

351
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,600
we got to think who

352
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,720
or what is most likely going to impact

353
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,800
our system what is the best use case if

354
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,720
we've got a limited amount of time how

355
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,640
do we approach this

356
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,720
so thinking about this

357
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,040
some of our first places you know

358
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,880
database files comes up how do we secure

359
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,920
our database we've got the sql queries

360
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,720
reaching now we've got the different

361
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,480
user groups

362
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,399
and then those calls going through this

363
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,160
limited example obviously we would have

364
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,600
had this mapped out a lot deeper with

365
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,480
the technologies and tools available but

366
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,079
it's quite obvious when you start

367
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,519
thinking about it

368
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,639
it's us

369
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,360
we're the baddies we're the bad people

370
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,440
us being humans interacting with your

371
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,440
system i don't care how secure your

372
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,680
system is there's probably a username or

373
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,480
password that breaks it pretty quickly

374
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,079
i love this this comes from the verizon

375
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,320
data breach investigation report again

376
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,160
another fantastic read they publish that

377
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,120
every year definitely check it out 82

378
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,519
percent of breaches involve the human

379
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,079
element right look at this graph is it

380
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,959
easier to create a zero day and create

381
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,519
some exploitative vulnerability

382
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,000
or just steal someone's credentials like

383
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,240
these are really easy concepts so we say

384
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,279
okay

385
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,160
if we know our users are probably the

386
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,240
weak link in the system

387
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,399
let's keep that frame of mind and go

388
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,440
into this miter attack framework

389
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,360
so once you start diving into some of

390
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,399
this

391
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,720
you can really poke into things so you

392
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,639
dive into that big miter chart you

393
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,160
scroll down you find something that kind

394
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,760
of relates to what you're talking about

395
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,600
and we come here oh credentials from

396
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,720
password stores okay again dumb manager

397
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,279
hat let me read what some of this is uh

398
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,000
people steal your local password stores

399
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,920
okay i understand what that attack

400
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,560
vector looks like but with these and a

401
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,000
couple of the other ones let's dive into

402
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,680
some of these sub techniques to really

403
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,600
understand what's going on

404
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,120
credentials from web browsers we're all

405
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,200
using web browsers

406
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,680
what does this look like and again mitre

407
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,920
attack just really dives deep into a lot

408
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,279
of this

409
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,800
for those in the back that can't see

410
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,519
this if you're on a windows system using

411
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,440
google chrome here's how you get the

412
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,680
database file from that system here's

413
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,639
the sql you can use to extract that

414
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,880
information and here's the api function

415
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,440
to decrypt that and all this information

416
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,760
and all these attack patterns are right

417
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,639
there

418
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,880
at your fingertips if you're running

419
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,800
through that attack system

420
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,880
and what's really great about attack is

421
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,360
it breaks all these down into these four

422
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,680
main areas so one understanding what the

423
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,079
attack is and how it works again the

424
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,000
manager give me nice simple words let me

425
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,920
understand a lot of these things browser

426
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,079
store passwords so they must store them

427
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,279
somewhere right

428
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,000
thank you procedure examples

429
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,839
as we said we're getting used to hitting

430
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,120
the or we're used to getting hit in the

431
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,199
face with those sudukins who's doing

432
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,519
that well we've got silver terrier using

433
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,959
agent tesla and they try it roughly 17

434
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,440
000 times a month and they yield almost

435
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,800
a thousand successful exploits these are

436
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,800
references to different nsa papers

437
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,720
different government papers other things

438
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,279
that are coming out from analysts saying

439
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,519
hey here's an attack we saw here's how

440
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,000
they did it and then mitre attack is

441
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,920
taking all that information and building

442
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,839
it out into that framework so we're all

443
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,120
using the same language so when we start

444
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,600
thinking about mitigations attack leads

445
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,920
us down some good rabbit holes of things

446
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,160
that we can do to work with some of

447
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,000
these mitigations and remember that's

448
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,760
our third question in our threat model

449
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,560
of

450
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,480
you know what are we talking about how

451
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,240
is it going to get broken and what are

452
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,160
we going to do about it

453
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,240
and attack again presents that in a nice

454
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,360
way so you can say here's how i can

455
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,760
mitigate it here's how i can detect it

456
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,880
but let's go a step deeper

457
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,760
let's jump into mitre's defend so a lot

458
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,680
of people have probably heard of mitre

459
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,880
attack

460
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,880
miter defend went under the radar

461
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,680
because it came out

462
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,600
mid-2021 still in covid craziness we're

463
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,360
not going to conferences

464
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,040
might have you know just completely

465
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,920
missed your radar but

466
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,959
defend.miter.org they use the elite

467
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,079
three on defend just as a point of note

468
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,000
keep that in mind because we're hackers

469
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,480
right you got to

470
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,720
so might defend is really interesting

471
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,440
because these are just fully interactive

472
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,839
websites so if we go in and look at

473
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,839
these artifacts that we have here in the

474
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,480
middle we can start well i guess let me

475
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,199
say to break this one down further this

476
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,680
is your rock paper scissors map right

477
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,560
if mitre attack is saying here's all the

478
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,480
bad things that can happen here's how

479
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,160
they do it

480
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,040
mitered defend is saying here's what

481
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,320
beats what

482
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,399
obviously both coming from mitre spoiler

483
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,600
alert there's going to be some

484
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,160
connections between the two

485
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,160
so that being said we can start using

486
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,160
for some of these artifacts right we're

487
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,240
concerned about our users and

488
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,399
specifically our user accounts so we can

489
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,440
just go to defend search user account

490
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,680
and boom great more information for

491
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,040
people that are trying to figure this

492
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,800
out for the first time making sure we're

493
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,040
all talking about the same thing and

494
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,360
then what's great about

495
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,440
defend is we're seeing where some of

496
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,360
these other pieces are that might relate

497
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,040
to this puzzle so if you're exploring

498
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,399
this road for the first time you can say

499
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,959
i'm interested in user accounts okay

500
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,720
what composes user accounts what goes

501
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,560
into it and then you get these wonderful

502
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,079
charts showing other things that

503
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,199
contribute to it diving further into

504
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,400
this and again this is all on the site

505
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,160
you start seeing related countermeasure

506
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,760
techniques and related offensive

507
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,280
techniques so all these red ones are

508
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,599
attack vectors so if we go back to miter

509
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,199
attack we could find each of these

510
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,959
listed in that massive massive chart

511
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,160
somewhere and how the action impacts the

512
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,679
artifact itself

513
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,760
similarly we have all these related

514
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,720
counter measures that we can use to

515
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,640
prevent some of these things and so

516
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,440
maybe

517
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,080
we have a strong password policy that

518
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,320
strengthens our user account or maybe

519
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,480
biometrics for authentication or

520
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,400
multi-factor authentication right

521
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,559
multi-factor is huge we should all be

522
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,200
doing that so if we dive into

523
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,960
multi-factor hey great defend again says

524
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,200
here's all the different attack vectors

525
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,880
that multi-factor authentication is

526
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,480
going to help you out with

527
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,400
so as we're building these models we can

528
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,400
start to determine where do we get the

529
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,480
best bang for our buck which of these

530
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,559
tools is going to help us out

531
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:05,760
and so just going looking at

532
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,640
multi-factor we've got this list of

533
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,120
different ways that we can stop whatever

534
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,720
that attack vector is that we're

535
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,120
interested in

536
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,160
so

537
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,160
the fun thing is you can make this into

538
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,760
any kind of training activity if you

539
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,080
want right what attack vector is hidden

540
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,760
here and start working on this with some

541
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,280
of your team you know what things could

542
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,919
access your keyboard input device but

543
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,799
could be isolated or detected using i o

544
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,440
port restriction

545
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,559
key logging

546
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,480
and then some of these maps are pretty

547
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,080
complicated when you start mapping out

548
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,760
the ways all these different things can

549
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,200
interact together

550
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,600
so you know what are something that's

551
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,120
accessing credentials and trying to

552
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,760
access command history logs right

553
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,160
hey look our bash history this is a real

554
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,000
thing hackers get into your system and

555
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,640
they can just go and see your bass bash

556
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,120
history files and some of these defend

557
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,960
techniques are ways that we can prevent

558
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,440
that and slow things down

559
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,480
so

560
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,200
great we are all happy we now have this

561
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,400
wonderful threat model we understand

562
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,880
what we're talking about how things can

563
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,799
occur and what we can do about them

564
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,160
right

565
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,080
bring this back to work and you're now

566
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,200
famous

567
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,720
not quite yet

568
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,360
because behind all of this behind every

569
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,080
one of these companies is this notion of

570
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,840
business value

571
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,440
and we all love cyber security right

572
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,880
that's why we're here we think security

573
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,559
is really important we think it's cool

574
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,080
we think it's where we should put all of

575
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,640
our money in but ask your boss what is

576
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,880
more important that your email server

577
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,480
stays up or that you have a strong cyber

578
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,840
security problem

579
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,360
more times out of not they'll probably

580
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,880
say we need email for business

581
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,559
functionality

582
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,559
and so when we start thinking about

583
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:49,840
these it's like

584
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,240
how do we do this how do we sell this

585
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,880
because it's always roi right everything

586
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,120
is about roi when it comes to businesses

587
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,960
remember 65 of global gdp there's a lot

588
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,039
of money on the table when we're talking

589
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,200
about cyber security

590
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,960
and some of this is really really hard

591
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,880
to present and say this is why it's

592
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,400
important

593
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,159
and some of these security practices are

594
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,720
a real pain and some of them are

595
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,240
terrible for users some of them are

596
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,240
terrible for engineers some of them are

597
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,760
terrible for leadership who has to pay

598
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,159
for some of this and so organizations

599
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,400
will treat our cyber security like any

600
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,320
other kind of operational expense

601
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,400
prioritize it based off of that return

602
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,480
on investment so one of the things in

603
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,400
our jobs as we're building out these

604
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,480
threat models using the miter tools and

605
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,880
technology is to understand what that

606
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,120
roi impact is

607
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,760
really understand this notion of the

608
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,559
secure side versus the convenience side

609
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:45,600
i don't know how many of you were in the

610
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,159
privacy talk earlier but there's a lot

611
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,320
of really cool things that we can do to

612
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,200
be super super secure guess what it's a

613
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,480
real pain in the ass and it works sure

614
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,159
but again you've got a lot of hoops you

615
00:20:58,159 --> 00:20:59,440
gotta jump through in order to make that

616
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,400
happen

617
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,760
and someone has to use that convenience

618
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,000
and so it really depends on where you

619
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,159
want to break that cost down

620
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,679
who's going to pay that cost and what

621
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,200
does that actually look like

622
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,480
is it just you know requiring

623
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,159
re-authentication and multi-factor every

624
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,559
single call your application makes well

625
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,000
then your users are going to eat that

626
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,840
cost and they're likely going to hate it

627
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,760
and want nothing to do with it is it

628
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,200
just a really cool out of the box

629
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,960
application that you want to buy great

630
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,559
your leadership has to pour their money

631
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,080
into it this is something we're going to

632
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,280
write in-house something we're going to

633
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,520
maintain build and work on awesome

634
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,360
that's engineering time that's going

635
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,880
into all these things

636
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,360
and so like any good scrum agile

637
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,520
practitioner we get to point things we

638
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,280
can size things however you want to call

639
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,679
it if we look at these different efforts

640
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,280
and these different actions that we can

641
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,159
take

642
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,559
we can explore these different levels of

643
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,960
effort whether it's a complexity thing

644
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,280
whether it's an exertion thing

645
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,440
a risk to your current systems or

646
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,520
different resources that it is and each

647
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,039
of these will map somewhere to a

648
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,200
different cost that someone has to pay

649
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,640
that could be your opex that could be

650
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,679
your capex your customer support cost or

651
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,919
even just your customer experience right

652
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,159
if your system sucks to use you're going

653
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:13,760
to lose customers that's going to lose

654
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,520
business and leadership's not going to

655
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,000
be happy

656
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,400
and so we look at you know thinking back

657
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,320
to our library example let's think you

658
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,760
know we have our users we know

659
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,200
multi-factor authentication is a good

660
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,200
way to do this how do we approach this

661
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,679
our library is on google suite you know

662
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,480
90 of the world is on google suite or

663
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,320
office 365.

664
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,880
for google suite hey i want to enforce

665
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,960
two-step verification

666
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,280
that's it it's a check box it's included

667
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,120
out of the box right if you're using

668
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,480
google suites and you don't have

669
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,640
multi-factor authentication enabled

670
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,000
you're doing something wrong because

671
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,640
it's literally one button click

672
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,320
sure you might have some experience with

673
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,400
your users that have to re-authenticate

674
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,400
the first time or if they lose their

675
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,000
cookies or change their device having to

676
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
re-authenticate with multi-factor and

677
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,360
that's where some of that cost comes

678
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,640
into play

679
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,400
and then you go through these exercises

680
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,240
and you can write these little blurbs

681
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,720
and say for this threat model we think

682
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,400
users are a big thing that we need to

683
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,760
worry about here's all the attack

684
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,919
vectors that can happen with compromised

685
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,679
credentials

686
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,000
here's a solution that we think will

687
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,799
work it's low complexity low exertion

688
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,960
mild risk in case you have a service

689
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,960
that's using this that would need to get

690
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,640
re-authenticated

691
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,000
but our resource implementation is

692
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,679
really minimal so when you think of that

693
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,159
on that spectrum it's a high level of

694
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,320
security with a fairly low cost and

695
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,360
therefore

696
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,840
a high convenience factor as well so

697
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,159
multi-factor again i can't say this

698
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,039
enough users are bad multi-factor is

699
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:45,039
good

700
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,000
so

701
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,559
the the final part here is is the

702
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,360
security worth it right you know we have

703
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,080
to think sanely about security what is

704
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,760
within your realm of control what are

705
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,919
you willing to risk right

706
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,400
are you worried about ninjas beating you

707
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,919
up in the street

708
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,240
probably not if a ninja approached me in

709
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,960
the street i'm done but i'm not you know

710
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,880
that's not an active part of my mental

711
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,960
threat model in everyday life

712
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,880
snakes are a common fear for a lot of

713
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,200
people snakes on a plane maybe even for

714
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,559
some but

715
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,200
how many people are afraid of cars right

716
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,679
what is more likely to injure you a

717
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,240
snake or a car so think about these

718
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,240
kinds of things you know where your

719
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,400
fears are set where your threat model is

720
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,200
based and then avoid going down these

721
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,279
dark alleys if i know there's ninjas and

722
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,279
snakes down this alley i'm not going to

723
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,840
go there should i allow my users to

724
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,080
click links that get sent to them should

725
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,679
i allow them to install their own

726
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:42,960
software

727
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,200
choose in your model what level of trust

728
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,200
you want to have what capabilities you

729
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,360
give to your users

730
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,679
and the the final part here is you know

731
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,960
think more broadly right i'm not so

732
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,840
focused on one specific type of snake

733
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,240
that i'm going to miss everything else

734
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,400
reptiles in general let me just focus on

735
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,400
what do i do if i get poisoned right

736
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,720
seems like a fair response have these

737
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,880
broader scenarios these broader

738
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,720
playbooks incorporated in your threat

739
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,799
model so that way you can understand and

740
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:16,159
you're not lost down the weeds too much

741
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:17,039
and

742
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,559
all this is great right we come to this

743
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,400
conference we learn all this this is all

744
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,720
just wonderful theory none of it means

745
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,320
anything in cyber security unless we

746
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,720
actually do something with it

747
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,080
each of these areas that i've talked

748
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,159
about could use their own deep dive you

749
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,000
know portions every slide here could

750
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,240
probably be its own talk as you go down

751
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,320
these rabbit holes especially with miter

752
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,720
attack and defend

753
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,640
so i'm going pretty quick so i want to

754
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,320
take some time after this and kind of

755
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,159
poke around attack and defend show you

756
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,480
what that looks like and i strongly

757
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,400
encourage you to do the same these are

758
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,279
open source projects they are free tools

759
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:52,400
to use

760
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,440
save them

761
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,960
show them to your leadership show them

762
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,039
to your team and then we can all start

763
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,799
speaking the same language

764
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,799
and then additionally as you're thinking

765
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,320
about this and it's one of those things

766
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,919
once you see it you can't unsee it

767
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:05,279
you'll start thinking about personal

768
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,520
threat models in your personal life and

769
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,520
your personal security and then that's

770
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,960
where you start building those memories

771
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,000
and bring those to your corporate

772
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,440
security

773
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,440
atomic habits aggregation of marginal

774
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,880
gains again

775
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,720
what are your small things you can do

776
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,720
that can have big impacts preda

777
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,919
principle focus on the vital few make

778
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:26,159
those changes iterate make those changes

779
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,400
iterate do what works and by the end

780
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,159
you've got all these different security

781
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,600
measures encompassing broad spectrums of

782
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,760
different ways to prevent you from being

783
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,080
infiltrated defense in depth is a goal

784
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,919
but you have to start somewhere that

785
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,200
somewhere of course is users

786
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,400
and remember you're not alone on this

787
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,400
journey right we're all here at b-sides

788
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,840
we're all friends

789
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,080
so next year i want to see someone up

790
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,600
here diving into one of these techniques

791
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,600
come give a talk at b-sides it's not

792
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,760
scary i promise you

793
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,840
but get involved get to meetups

794
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,919
understand what the

795
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,520
industry is doing subscribe to

796
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,440
newsletters follow different youtube

797
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,440
channels see what's going on there so

798
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,760
that way you can stay fluent with it

799
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,679
because we're all in this together i

800
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,840
would say 65 percent of the world is in

801
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,840
this together as we navigate these cyber

802
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,679
security roads there's a lot of good

803
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,440
information out there

804
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,440
final tldr

805
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,159
threat modeling really simple x poses a

806
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,640
risk to y so i'm going to do z at the

807
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,640
highest level it's your choice on how

808
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,399
deep you want to get into that play

809
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,159
around with attack and defend and then

810
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:31,760
prioritize your biggest bang for your

811
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,360
buck you've heard me harboring

812
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,520
credential hardening but then you dive

813
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,919
into these matrixes and got plenty of

814
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,279
time to do that here so let's go ahead

815
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:40,000
and

816
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,080
jump over to that

817
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,080
so if i go to the

818
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,679
mitre defense site

819
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:48,960
this is it

820
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,000
as i said defend.miter.org

821
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
all these nodes are active these are

822
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,399
different areas that we can jump in so

823
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,399
you've heard me harping on credential

824
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,240
hardening let's just click credential

825
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,360
hardening

826
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,960
these are those things that we were just

827
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,480
talking about all the different sub

828
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,880
techniques by activating credential

829
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,480
hardening these are all the different

830
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,559
artifacts that we're going to be able to

831
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,480
start securing

832
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,159
so you can dive down into each of those

833
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,720
ones and hey look here's all the related

834
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,640
attack techniques that we now have

835
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,080
coverage for

836
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,840
so if we want to jump around and poke

837
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,840
around with some of these we definitely

838
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,120
can do that

839
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,720
if we look at credential accessing

840
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,840
os credential dumping

841
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,000
we can

842
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,399
search these up

843
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:39,039
os credential dumping i will add this is

844
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,880
constantly under work from the team at

845
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,960
mitre so as they're rolling out new

846
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,880
features read their release notes maybe

847
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,080
that link was supposed to work and it

848
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,480
didn't i don't know but i could jump

849
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,159
over here to credential hardening and

850
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,840
that gives me a lot of these inferred

851
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,440
relationships that we were just talking

852
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,279
about look at all this stuff that comes

853
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,559
in what an os credential hardening or os

854
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,039
credential dumping attack can do the

855
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,799
different artifacts that that level of

856
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,320
effort can hit

857
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,200
so again strongly strongly encourage go

858
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,440
through these poke around there's a lot

859
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,720
to see here

860
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,640
multi-factor authentication these were

861
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,840
the screenshots that i was showing

862
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,600
earlier

863
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,039
the attack website attack.mitre.org

864
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,840
same thing we've got all this ridiculous

865
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,559
amount of information here so if we

866
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,240
wanted to dive into those credentials

867
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,799
from password stores here it is oh hey

868
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,559
look here's that agent tesla that we

869
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,880
were just talking about here's all the

870
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,679
references to different papers

871
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:39,520
here's the reference paper from fortinet

872
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,880
of that group out of nigeria and attack

873
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,360
matrices that they used so all that

874
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,360
information is linkable through that

875
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,200
attack framework you're able to dive

876
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,679
into it and explore it around so again

877
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,840
strongly strongly encourage that dive

878
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,080
deep into these these tools are

879
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,440
phenomenal

880
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,240
so

881
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,399
keep that one at a

882
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:01,840
tight 30 we don't need to go the whole

883
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,360
45 but thank you for the time hopefully

884
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,279
you learned something if anyone has

885
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:09,520
questions i will try my best to answer

886
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,760
them

887
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,320
thank you
