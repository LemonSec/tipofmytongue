awesome so uh my name is John

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
hollenberger I work for secureworks uh

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,920
we're a consulting company we also have

9
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,520
an xdr solution but I'm on the instant

10
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,439
Response Team there uh more importantly

11
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,300
the proactive incident response team so

12
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,880
my job entails essentially anything

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,740
before an incident occurs so I teach a

14
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,480
number of courses teach folks how to

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,140
collect and preserve evidence I teach

16
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,360
I I do

17
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,120
tabletop exercises on the regular

18
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,320
throughout the last year or so I've been

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,620
in about 50 of these so I've I've been

20
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,300
through a number of them and then I also

21
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,100
work on instant response plans uh just

22
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,300
show of hands how many people actually

23
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,920
have an instant response plan for their

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,719
organization

25
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,379
all right so not too bad almost everyone

26
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:58,440
all right so who is this guy uh so this

27
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,280
is me

28
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,320
um so I am a volunteer firefighter I've

29
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,940
been in the fire service for 20 years

30
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,580
now uh served as the company president

31
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,580
for 15 years I've been a fire officer on

32
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,619
and off throughout my career

33
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,240
um currently serving as a sergeant for

34
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,760
the fire department so I do a number of

35
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,460
fire trainings as well as facilitating

36
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,380
table tops

37
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,840
um other than that I'm married that's my

38
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,939
wife there we love to be outdoors on the

39
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:26,340
water uh hiking mountains doing all

40
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,380
kinds of fun things anything to get away

41
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,720
from our four crazy kids so we've got

42
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,759
four of those two boys two girls from

43
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,759
six to twelve pretty much keeping us

44
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,720
pretty active so when I'm not doing

45
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,220
instant response when I'm not fighting

46
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,079
fires I'm running around with the kids

47
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:46,200
I'm also a runner so I do a lot of

48
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,119
Charity charity work and charity running

49
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:51,119
so a few years back I actually ran the

50
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,040
Pittsburgh Half Marathon in my fire gear

51
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,740
so that's a picture of me running uh on

52
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,659
that I've been doing it security for 15

53
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,420
years a lot of my time has been spent

54
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,219
doing instant response doing

55
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:04,740
vulnerability assessments I dabbled in

56
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,719
PCI compliance for a bit that scared me

57
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,758
away from security I went and was an I.T

58
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:11,099
director for a few years because I

59
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:13,620
didn't want to do compliance anymore and

60
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,900
then I moved on to secureworks where I'm

61
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,260
at now

62
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,879
so tabletop exercises how many people

63
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,800
know what a tabletop exercise is and

64
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,260
actually does them in their organization

65
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,120
just about everyone how many have done

66
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,940
one in the last year

67
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,420
okay and how many in the last quarter

68
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,920
man okay

69
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,620
awesome thanks so

70
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,180
um we're going to talk about four things

71
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,400
today four key considerations when

72
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,379
talking about table tops and I'm going

73
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:45,540
to compare those to firefighting and how

74
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,319
they

75
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,260
um compared and contrast to firefighting

76
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,660
uh so before we really get into things I

77
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,739
want to talk about the types of

78
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,920
tabletops that we often do

79
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,940
cross-functional table tops are probably

80
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,260
the most

81
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,140
um most prevalent ones that I do with

82
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,480
with companies cross-functional really

83
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,220
pull in everyone from the organization

84
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,540
they're going to pull in your technical

85
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,420
folks your it teams your security teams

86
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,000
database teams basically anyone and

87
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,340
everyone from the it function but it's

88
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,659
also going to pull in your business side

89
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:18,980
so your HR Finance legal

90
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:22,379
physical security so the folks

91
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:24,180
responsible for your Access Control

92
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,640
Systems

93
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,920
um technical table tops are also uh

94
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,379
pretty common technical it's really just

95
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:32,640
going to be your technical folks that

96
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,980
you have in the room the topic itself is

97
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,420
going to be more technical in nature

98
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,340
it's going to be how are we pulling logs

99
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,140
from systems

100
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,659
um how are we going to segment our

101
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:44,580
network if we need to so if we need to

102
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,900
segment part of our Network in the

103
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,099
middle of an incident how do we go about

104
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:50,040
that if we need to isolate our endpoints

105
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,780
what's the process to isolate our

106
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,580
endpoints do we have a solution that we

107
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,080
can quickly isolate those do we have

108
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,239
Auto isolation turned on on our xdr

109
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:00,840
solution can we quickly and easily

110
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,939
isolate those systems or do we have to

111
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:05,640
basically jump through hoops also do we

112
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,379
have the authorization to just go and

113
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:09,299
isolate systems or isolate the internet

114
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:10,920
we're going to talk about all of that

115
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,900
during those technical types of

116
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,239
exercises

117
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:17,519
um executive tabletops those are really

118
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,759
focused on your executive level

119
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,860
executive management your C Level the

120
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,000
folks that are going to be making the

121
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,320
decisions about if we're going to pay

122
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,680
ransomware uh if we're we are going to

123
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,000
disconnect from the internet if we're

124
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,680
going to stop our business for a certain

125
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,020
reason uh talking about various things

126
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,240
that that executive level that they're

127
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,040
going to have to make those decisions

128
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,900
and then a unique type of exercise

129
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,300
called a functional exercise this is

130
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,580
really a tabletop exercise but it builds

131
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,560
in some Hands-On components where you're

132
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,040
going to actually pull logs you may have

133
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,720
a laptop that you need to isolate you

134
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,780
may need to pull some something off of a

135
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,240
server maybe someone plants a fig piece

136
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,440
of malware out there and you want them

137
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,240
to go and grab it so it's going to have

138
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,039
some Hands-On component during the

139
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:04,500
actual exercise where you get to

140
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,259
actually test and practice what you're

141
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:10,160
doing during the exercise

142
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,560
um so during a tabletop and during fire

143
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,780
training having a white hat

144
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,580
um buy-in is critical so when I say

145
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,800
white hat in the fire service you see

146
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,360
the chief officers usually the guy

147
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,100
wearing the white helmet usually the

148
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,259
cranky guy with Outside the Fire not

149
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:26,940
doing anything looks like he's holding

150
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,340
up the truck that's usually your chief

151
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,360
officer

152
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,000
but you want to have their by enduring

153
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,800
fire training the reason for that is

154
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,840
they're ultimately responsible for our

155
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,419
safety so at the end of the day if

156
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:40,680
something happens during that fire

157
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,720
they're going to be the one held

158
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,919
responsible and it's going to come back

159
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,199
to them it's the same thing with our

160
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,120
with our tabletop exercise with security

161
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,460
in our organization those Executives at

162
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,860
the top ultimately are responsible for

163
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,419
the security of our organizations so we

164
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:56,400
want their buy-in not only is it

165
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,199
critical for the safety of the

166
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:01,319
organization but also it shows support

167
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:04,020
for your exercise you want to have

168
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,759
attendance in your exercise you want the

169
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,139
organizations to know how important

170
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:09,780
these exercises are so you need to make

171
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,300
sure that you have the executive buy-in

172
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,979
or an executive sponsor for your

173
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:16,319
tabletop it's really going to help

174
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,900
during that exercise and get the support

175
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,859
of the organization

176
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,539
all right so going to talk about uh when

177
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:27,479
we perform tabletop exercises uh so I

178
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:29,280
asked earlier about you know how often

179
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,840
you do these people have done them in

180
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,120
the last year in the last quarter

181
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,620
um highly recommend having these

182
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,319
tabletops at least once a quarter I know

183
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:39,600
that seems like a lot but the reason

184
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,259
being is the more we practice this stuff

185
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:45,900
the better we're going to get at it the

186
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,240
last thing you want is to be blindsided

187
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,099
by an incident something that you're not

188
00:06:50,099 --> 00:06:51,780
aware of something that you're not quite

189
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,900
sure how to handle so by doing this on a

190
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,660
quarterly basis we can practice things

191
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,880
that we may be weak at there may be

192
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,259
something that's keeping you up at night

193
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:02,819
keeping management up at night that we

194
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:04,740
need to practice and work on so we're

195
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,240
going to have that in our tabletop

196
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,419
exercise as as a topic so that we can

197
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:10,800
practice with it

198
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,199
uh firefighters you know we have weekly

199
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,240
training activities for the volunteer

200
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,580
service which I'm in we have a weekly

201
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,259
training that we go to it's usually two

202
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:21,539
to three hours the topic changes from

203
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:23,099
week to week

204
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:24,539
um you know as as a volunteer

205
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:25,740
organization we don't always get

206
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,139
everyone there every week but we do what

207
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:30,180
we can with who we have

208
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,560
so we're going to have those weekly

209
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,919
trainings there's also 200 plus hours of

210
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:36,360
basic training

211
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,460
in order to be a firefighter in PA you

212
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,139
have to go through 200 hours of basic

213
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:42,240
firefighter training and then there's

214
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,860
additional training on top of that

215
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,099
that's just to become proficient at or

216
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:48,539
learning the basics really of

217
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:50,520
firefighting it's really the same thing

218
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,900
with instant response you're not going

219
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,460
to be able to go in day one and know

220
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,259
exactly what you're doing how to respond

221
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:57,840
how to do your job in incident response

222
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,919
you're not going to know where to look

223
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:00,720
for what to look for you're not going to

224
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,160
know what logs you have you're not going

225
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,960
to know what systems you have in place

226
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,360
so we need to practice this on a regular

227
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,699
basis

228
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:10,139
um the more we practice the better we're

229
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:12,900
going to get at it I have listed there

230
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,400
from the firefighter perspective the

231
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,099
additional classes for various skills we

232
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:19,860
do things in the basic training it's you

233
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,539
know basic firefighter training how to

234
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:23,580
score the hose how to put out the fire

235
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,560
and things like that those additional

236
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,300
classes we're going to learn things like

237
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,300
basic vehicle rescue where we're going

238
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,159
to learn how to extricate people from

239
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,760
vehicles from from vehicle crashes it

240
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,320
might be a chemical spill so we might

241
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,779
have a Hazmat class to go through how to

242
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:42,419
properly maintain contain that Hazmat

243
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:45,959
situation how to properly contain The

244
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:47,640
Spill and what have you and clean it up

245
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,920
and also goes into the different types

246
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,540
of chemicals and how far back you need

247
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,640
to stay and how far upwind you should be

248
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,640
and what evacuation needs to be and

249
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,920
whatnot so we have those additional

250
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,140
classes for the various skills it's a

251
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,940
similar thing with our instant response

252
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,220
so if we we go through different types

253
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,320
of scenarios you know we might have

254
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,540
ransomware era that we practice one

255
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,940
quarter we might have a stolen laptop

256
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,620
the next quarter we might have a data

257
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,779
breach the next quarter so it gets us to

258
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:18,360
practice different types of incidents

259
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,920
that may occur within an organization

260
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,140
certainly want them to be relevant we

261
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,060
don't want to be walking through a

262
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,100
tabletop for some application or tool

263
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,380
that we don't have

264
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,700
but we do want to make sure that we are

265
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,399
practicing on relevant topics and doing

266
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,440
the various skills and tools that we

267
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,940
have in place

268
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:39,480
so when should we do tabletops there may

269
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,160
be a regulatory requirement for it so

270
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,019
some organizations have some regulatory

271
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:45,000
requirement around needing to have a

272
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,640
tabletop annually I highly encourage you

273
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,860
if that is your case don't just check

274
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,140
the box don't go through the basic steps

275
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,600
make it relevant make it work for the

276
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,000
organization bring in as many people as

277
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,940
you can to that exercise a good exercise

278
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:03,000
has about 10 to 15 people in it you can

279
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,260
certainly go more than that you can

280
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,180
certainly go less than that but 10 to 15

281
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,600
is a great kind of average to have in

282
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,820
the room it really gets the engagement

283
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,100
going it gets those folks that may not

284
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,899
necessarily be familiar especially on a

285
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:18,620
cross-functional tabletop gets them

286
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,540
involved in knowing the risks to the

287
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,000
organization

288
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,640
um so regulatory requirements are one

289
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,779
anytime you have new staff members

290
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:29,820
whether it be on the business side if

291
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,079
they're going to be involved in instant

292
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:33,480
response or the technical side uh if

293
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,740
it's especially if it's their first time

294
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,540
an incident response in an incident

295
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,579
response capacity

296
00:10:38,579 --> 00:10:40,860
um walk through a tabletop exercise with

297
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,660
them it could be just a very basic one

298
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:46,200
but get them get their feet wet get them

299
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,480
help them to understand what the instant

300
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,459
response plan is what it's like what's

301
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:52,200
in there what they should and shouldn't

302
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,660
do shouldn't and shouldn't do and what

303
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,180
they can and can't do our incident

304
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,700
response plan I mentioned that so that

305
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,320
instant response plan really should

306
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,300
spell out the steps that we should take

307
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,120
during our tabletop exercise it should

308
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,740
have everything we can do as an instant

309
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,519
response team and everything we can't do

310
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:12,540
realistically it should say whether or

311
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,740
not we can disconnect the internet

312
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,420
without having to go up the chain if we

313
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,040
have to go up the chain it should it

314
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,880
should say that in there

315
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,140
so we really want that uh instant

316
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,300
response plan to be spelled out and our

317
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,620
new staff members to know what that

318
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,660
instant response plan is and a tabletop

319
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,459
is one way to test that

320
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:31,740
anytime we update the incident response

321
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,140
plan we should be holding a tabletop

322
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,420
exercise so we made a change we want to

323
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,880
make sure that change is effective so

324
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,860
we're going to test and perform a

325
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,959
tabletop exercise

326
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,399
and then if we have new tools and

327
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,079
processes in place especially for new

328
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,300
tools we may have some new Tools in

329
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,760
place so we want to practice with those

330
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,560
using a

331
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,899
uh you know functional exercise so we

332
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:56,880
can actually grab some some disc images

333
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,100
grab some memory during those exercises

334
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,660
we're going to test those new tools and

335
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,040
processes

336
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,079
key thing to remember is consistency

337
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,540
unless you're not doing them at all

338
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:10,279
don't consistently not do them

339
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,860
um so who designs and runs the show

340
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,779
um so I'm using two terms here designer

341
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:17,639
and facilitator different organizations

342
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:18,779
are going to call these different

343
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,300
different things but for the purposes

344
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,100
here the designer really is that person

345
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,160
that is creating the tabletop exercise

346
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,839
you want that Designer to be someone

347
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,519
that knows the organization and knows

348
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,339
the organization well so once you you

349
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:33,899
have a topic in mind you're going to

350
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:36,180
select that topic you want that Designer

351
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,279
to know what business functions and what

352
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:39,779
technical folks need to be in that

353
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:42,660
tabletop exercise it needs to be someone

354
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,579
that knows what tools are in place it

355
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:46,620
needs to be someone that knows what

356
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,240
technology is in place What new

357
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,060
technologies are out there what

358
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,800
um what risks there are to the

359
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,600
organization so I mentioned this earlier

360
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,700
but you certainly want to make it

361
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,920
something a risk that is out there for

362
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,360
the organization and not something

363
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,220
that's non-existent so I'll use the

364
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:05,579
example of G Suite so say you have G

365
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:07,560
Suite in the environment you certainly

366
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,720
don't want your tabletop exercise to be

367
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,519
on an exchange vulnerability that's not

368
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,139
going to be relevant or useful for the

369
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:15,420
organization it's really not going to be

370
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,980
helpful at all you might have some

371
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,560
takeaways from that but ultimately

372
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,760
you're looking at a risk that doesn't

373
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,160
exist for your organization

374
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,779
uh you want this person to be

375
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:26,940
experienced they don't necessarily have

376
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,560
to be a person that's done a tabletop

377
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,260
exercise before or ran one before but

378
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,480
they certainly should have ex expertise

379
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,000
and experience within the I.T and the

380
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,860
security field you don't want someone

381
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,839
just coming in blindly running the show

382
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,540
or building this exercise without any

383
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,160
experience without knowing technology

384
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,980
without understanding technology without

385
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,540
understanding the network so someone

386
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,980
that is experienced within the

387
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,180
organization

388
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,740
you want them to know the incident

389
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,959
response plan and also no process guides

390
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,000
and playbooks

391
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,279
um so I mentioned playbooks and process

392
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,600
guys if you're not familiar with those

393
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,000
terms essentially it's an add-on or

394
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,620
extension to your instant response plan

395
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,360
where it's going to walk through a

396
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,600
specific type of incident and basically

397
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,980
inform you how to respond to that

398
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,180
incident it's going to give you action

399
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,160
steps and steps to take throughout that

400
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,180
incident

401
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,519
but you want this designer to know the

402
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,959
incident response plan and know those

403
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,360
playbooks and process guides so they can

404
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,279
think ahead hey this is how they're

405
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,320
probably going to respond to this that

406
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,240
way they can build that and try and

407
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,600
Throw Some Loops in there throw some

408
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,760
something in there to throw throw the

409
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:36,120
the uh the responders or the people in

410
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,639
the incident um in the table top off so

411
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,380
you want to you want that person to know

412
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,760
those items

413
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,220
uh the facilitator the facilitator may

414
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,139
or may not be the same person as that

415
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:47,760
Designer

416
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,019
um so the

417
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:51,000
um you usually want the facilitator to

418
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,940
be a neutral party uh so for for me I

419
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,540
typically go into various organizations

420
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,860
um

421
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,560
as the neutral party so the information

422
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,779
I get from them is what they give me

423
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:07,199
I've walked into tabletops where the

424
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,940
company is very forthright they'll give

425
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,040
me the information they'll let me know

426
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,139
everything I ask you know I'll ask about

427
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:15,120
the technology about the landscape about

428
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,639
the network those are great tabletops

429
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:18,899
you can really build out a great

430
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:20,600
tabletop for them

431
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,399
and and really make it relevant for the

432
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:24,600
organization I've worked with other

433
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,399
organizations where they don't like to

434
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,199
give you any information they want you

435
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:29,880
to come up with a scenario on its own

436
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,779
your own it makes it a lot harder for us

437
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:36,139
as as an instant response third party

438
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:38,459
because we have to try and develop a

439
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:41,519
tabletop in a basically in a chamber but

440
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,920
we come in as a neutral third party and

441
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,420
that neutral party can be someone in

442
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,579
your organization or someone outside but

443
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:50,399
someone that is really not going to be

444
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,920
biased during the the tabletop exercise

445
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:57,060
um you want that facilitator to take

446
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,339
notes throughout the exercise one of the

447
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:01,920
end goals of the exercise should be to

448
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,899
point out what went well during the

449
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:05,759
exercise what strengths the organization

450
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,459
organization has but also and more

451
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:10,680
importantly what weaknesses there are so

452
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,120
we talked about having those quarterly

453
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,519
tabletop exercise

454
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,019
exercises when you find weaknesses

455
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:17,940
something you can do in the next quarter

456
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,519
is exercise those weaknesses so you can

457
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:22,259
take a look at what those weaknesses are

458
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:24,240
and build the table top around those

459
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,160
weaknesses to see if you've improved

460
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,860
over the last quarter

461
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,480
um so that facilitator should be taking

462
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,420
those notes and helping to point out the

463
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,420
strengths and areas of improvement

464
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:39,420
from a firefighting uh perspective

465
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,339
the training officers are usually going

466
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:43,320
to be your Captain's lieutenants and

467
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,000
then at the very end the chief so the

468
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,199
chief is typically going to be the

469
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:48,000
person overseeing everything making sure

470
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,160
everything's run safely but oftentimes

471
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,019
those exercises are going to be run by

472
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:54,120
your captains and lieutenants they're

473
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,639
going to be designing the

474
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:58,500
incidents and designing the trainings

475
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,360
and also running the trainings

476
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,399
themselves

477
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,500
captains lieutenants in the fire service

478
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,059
they're usually the people going into

479
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:08,280
the fire uh responding doing the

480
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,900
Hands-On work with their team so they

481
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,419
usually have depending on your company

482
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:14,280
you're going to have if you're a truck

483
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,780
company and an engine company in your

484
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,220
department you're going to have a truck

485
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:20,220
captain and an engine captain and then a

486
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,299
truck lieutenant and an engine

487
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:22,980
Lieutenant so these are the people that

488
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,319
oversee the Personnel going into and

489
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:28,319
responding to the fires so these are

490
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,760
people that are going to know a lot

491
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,880
about the organization a lot about the

492
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,799
fire service a lot about responding to

493
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,299
incidents they're typically people with

494
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:39,120
a lot of years of experience they really

495
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,280
know their stuff and they can teach

496
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,539
teach others within the organization

497
00:17:44,539 --> 00:17:47,880
oftentimes if you've do we have any

498
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,440
other firefighters in the room I should

499
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,100
ask that other than Mike up here

500
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,440
but when you go to fire training one of

501
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,600
the first things they teach you

502
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,500
is that first and foremost the priority

503
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,980
is your own life safety so the captain's

504
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,140
lieutenants there not only concerned

505
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,299
with their own life safety but then

506
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:11,520
they're responsible for everyone else on

507
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,400
their Cruise Life Safety

508
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,380
so these are the people that are going

509
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,240
to be helping out with with the

510
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,660
trainings

511
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,760
um sorry let me go back real quick that

512
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,260
last part there

513
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,080
um the the training officers they like

514
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,419
the tabletop leader they really need to

515
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:32,640
know the standard operating procedures

516
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,419
in the pre-plans similar to tabletops

517
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:39,179
and similar to our organizations our

518
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:40,620
standard operating procedures are

519
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,059
basically how we're going to operate you

520
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:43,620
can think of that as your incident

521
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,539
response plan you then have your

522
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:48,059
pre-plans which are specific to various

523
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:51,720
types of incidents they may be pre-plans

524
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,580
for high-rise buildings they may be

525
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,340
pre-plans for specific businesses in

526
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,960
your District where it's going to be

527
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,460
exactly how you're going to hook up

528
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,380
where you're going to hook up the hoses

529
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,539
to where you're going to attack from if

530
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:05,039
there is a fire in a certain part of the

531
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:05,960
business

532
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,820
if it's a high-rise or or an apartment

533
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,100
building what the evacuation routes are

534
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,960
for your P for the people living in

535
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,120
those buildings so our pre-plans are

536
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,559
very similar to our playbooks and

537
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,460
process guides

538
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,200
so who's in the room

539
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,120
um it's really going to be dependent on

540
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,980
the type of tabletop exercise you're

541
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,260
running the ones listed here on the

542
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,820
screen are for a cross-functional

543
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,940
exercise so your it and security staff

544
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,980
are going to be in that room and your

545
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,480
business operations folks are going to

546
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,720
be in that room from a business side

547
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,220
it's going to depend on the type of

548
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,960
incident that you have or the type of

549
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,460
scenario that you're going to be walking

550
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,919
through I've recently worked with one

551
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,120
organization

552
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,580
uh where they

553
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,679
um they've got a few business units that

554
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:55,320
don't believe security is their issue or

555
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,880
their problem and they always Point

556
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,039
everything back to the security team

557
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,620
so we're actually building an exercise

558
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:03,960
specifically around an issue in that

559
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,580
specific Department being the HR

560
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,140
department so we're building a scenario

561
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,240
around the HR department it's going to

562
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,539
affect HR data it's going to you know be

563
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:14,580
a compromise of that HR data so we want

564
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,580
those HR people to be in that room the

565
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,740
reason we're doing that exercise that

566
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,020
way is to really show that security is

567
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,620
not an I.T problem only it is more than

568
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,799
that it is also affects the business

569
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:29,940
there's been plenty of talks today

570
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,980
talking about how it security really

571
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,200
needs to be involved with all aspects of

572
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,480
the business it's the same with tabletop

573
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,740
exercises especially the

574
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,840
cross-functional ones we want the

575
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,640
business involved we want them in those

576
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,940
training one for a learning opportunity

577
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,700
uh but two so they can understand what

578
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,340
their role is during the incident

579
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,200
and then for cross-functional having the

580
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,020
c-suite in the room having those c-level

581
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,159
executives

582
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,200
be able to know and understand what the

583
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,059
risks are to the organization for that

584
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,860
specific incident type or that specific

585
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,440
scenario it's a great learning

586
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,480
opportunity for them they may not have

587
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,820
an idea of really what it and security

588
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,799
does so this is one opportunity for them

589
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,419
to learn what you're doing

590
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:15,000
if it's a technical exercise you know

591
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,559
having the right technical folks in the

592
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,559
room you want to make sure if it is an

593
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:21,600
exchange issue that you're going to be

594
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,539
exercising make sure your email staff or

595
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:26,640
an exchange staff are in there make sure

596
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,320
your active directory staff are in there

597
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,600
make sure you're getting those right and

598
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,340
relevant people in the room for that

599
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,639
exercise

600
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,039
um this is where that the white hat or

601
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:40,140
the senior executive level approval or

602
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,360
sponsor comes into play

603
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,640
um you're often or not often but

604
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,380
sometimes you'll get pushed back from

605
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,659
from members of the organization says

606
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:50,940
hey I don't have time for that I you

607
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,860
know that's a waste of my time I'm not

608
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,080
it's never going to happen it's not

609
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,760
going to involve me having that

610
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,980
executive sponsor you can help they can

611
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,840
help to push this exercise in and push

612
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,000
the importance of it they also may have

613
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,340
the pool with with that that person's

614
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,860
management and you can have them offload

615
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,419
some of the work to make sure that they

616
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:11,480
are in there for the exercise

617
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,799
realistically these exercises shouldn't

618
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,200
be long I've had tabletops that have

619
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,059
been an hour long I've had ones that

620
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:20,280
have been four hours long but usually

621
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,080
it's not a full day event you can get

622
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,059
enough people in the room and and really

623
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:26,100
schedule that time to get people

624
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,280
available for that

625
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,280
um from the firefighting perspective

626
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,539
it's very similar we want to have the

627
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:35,039
right people there so the fire

628
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,380
department is obviously there oftentimes

629
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,179
we'll train with other fire departments

630
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:41,940
though in the volunteer service

631
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,340
um in Allegheny County alone there's 296

632
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,919
fire departments

633
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,240
and we need to cross-train with those

634
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,280
other fire departments a daylight call

635
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,320
you know day like this middle of the

636
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,940
afternoon you're probably going to have

637
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,400
five or six stations responding because

638
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,840
you're not going to get the responses

639
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,299
necessary so we need to work well with

640
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:04,559
these other departments around around us

641
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,260
um also EMS and police

642
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,539
EMS and police are often at most fires

643
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:11,400
that we go to whether it be a car

644
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,640
accident a house fire even a false alarm

645
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,440
they're typically going to be dispatched

646
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,940
on these calls with us we need to work

647
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,480
well with these other organizations

648
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,520
if it's a mass casualty incident we need

649
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,900
to know who's going to be responsible

650
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,580
and who's going to be in charge of that

651
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,919
scene same thing with our table tops or

652
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:31,020
with our incidents we need to know who's

653
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,700
going to be responsible and who's in

654
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:36,059
charge of that scene if you will so one

655
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:37,679
way to determine who's going to be in

656
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,780
charge is one our instant response plan

657
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,760
should dictate that but having this

658
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,820
tabletop exercise you know one thing I

659
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,620
like to often do is have that incident

660
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,080
responder or that Incident Commander be

661
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,240
out of the office and unavailable

662
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,340
they're on a vacation so who's going to

663
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,659
take the place of that incident

664
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:57,600
responder that Incident Commander to run

665
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,240
the scene same thing with with the fire

666
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,580
service oftentimes we'll pull people out

667
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:05,100
and say hey you're you're not here that

668
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,919
way we can practice

669
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:08,760
determining who's going to be in charge

670
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,860
and who's going to run that scene

671
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,580
good question

672
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,020
no yeah so they're they'll still be in

673
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,520
the room they'll still be able to listen

674
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,500
in uh oftentimes they'll still answer

675
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,140
questions if it comes to that but I like

676
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,520
to have them

677
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,980
not be there for

678
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,080
not be they're physically present but

679
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,640
not answering and responding to

680
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,140
questions

681
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,419
um that just really gets it's it's

682
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:39,059
usually one of those those topics that

683
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:40,860
comes up where no one really knows who's

684
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,140
going to be in charge of that single

685
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,640
person is out it becomes a single point

686
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,860
of failure it's something that we see

687
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,419
often as a single point of failure

688
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:50,700
within the organization one person that

689
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,940
knows a lot about a lot and then no one

690
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,260
else really knows what's going to happen

691
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,539
if that person's out

692
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:00,059
so that's where you know one of the one

693
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:01,260
of the things we can point out during

694
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,000
that exercise is hey we need to have

695
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,460
backup points of contacts for these

696
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,460
specific roles within the organization

697
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,419
it's the same thing with the fire

698
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:12,179
service if one person's out who's going

699
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:17,000
to be taking that taking that spot

700
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:20,159
all right so

701
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,380
we know who's going to be there we know

702
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,940
what type of exercise we're going to be

703
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,440
doing we know when we're going to be

704
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,179
doing that exercise we're going to start

705
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:29,520
getting it created

706
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,020
um mention this we want to make sure

707
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,120
that it is real and realistic for the

708
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,940
organization so oftentimes we'll have it

709
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,820
be some vulnerability or some software

710
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,860
that is within the organization so it

711
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,600
should be something that can actually

712
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,480
happen to that organization some piece

713
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,039
of software some piece of Hardware

714
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:50,220
that's within the organization

715
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,919
something that is realistically or could

716
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:54,720
actually happen or is more likely to

717
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,520
happen so what are the risks to the

718
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,039
organization a lot of the times when I'm

719
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,840
starting the process I'll ask hey what's

720
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,820
keeping you up at night what is the what

721
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,500
is the biggest thing biggest worry for

722
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,900
the organization or what is keeping

723
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,820
management up you know what are they

724
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,039
worried about and sometimes it comes

725
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,720
down to hey the

726
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,279
um the board of directors is they're

727
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:16,140
worried about this you know another

728
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,840
organization in the same field had this

729
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,279
just happened to them and we want to be

730
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:23,279
prepared if that happens to us so a lot

731
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,779
of the times the scenario is going to be

732
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:26,340
based off of something that's happening

733
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:29,520
either currently or has happened to

734
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,000
someone else

735
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,380
um take solarwinds for example when

736
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,240
solar winds happened

737
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,860
um you know that that affected a lot of

738
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,299
organizations a lot of organizations

739
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:41,039
weren't sure what they would do and how

740
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,020
they would respond to that uh what we

741
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,400
saw right after that was a lot of

742
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,919
organizations wanted a compromise

743
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:49,140
similar to solarwinds so if a piece of

744
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,059
software that affect a lot of companies

745
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:54,000
were using got impacted how would we

746
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,740
respond to that how would we handle that

747
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,380
as an organization so oftentimes we'll

748
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,720
use that as a as an example or use that

749
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,500
as a scenario

750
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,200
um making it relevant so how can we make

751
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,840
it relevant you know

752
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,580
um

753
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:14,880
it's it's one thing to be you know just

754
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,679
you know everyone's doing a ransomware

755
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:18,960
scenario so because everyone else is

756
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,059
doing it let's do it but we want it to

757
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:24,720
be relevant to the organization make it

758
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,700
um something that is actually going to

759
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,220
or could actually happen so

760
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,080
um one scenario that that I recently

761
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,960
developed it was a ransomware scenario

762
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,399
where

763
00:27:35,399 --> 00:27:38,039
um the person came into the organization

764
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:40,020
it was actually a malicious Insider that

765
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,120
that assisted with it and they plugged a

766
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,399
USB into a random server within the

767
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,879
organization

768
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,380
um the impact there was then it then

769
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:53,340
took down the access control system and

770
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,899
allowed physical access into the

771
00:27:54,899 --> 00:27:57,299
building the type of facility that this

772
00:27:57,299 --> 00:27:59,220
was if this actually happened in the

773
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,440
door system actually did go down if they

774
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,419
didn't have enough physical security on

775
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:06,539
site and threat actor or physical actors

776
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:07,860
wanted to actually come in and do

777
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,020
something they would actually they could

778
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,580
easily get into the building and cause

779
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,580
physical harm to people or processes or

780
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,779
technology

781
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:17,760
so you wanted to be something that could

782
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,679
legitimately happen to that organization

783
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,880
or to your organization

784
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,340
from the firefighting aspect some things

785
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:29,220
that we do you know will fill fill a

786
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,960
building with smoke we'll get fog

787
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,760
machines and just fill the fill the

788
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,700
building with smoke uh we'll use real

789
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,039
victims sometimes it'll be another

790
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:40,200
firefighter sometimes we'll have you

791
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,419
know someone that's interested in

792
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:43,980
joining or that they're interested in

793
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,240
the fire service they're trying to learn

794
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,720
so they'll come in and be victims for us

795
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,580
you'll often see on the news right

796
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:53,039
around prom time there'll be vehicle

797
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:56,580
axes whereas DUI so we get students

798
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,500
involved and they'll you know be the

799
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,360
victims for those specific scenarios

800
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,880
those type of activities are great PR

801
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,100
for us but it's also a great way for us

802
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,980
to learn from one another and and work

803
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,779
together with with the other teams in

804
00:29:09,779 --> 00:29:11,840
the order in the surrounding Community

805
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,700
it's one thing I've forgot to mention is

806
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,039
that when we are doing tabletop

807
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,260
exercises it is a great way to network

808
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:22,500
with our organization a lot of times you

809
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,299
may they interact with these folks

810
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:26,039
occasionally especially the business

811
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:29,220
side but the tabletop exercise gets you

812
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,320
in the room and gets you to talk one

813
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,700
thing I like to do is especially for

814
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,279
in-person tabletops is have a lunch

815
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,020
break in the middle of it

816
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:40,440
that way you get to interact on a more

817
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,700
personal level you get to know the

818
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,320
people a little bit better get to know

819
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,059
them folks you're going to be working

820
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:47,820
with during that during an incident if

821
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:50,279
one occurs so it's just another way to

822
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:54,179
to build rapport with the organization

823
00:29:54,179 --> 00:29:56,580
um we use live fire scenarios so we'll

824
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,799
actually set things on fire

825
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,480
um I know it's probably doesn't give us

826
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,559
a it doesn't make us look that great but

827
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,779
um you know a lot of times people will

828
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:07,740
say that we're just a bunch of

829
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:10,320
pyromaniacs which might be true

830
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,399
um but um so we do live fire scenarios a

831
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:15,419
lot of times they're going to be at burn

832
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:17,100
buildings if you're out in the North

833
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,600
Hills there's a burn building just

834
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,820
behind Ross Park Mall it's called a fire

835
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,799
tower where we can actually we can use

836
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,440
it it's just a concrete structure which

837
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,260
we can set up scenarios there North Park

838
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,240
there is the fire academy where you

839
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,340
could go out to and they have a barn

840
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,740
building there as well it's really meant

841
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,500
for you to get Hands-On with fire it

842
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,360
allows you to watch how the fire has

843
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,059
developed how the fire grows and

844
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:45,539
ultimately how to extinguish those fires

845
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:47,340
um and then mass casualty incidents are

846
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,860
big you know unfortunately we see them

847
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,779
all over the news uh something that we

848
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:53,760
need to be prepared for

849
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,360
um as as First Responders but you can

850
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,340
consider mass casualty incidents you

851
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,720
know they're similar to in our

852
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,899
organization if we have a high scale uh

853
00:31:03,899 --> 00:31:05,340
incident you know rain somewhere

854
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,659
incident where everything's encrypted

855
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:08,700
we're going to need all hands on decks

856
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,279
so we need to practice with everyone and

857
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,140
anyone

858
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:17,820
so a few fun fun facts PA has the most

859
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,539
Fire Departments of any state so there's

860
00:31:20,539 --> 00:31:23,640
1799 fire departments in the state of

861
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,860
Pennsylvania with over 90 percent of

862
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,380
those being

863
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,519
volunteer fully volunteer fire

864
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,399
departments and then 96 of the

865
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,440
Departments are actually almost fully

866
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,380
volunteer and by that it means there are

867
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:41,100
a few paid paid drivers usually but the

868
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,120
rest are volunteer

869
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:47,159
uh so with that that really takes me to

870
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:48,240
the end

871
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,340
um this fire here uh this is one of

872
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,799
those uh times that we had acquired a

873
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,779
building and basically used it to train

874
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:57,899
in and then uh the community wanted it

875
00:31:57,899 --> 00:32:00,779
gone so we burned it to the ground uh

876
00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:04,519
anyways any questions

877
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:23,399
four letter would be

878
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:26,820
prepared people in the absence of

879
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,340
your apartment isn't there or

880
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,840
whatever so that

881
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,399
or is that just a bad idea to get people

882
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,500
who

883
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,539
really aren't qualified to take the

884
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:38,159
first initial steps that's a great

885
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:40,919
question so help desk I'll use help desk

886
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:42,480
for an example typically these aren't

887
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,279
people that necessarily know a lot about

888
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:46,799
security but they're a great first line

889
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:50,460
of defense for us the help desk for

890
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,720
example they need to know what to look

891
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,820
out for

892
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:55,679
so oftentimes most organizations the

893
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,240
help desk if you have an issue

894
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,799
especially with a Windows system you

895
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,840
call in and they tell you to turn it off

896
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,240
and back on again which in most cases

897
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,919
it's going to fix the problem but from a

898
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:07,019
security perspective when it comes to

899
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:08,640
memory a lot of our malware and whatnot

900
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,559
is running in memory so if we turn it

901
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:11,820
off and back on again we're going to

902
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,320
lose any evidence that was on that

903
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,380
system so we want everyone really on

904
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,059
that front line to be prepared and know

905
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:22,080
what to look out for so having them with

906
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,000
the ability to to know what to look out

907
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,940
for and know how to respond are we going

908
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:30,000
to let them you know if if we do have an

909
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,159
issue and we suspect it's an incident do

910
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,440
we want them remoting in with admin

911
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,460
controls to that box box maybe maybe not

912
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:40,200
if they do remote in what's the chances

913
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,000
of those credentials being compromised

914
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,519
because they logged in with a plain text

915
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,440
username password over RDP or do we have

916
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,840
some other tool that we can use

917
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:52,320
also if if we've gotten EDR solution in

918
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,600
place where we can isolate our endpoints

919
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,419
having those help desk folks know

920
00:33:57,419 --> 00:33:59,159
exactly how to go about that where they

921
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:01,019
can quickly isolate those endpoints for

922
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:02,000
us

923
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,260
when it comes to ransomware that could

924
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,880
make or break the incident if it's the

925
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,159
first or second endpoint that is

926
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,960
impacted with that ransomware and we

927
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,239
could stop it right then having those

928
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,460
individuals know what to do in that case

929
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,199
is certainly going to help stop the

930
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:18,899
spread we certainly don't want anyone

931
00:34:18,899 --> 00:34:21,719
and everyone in the organization

932
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:23,460
um you know you're not necessarily going

933
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,859
to want your business folks responding

934
00:34:25,859 --> 00:34:29,219
necessarily to to do I.T and incident

935
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:31,560
response functions but having the

936
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,060
organization as a whole know what to

937
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,560
look out for and when to report an

938
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,540
incident

939
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:39,300
I use this as an example you know we've

940
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,280
had incidents where it's Friday

941
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,320
afternoon

942
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,179
and computers acting funny person

943
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:46,500
doesn't really know what's going on and

944
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,760
they don't really feel like dealing with

945
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,460
it so it's a desktop computer they leave

946
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:53,579
it on over the weekend which is you know

947
00:34:53,579 --> 00:34:55,859
usually what they do anyways but that

948
00:34:55,859 --> 00:34:57,780
was you know patient zero with

949
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:00,599
ransomware or some infection which ended

950
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:01,740
up spreading throughout the rest of the

951
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:04,200
environment over the weekend because the

952
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,240
organization had no end point response

953
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,980
in place they had no visibility into the

954
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,680
endpoints so that incident escalated

955
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,320
quickly because that person didn't

956
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,300
report the incident up to who they

957
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,940
needed to so we really need to have the

958
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:20,040
organization aware of what to look out

959
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,960
for who to report it to and what to

960
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,240
report and when

961
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,800
last thing you wanted someone just

962
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,300
holding on to information that could

963
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,260
have ultimately helped

964
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:33,000
does that answer your questions

965
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,420
okay

966
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,419
terrible

967
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,579
uh yeah so from a firefighting

968
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:48,720
perspective

969
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,020
um it's it's not good

970
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,020
um like our company that I belong to

971
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,220
you're lucky if we get out during the

972
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,920
day we don't have most of the people

973
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,200
work nine to five so the engine just

974
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,780
doesn't get out and people are are

975
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,000
afraid to join you know there's that 200

976
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,800
plus hours of basic firefighting

977
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,859
requirement and in most fire companies

978
00:36:10,859 --> 00:36:12,540
you have to complete that Essentials

979
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,859
before you can actually go into a

980
00:36:13,859 --> 00:36:15,660
building and actually fight the fire so

981
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,700
it really turns people off because they

982
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,800
have to do a year plus of training

983
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,780
before they can actually do anything and

984
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,460
help out

985
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,900
um there are some school districts that

986
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,700
are helping with that I know the North

987
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,260
Hills School District they have a

988
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,579
program that's going to be starting up

989
00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:31,320
to get

990
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,079
um get more volunteers firefighters in

991
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:35,940
place they'll actually end up graduating

992
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,160
with I think it's firefighter one which

993
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,420
is

994
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,980
um you have your basic firefighting and

995
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,540
then firefighter one which is the next

996
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,820
step so you end up graduating with that

997
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:48,420
which is which is great for us but as

998
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,400
far as we're too retention and

999
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,280
recruitment it's it's not not great we

1000
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,160
uh Pennsylvania used to be have the most

1001
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,140
Volunteers in the nation but I know that

1002
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,240
number is is dwindling and dwindling

1003
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:05,040
rapidly I think in in the company I'm in

1004
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:05,880
um

1005
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,920
we've got two junior members which

1006
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,380
basically means they're under 18.

1007
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,940
otherwise everyone that is in the

1008
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,680
department has been there for 10 plus

1009
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,919
years

1010
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,859
any other questions fire related or

1011
00:37:19,859 --> 00:37:23,480
incident response related

1012
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,160
yeah so

1013
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,740
um good question so one one thing we do

1014
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,660
in the fire department and it's a great

1015
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,000
thing to do after tables are not

1016
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,980
tabletops but actual incidents is it's

1017
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:46,140
called a Lessons Learned where you're

1018
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,880
going to take what went well and what

1019
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,220
didn't go well and really evaluate that

1020
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:52,200
so from an incident response perspective

1021
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,460
you're going to look at the people

1022
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:56,640
processes and Technology

1023
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,560
so what people responded to that

1024
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,180
incident did we have the right people in

1025
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,520
the room did those people know exactly

1026
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,200
what they were supposed to do or was

1027
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,599
there some Gap in knowledge that they

1028
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:07,740
didn't know that they were supposed to

1029
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:09,240
do or they didn't have the correct

1030
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,280
training

1031
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,900
or just weren't sure what was going on

1032
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,880
if that's the case you know having

1033
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,800
tabletops and having regular training is

1034
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,980
going to help that person

1035
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:21,180
processes so where the process is

1036
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:24,480
correct that we had in place so did we

1037
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,460
follow them all properly so did we

1038
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,680
isolate first or did we just go in and

1039
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,060
start collecting evidence before we

1040
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,760
isolated those endpoints was there some

1041
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,859
process that that just didn't work for

1042
00:38:34,859 --> 00:38:36,540
us

1043
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,579
um and then technology

1044
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:40,320
um so did we have the right technology

1045
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,839
in place the right resources in place

1046
00:38:42,839 --> 00:38:45,720
from a technology perspective something

1047
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,880
something that we've encountered as an

1048
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,320
organization is

1049
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,940
the organization thinks that they have

1050
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,859
all their endpoints covered with an EDR

1051
00:38:52,859 --> 00:38:55,140
solution turns out there was a segment

1052
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,400
of their Network they didn't even know

1053
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,040
about that was impacted you know all the

1054
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,540
alerts are coming in it looks like we

1055
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,400
have all the data but there was a whole

1056
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,720
section of the network completely

1057
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,640
missing so we were completely missing

1058
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,740
all the data off those endpoints so

1059
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,180
maybe the solution there was getting

1060
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,859
that eer solution rolled out on

1061
00:39:10,859 --> 00:39:13,040
everything

1062
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,140
turn it to the fire department side it's

1063
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,180
really the same thing

1064
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,680
um you know what went well what didn't

1065
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,599
go well from the response perspective

1066
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:23,880
you know did the police show up and park

1067
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,260
right in front of the fire hydrant

1068
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:27,359
probably because that's what they do

1069
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:28,200
um

1070
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,760
you know but

1071
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,900
um just joking aside did we

1072
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:37,380
um something we see often with

1073
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,359
with I mean I won't even say with new

1074
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:41,640
firefighters is did they just drop the

1075
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,619
hose in the front yard and then it's

1076
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:45,060
just Tangled mess and then you're trying

1077
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,440
to run into the building with a hose

1078
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,660
that is just completely Tangled so then

1079
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:51,300
you're wasting time there

1080
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:54,680
um did we do everything safely one thing

1081
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:57,480
we unfortunately don't always do

1082
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,760
correctly is safety

1083
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,380
um so was there something we should have

1084
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:03,980
done better from a safety perspective

1085
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:07,140
in the U.S For Better or Worse something

1086
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:09,119
we often do is run into the burning

1087
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,619
building and try and put the fire out if

1088
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:12,780
you go over to Europe unless there is

1089
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,700
someone's life at risk oftentimes you're

1090
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,560
going to stay outside of the building so

1091
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,599
we need to wait weigh the pros and cons

1092
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:21,599
there is there a need to go in is is

1093
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:22,619
there something we could have done

1094
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:25,880
better we've gone into fires where

1095
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,700
unfortunately there is a person inside

1096
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:31,200
and did we find them quick enough is

1097
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,160
there something we could have done

1098
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,040
better to find the victim so there's a

1099
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,420
lot of things that we need to evaluate

1100
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:39,599
after that fire or after that incident

1101
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,160
to determine if there's something we

1102
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,819
could have done better

1103
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:46,640
great question

1104
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,480
uh the the police officer yeah

1105
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,780
um yeah I don't actually know him but

1106
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,280
um that's usually what they look like

1107
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,380
when they're when they're at the scenes

1108
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,180
and there's no police officers here

1109
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,380
right

1110
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:08,579
if not uh don't follow me home

1111
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:11,819
but no I uh I just use the stereotypical

1112
00:41:11,819 --> 00:41:13,980
picture there uh usually police are

1113
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,720
great to work with at least where I'm at

1114
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,160
but

1115
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,140
um we have had issues with them parking

1116
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:21,000
in front of higher fire hydrants if you

1117
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,099
go on YouTube I think there's a video up

1118
00:41:23,099 --> 00:41:25,200
in New York uh where the fire truck

1119
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,119
actually pushed the uh

1120
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:29,579
push the police car out of the way

1121
00:41:29,579 --> 00:41:33,440
with the with the apparatus

1122
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,700
any other questions

1123
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,660
yeah no that's a good question

1124
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,400
um I would say from for the most part

1125
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:57,119
fire while regulated it's not it's not

1126
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,980
too bad we don't

1127
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:01,500
uh there's not a ton of oversight unless

1128
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:04,380
something goes wrong that's when

1129
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:07,500
fit hits the Shan if you will

1130
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,520
um

1131
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,460
yeah yeah I mean usually usually it's

1132
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:13,079
pretty hands-off

1133
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:15,240
um and our regulation regulations are

1134
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,220
coming from the government but as long

1135
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:19,020
as we're doing everything properly then

1136
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:21,900
then there's no issues if there is an

1137
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,700
incident there's going to be if there's

1138
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,980
an issue something happens God forbid

1139
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,480
someone gets killed on a fire scene

1140
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,859
there's going to be an investigation

1141
00:42:28,859 --> 00:42:30,420
into that to determine what happened

1142
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:33,300
what was the cause all that stuff and

1143
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:37,140
then ultimately whose fault is it

1144
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:40,140
um incident response it's it's a lot

1145
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,700
different there's a lot more regulations

1146
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,280
uh there's different you know there's

1147
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:49,319
PCI Phi HIPAA you know all those gdpr so

1148
00:42:49,319 --> 00:42:51,540
you've got a number of balls in the air

1149
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:54,240
that you have to watch out for it's

1150
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,760
really uh if I could say anything about

1151
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:59,099
regulatory requirements is go above and

1152
00:42:59,099 --> 00:43:01,440
beyond don't just check the box I know

1153
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,560
it's easier to just check the box

1154
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:07,020
but really go and do your due diligence

1155
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,579
make sure you're mitigating the risk

1156
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:11,520
fully as opposed to just doing the bare

1157
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,740
minimum

1158
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:16,579
I think there's a parallel there to to

1159
00:43:16,579 --> 00:43:20,160
like with security

1160
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,740
air this distraction from the business

1161
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:24,720
until something bad happens and then

1162
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,359
you're a necessary evil right similar

1163
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:30,060
with the fire service like until we get

1164
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:32,339
to a point where we take it

1165
00:43:32,339 --> 00:43:34,020
on the road during the day because we

1166
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:37,040
don't have enough volunteers

1167
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,119
there's a that's an interesting parallel

1168
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:47,940
as well yeah I think for in PA I think

1169
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:49,619
you're going to see it change it's going

1170
00:43:49,619 --> 00:43:52,020
to be a slow change but with 96 percent

1171
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:54,960
being volunteers still

1172
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:55,859
um

1173
00:43:55,859 --> 00:43:57,900
you know something's going to have to

1174
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:00,180
give and unfortunately it's going to be

1175
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:01,740
that worst case scenario that's actually

1176
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:02,819
going to

1177
00:44:02,819 --> 00:44:04,440
change the minds of people to actually

1178
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:08,000
move to paid departments but

1179
00:44:10,859 --> 00:44:12,800
um so my contact information is up there

1180
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,940
uh there's a chance to win some money

1181
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:18,240
over there or might be a random Youtube

1182
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,800
video

1183
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,180
um I figured you all probably get your

1184
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:24,420
phones out right now and scan that right

1185
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:27,240
just like during the Super Bowl

1186
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,800
all right

1187
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,960
if nothing else thanks for your time

1188
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,050
appreciate it

1189
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:36,269
[Applause]
