1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,599
thank you all for coming today i

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:03,439
appreciate it

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:05,759
and thank you for attending the 10th

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,440
anniversary of b-sides pittsburgh that's

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,599
pretty cool

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:10,639
so

7
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,160
there's an awful lot to talk about

8
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,360
stopping ransomware and

9
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,320
threat hunting is part of it and

10
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,800
what i wanted to do today

11
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,279
was

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,560
talk a little bit about some of the some

13
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,320
of the threat hunting things that people

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,679
kind of miss

15
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,000
when it comes to ransomware

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,239
this actually started as a thread on

17
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,239
twitter so actually

18
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,280
twitter can be useful sometimes who knew

19
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,200
but it turned out to be really good with

20
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,600
a lot of really good advice and inputs

21
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,920
from a lot of people that do dfir for a

22
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,760
living so uh really appreciate it um if

23
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,440
you're wondering about the title i am

24
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,840
the ransomware smallier which means that

25
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,079
i do help you pair the right ransomware

26
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,480
with the flaws in your network so

27
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,640
you know if you don't have mfa enabled

28
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,879
i'll give you a nice lock bit um you

29
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,239
know whereas

30
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,119
if you have mfa enabled but maybe you're

31
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:08,000
not

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,320
monitoring your endpoint solutions i'll

33
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,439
get you a copy of alpha v or black cat

34
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,479
so

35
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:15,280
um

36
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,960
before we get into this let's talk about

37
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,000
the state of ransomware uh so far this

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,600
year we've seen

39
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,759
it's actually more like 1700 victims

40
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,040
posted to ransomware extortion sites um

41
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,119
and ransomware extortion sites for

42
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,280
reference are becoming

43
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,920
a less effective measure

44
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,479
of uh the number of ransomware attacks

45
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,240
in the world than they were in than it

46
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,680
was in like 2020 and early 2021 a lot of

47
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,360
ransomware groups

48
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,000
while some are relying even more heavily

49
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,640
on their extortion sites others are

50
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,360
others are

51
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,200
using less

52
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,520
using their assortment sites less

53
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,759
we've also seen 28 law enforcement

54
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,759
actions taken against ransomware groups

55
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,880
in the last year which is more than we

56
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,360
saw in the previous uh

57
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,440
five years combined

58
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,959
um so

59
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,360
and when we're we're talking about

60
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,400
even russia getting involved with uh

61
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,959
uh with arresting um some members of

62
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,640
rival and then of course a few months

63
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,560
later letting them go so that they can

64
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,480
go work for the russian government so

65
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,920
you know that's great

66
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,560
um but we aren't just seeing um

67
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,800
indictments and sanctions we're actually

68
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,840
seeing uh ransomware actors being

69
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,160
extradited to the u.s and you know

70
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,959
standing trial which is again great we'd

71
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,040
love to see that

72
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,519
but of course as you all know right now

73
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,599
it's not slowing down ransomware attacks

74
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,319
uh if anything other than a break in

75
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,319
june because even ransomware actors have

76
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,239
to go on vacation

77
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,160
we've pretty much seen an acceleration

78
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,560
in ransomware attacks this year so we're

79
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,120
still talking about lots of whack-a-mole

80
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,360
but the reason that i'm excited about

81
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,959
all the law enforcement activity that

82
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,280
we're seeing worldwide

83
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,200
is that

84
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,120
um

85
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,080
you know

86
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,400
whack-a-mole's a sport like any other

87
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,800
so if you go out to coney island or

88
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,920
kennywood i guess since we're in

89
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,319
pittsburgh if you got to kennywood twice

90
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,080
a year and play whack-a-mole you're

91
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,599
going to get okay at it but you're never

92
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,879
going to be really good at it if you

93
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,560
want to be a professional whack-a-mole

94
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,720
player you got to go out to kennywood

95
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,040
like you know every week and and

96
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,360
practice your whack-a-mole skills and

97
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,040
that's where i think we're doing we're

98
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,280
early on in that process and so the

99
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,840
sanctions the the you know

100
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,920
intergovernmental cooperation and all

101
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,120
that are having an impact

102
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,440
it's not as fast as we'd like but law

103
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,360
enforcement never moves as fast as we'd

104
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,519
like so i think it's good that we're

105
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,440
seeing that and i know we're all cynical

106
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,120
and infosec but i do think it's good and

107
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,480
i think eventually we'll see good

108
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,560
returns from this activity

109
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,319
one of the other things that's kind of

110
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,920
concerning this year

111
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,080
is in the last six months we've seen 60

112
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,560
new ransomware variants launched so 60

113
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,560
new groups

114
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,560
none of them using new code a lot of

115
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,920
them are using

116
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,480
stolen chaos code stolen county code

117
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,199
stolen rival code

118
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,120
but what we're seeing is a lot of these

119
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,639
new groups don't want to be part of a

120
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,120
larger raz organization

121
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,120
they saw what happened with conti and

122
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,320
the collapse of conti earlier this year

123
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,680
now karakoot mostly um and so what

124
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,199
they're doing is stealing the code and

125
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,639
starting their own

126
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,120
ransomware service uh

127
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,800
generally not offering raz they're

128
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,440
generally just hey it's us five guys and

129
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,440
uh and we're still gonna buy from

130
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,400
initial access brokers and so on um and

131
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,240
we're gonna go out and we're gonna run

132
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,320
our own ransomware operations

133
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,440
so

134
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,280
that may make things harder to track

135
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,520
going forward i mean every day on

136
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,759
twitter i now see or in some of my like

137
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,919
private slack channels and other places

138
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,440
i see people saying hey have you heard

139
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,800
of this variant have you heard of this

140
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,080
variant or have you heard of this

141
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,919
variant because we're just seeing so

142
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,759
many new ones pop up that it's really

143
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,960
difficult to keep track of

144
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,960
so we're also seeing ransomware go

145
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,199
global we're seeing ransomware out of

146
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,440
iran out of china

147
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,120
um uk and brazil with lapses and and you

148
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,560
can argue with me about whether or not

149
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,880
lapses is ransomware but

150
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,600
you know essentially extortion type

151
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,240
groups uh mandiant has a really fancy

152
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,320
word for it because mancy mandian has to

153
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,080
have fancy words for everything i forget

154
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,080
the phrase they use but it's like you

155
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,600
know extortion

156
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,600
groups or whatever and then we just saw

157
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,000
the report about maui operating out of

158
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,560
uh north korea um but of course north

159
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,919
korea has been using other types of

160
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,800
ransomware for years

161
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,039
uh so again extortion is super important

162
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,600
to these ransomware groups now um

163
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,440
more and more companies are doing better

164
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,360
with their backups shockingly it only

165
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,120
took us 10 years of yelling about that

166
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,639
to actually get them to implement

167
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,120
backups so it's great that we're

168
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,639
actually seeing those backups be

169
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,919
implemented and implemented correctly so

170
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,600
not backups oh we saved everything on

171
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,199
the file server that got encrypted we're

172
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,800
actually seeing more offline backups

173
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,319
where we're seeing

174
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,199
uh more backups that are immutable

175
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,639
we're seeing companies going back to

176
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,880
tape which is awesome tape actually

177
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,560
works really well ransomware actors

178
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,000
haven't figured out how to encrypt tape

179
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,440
yet i like that

180
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,800
um

181
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,680
so

182
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,919
that it's you know so that extortion

183
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,919
becomes more important and again as i

184
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,000
said we're seeing groups like lapses

185
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,680
that are extortion only they don't

186
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,440
actually encrypt anything they only

187
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,319
steal files and then demand uh

188
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,479
demand encryption am i moving too much

189
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,240
for you i know you're trying to stream

190
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,600
this i just want to make sure i'm not

191
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,440
like

192
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,199
i'm good okay

193
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,880
um so

194
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,560
if you can extort ransom demand from uh

195
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,800
traditional means uh that blackmail

196
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,120
becomes more important and so we're

197
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,680
seeing this explosion in the uh

198
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,080
extortion ecosystem not just the

199
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,319
sensitive files anymore but uh we've

200
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,880
seen things like uh false media

201
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,039
amplification so we saw this in the nra

202
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,680
ransomware attack last year where

203
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,800
grief paid for false amplification of

204
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,400
mentions of

205
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,599
the nra attack to try and drive

206
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,039
um

207
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,599
to try to try and drive attention to it

208
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,400
and then force the nra to pay

209
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,000
we're seeing some personal attacks i

210
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,360
know some researchers have been

211
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,639
personally

212
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,479
threatened by uh

213
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,199
by uh ransomware groups fortunately for

214
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,840
me i'm not important enough to uh be

215
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,160
threatened and i like that

216
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,680
we're also seeing ransomware actors

217
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,560
reach out to clients so especially in

218
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,800
schools this has become a big problem

219
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,639
they'll encrypt data for schools they'll

220
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,000
steal the data for schools and then

221
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,720
they'll email the parents and say hey

222
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,840
we're going gonna publish your kids

223
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,240
sensitive data to our extortion site

224
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,680
unless you tell the school to pay so um

225
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,680
so we're seeing a lot of these kind of

226
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,479
activities ddos attacks and so on are

227
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,800
really um are really growing in

228
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,440
popularity

229
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,919
and so that's what gets to

230
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,599
the heart of this

231
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,840
um

232
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,479
this the the the extortion

233
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,599
um means that threat actors have to

234
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,440
spend more time in the network and

235
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,440
because they have to spend more time in

236
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,440
the network that means more hands-on

237
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,679
hands on keyboard activity and more

238
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,839
hands-on keyboard activity means there's

239
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,519
actually more opportunity for you as a

240
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,559
defender to catch them

241
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,320
and

242
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,880
i won't sugarcoat this

243
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,880
good threat hunting is hard it takes

244
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,959
planning it takes

245
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,120
knowing and understanding your network

246
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,120
so it's easy for me to come up here and

247
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,120
say oh yeah yeah you got to do threat

248
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,640
hunting blah blah blah

249
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,959
get to it i know it's a lot harder than

250
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,360
that but it is worth it if you can put

251
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,320
together a threat hunting program

252
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,480
um we do need to talk about dwell time

253
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,320
though so dwell time for those of you

254
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,320
who don't know is the time that they

255
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,800
keep the the attackers spend inside the

256
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,000
network you will see over and over again

257
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,680
this quote of 43 days for dwell time

258
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,720
please don't take that as gospel it is

259
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,720
a lot sooner than that

260
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,640
it's not quite as soon as i know i've

261
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,360
seen like dfi report has uh has

262
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,440
published you know from you know initial

263
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,839
intrusion to ransomware in five hours

264
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,640
it's not quite that bad but generally at

265
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,720
least in the cases i've been involved in

266
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,000
it's you know maybe a few days to a week

267
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,160
is what we're seeing that's still plenty

268
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,519
of time

269
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,519
and your mileage may vary that's one of

270
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,680
the other challenges with ransomware is

271
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,360
everybody has a different view into

272
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,160
ransomware attacks and so what i see may

273
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,920
not be what you see may not be what

274
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,839
mandiant sees may not be what palo alto

275
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,560
sees etc but from what i'm seeing you

276
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,880
generally have a few days to a week

277
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,920
from initial access to uh

278
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,519
to when the ransomware is deployed um

279
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,800
so

280
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,680
and part of that is that distinction in

281
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,600
terms of activity from the initial

282
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,640
access broker to the actual ransomware

283
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,279
actor so generally there's two parts to

284
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,279
an attack the initial access broker gets

285
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,600
the access and they'll generally do that

286
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,279
you know we see this through phishing

287
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,399
campaigns uh credential reuse credential

288
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,079
stuffing attacks which are really really

289
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,440
big right now

290
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,000
straight up exploitation for

291
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
commonly exposed items and then of

292
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,240
course coming in through third parties

293
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,000
those are really the big things that we

294
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,920
see in terms of

295
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,079
uh in in terms of how that initial

296
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,279
access happens so that initial access is

297
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,440
that first part of that attack

298
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,200
um

299
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,920
and depending on how the initial access

300
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,600
broker works

301
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,079
you then have a few days to maybe a week

302
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,240
or two before the ransomware actor takes

303
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,120
over

304
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,920
so some initial access brokers work

305
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,839
directly for ransomware groups conti

306
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,160
famously

307
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,880
pioneered this activity where they

308
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,120
basically employ

309
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,160
employed contracted their initial access

310
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,720
brokers so that the initial access

311
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,079
brokers only worked for them

312
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,240
but a lot of other especially smaller

313
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,600
ransomware groups don't have their own

314
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,279
initial access brokers so they have to

315
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,640
buy on underground forms etc

316
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,079
we are seeing the number of ads for

317
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:36,959
for

318
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:41,040
networks for sale on open forums

319
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,839
slow down um and that's because most of

320
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,600
this activity are moving to private

321
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,640
telegram and talks channels um

322
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,639
just because uh

323
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,040
all of the initial access brokers know

324
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,040
that jackasses like me are watching for

325
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,200
all of these and trying to alert people

326
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,839
to let them know that hey your stuff's

327
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,279
for sale you should probably fix this

328
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,680
so so we are seeing more of this move to

329
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,279
private telegram channels and talks but

330
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,600
there's still an awful lot of initial

331
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,160
access broker activity which is really

332
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,639
interesting um

333
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,800
complete side note and aggression here

334
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,560
but just in case you're not scared

335
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,959
enough after coming to this event

336
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,200
i was talking to crain household who's

337
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,040
head of intelligence at abnormal

338
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,560
security at rsa and he's saying that he

339
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,240
was telling me that they're starting to

340
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,880
see business email compromise actors out

341
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,120
of africa reaching out to those same

342
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,519
initial access brokers to try and buy

343
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,000
that access because then they can send

344
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,920
their business email compromise emails

345
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,320
directly from the email server

346
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,760
which is going to be so much more

347
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,000
difficult to detect and uh find so

348
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,240
something to look out for going forward

349
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,079
that there may not just be ransomware

350
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,040
groups

351
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,880
uh using the initial access brokers we

352
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,320
may start seeing business email

353
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,040
compromise groups also using initial

354
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,480
access brokers um you know again in case

355
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,120
you wanted to didn't want to sleep ever

356
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,639
again

357
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,440
um so let's talk about threat hunting

358
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,200
unless anybody has any questions about

359
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,959
everything i've covered so far or thinks

360
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,000
i'm full of with anything i've said

361
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,839
no

362
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,720
okay

363
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,519
uh so this is basically what a modern

364
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,600
ransomware attack looks like

365
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,519
um as i already talked about initial

366
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,040
access generally phishing credential

367
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,800
stuffing credential reuse third party

368
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,279
third party is really big right now

369
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,760
we see so many ransomware groups uh or

370
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,839
initial access brokers that will get

371
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,680
that initial access

372
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,240
and they will um

373
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,600
they'll get that initial access and

374
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,680
they'll realize oh hey this this company

375
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,600
would be better to get access to their

376
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,120
customers than it would be to uh you

377
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,959
know than it would be to actually ransom

378
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,880
them so they use them to jump to a whole

379
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,279
bunch of other clients

380
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,639
exploitation uh recorded future tracked

381
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,959
52 different vulnerabilities used for

382
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,880
initial access by ransomware groups last

383
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,000
year almost none of which were zero day

384
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,160
they're common you know pretty much

385
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,000
well-known vulnerabilities with

386
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,160
proof-of-concept code so they're not

387
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,399
necessarily using zero days although

388
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,680
you'll hear about that because every

389
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,480
time they do use one it makes the news

390
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,079
most of them are just the everyday stuff

391
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,240
just people don't patch

392
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,680
things that are exposed to the internet

393
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,440
so please do that

394
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,360
insider threat is really interesting

395
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,040
because both lock bit lapses and yeah

396
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,440
both lock bit and lapses are very

397
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,760
interested in insider threat lock bit in

398
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,360
their note includes hey if you're

399
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,800
interested in

400
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,360
having us help us hack your company send

401
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,880
us an email and we'll give you some

402
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,560
money to do that

403
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,560
the good news is right now they suck at

404
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,440
it we haven't seen any

405
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,000
successful confirmed case of insider

406
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,440
threat we've seen some rumors that there

407
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,279
may have been some but nothing that's

408
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,880
been publicly reported in the one

409
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,959
publicly reported case was tesla last

410
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,120
year where you know the russian that

411
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,639
tried to do it got detained at the

412
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,760
airport and the fbi got involved

413
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,279
but the fact that they're very

414
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,360
interested in it means that this will

415
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,199
probably be more of a threat going

416
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,440
forward ransomware actors tend to suck

417
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,800
at things when they first start doing

418
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,399
them and then they get a lot better at

419
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,720
them because they do it a lot

420
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,519
uh so from there you'll see cobalt

421
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,480
strike we see some more sliver now or ps

422
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,639
exec as they move through the network

423
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,040
that's all the tools they use ransomware

424
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,240
actors don't like the command line

425
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,160
some of them do for the most part they

426
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,160
don't so we see a whole lot of remote

427
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,839
control through rdp teamviewer any desk

428
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,600
you know all of those down at the bottom

429
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,759
and then you know they'll get access to

430
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,839
all the servers they need they'll steal

431
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,839
all the files

432
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,720
they love mega dot io mega dot i i o in

433
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,800
any of its sub domains that's where they

434
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,480
love to send all of their data because

435
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,079
then they don't have to build additional

436
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,519
command and control infrastructure they

437
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,279
can just send it all up to there and

438
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,040
they can pay for their mega dot io

439
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,160
accounts

440
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,320
uh with bitcoin

441
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,800
uh then they'll run a couple of tests so

442
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,560
test a couple of boxes make sure that

443
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,519
the encryption works um and then they'll

444
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,040
you know encrypt your whole network as

445
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,519
much as they can um try and delete logs

446
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,800
and clean up

447
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,240
uh and then you'll have the extortion

448
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,800
site which can happen days later or

449
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,639
months later depending on the ransomware

450
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,040
group or it might never happen and just

451
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,880
because

452
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,440
some just because a victim never appears

453
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,720
on an extortion site does not

454
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,120
necessarily mean they paid most of these

455
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,120
guys english isn't their first or second

456
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,680
or third language and so they have a

457
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,759
list of keywords they look for

458
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,079
and i've seen a number of times where

459
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,639
they just pulled out crap data so they

460
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,160
don't even bother to throw it up on the

461
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,120
extortion site you know we had one we

462
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,199
had one client that i was helping that

463
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,759
they pulled up a bunch of old

464
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,920
old log data from systems that hadn't

465
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,359
been used since like uh

466
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:06,880
2005 and i asked them why they even kept

467
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,559
the logs but it turned out it was a

468
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,559
great honeypot because the ransomware

469
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,000
actor stole all that data and they

470
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,720
didn't care um so they had a good laugh

471
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,000
it's not very often you get to have a

472
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,880
good laugh when you're in the

473
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,640
negotiation chat with the ransomware

474
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,559
actors but they did have a good laugh

475
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,799
about that

476
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,199
um so when we talk about threat hunting

477
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,280
what are we talking about

478
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,960
we're talking about taking intelligence

479
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,960
that you get from some place so whether

480
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,039
it's a talk like this if you follow

481
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,880
florian roth on twitter and if you're on

482
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,240
twitter you should definitely follow

483
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,320
florian roth because his sigma roles are

484
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,879
amazing

485
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,039
but you know if you follow the dfir

486
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,720
report website they have incredible

487
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,559
intelligence that they deliver from

488
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,799
their attacks there are all kinds of

489
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,160
great places where you can get your

490
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,160
threat intelligence you can also buy a

491
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,520
subscription to record a future where

492
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,880
you have to have a booth right outside

493
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,720
the door but i'm not here to plug

494
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,080
recorded future you get your

495
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,360
intelligence from wherever you get it

496
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,720
from

497
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,000
you want to build your threat hunting

498
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,760
packages that look for the expected

499
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,039
badness

500
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,320
and

501
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,240
figure that the intelligence that you're

502
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,080
getting is not necessarily going to work

503
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,400
exactly for your network

504
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,520
so you're probably going to have to

505
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,720
refine your searches because you're

506
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,320
going to get some false positives you're

507
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,760
going to get some

508
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,200
um

509
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,160
you know there are going to be some

510
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,760
mistakes they're going to be some you

511
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,640
know

512
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,799
differences in the way every network's a

513
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:25,919
little bit different so there'll be some

514
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,160
vagaries in i got this state this

515
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,240
intelligence but my network doesn't

516
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,000
quite respond to this

517
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,200
and so

518
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,760
um we're going to uh

519
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,679
uh you know we're going to make changes

520
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,440
and then always provide feedback that

521
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,760
feedback loop is so important to

522
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,440
wherever you're getting your data from

523
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,600
hey you know you did this i just want

524
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,120
you to know that in our network because

525
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,280
we have this this didn't work and that

526
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,200
allows it to improve so that the next

527
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,960
person that gets that

528
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,480
that pulls that intelligence down will

529
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,120
have a more refined and better solution

530
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,880
this is especially true with like yara

531
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,520
and sigma rules

532
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,039
so again

533
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,360
good thread hunting only works

534
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,120
when you have good network hygiene in

535
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,280
place if you don't know what assets you

536
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,240
have it's really hard to hunt for them

537
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,840
and asset management's one of those

538
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,640
things

539
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,400
i'm old

540
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,080
i've been doing this for a really long

541
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,679
time and i've been talking about the

542
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,160
need for good asset management basically

543
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,200
since i've been in infosec

544
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,280
and we're still talking about it so it

545
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,640
still isn't to solve problem

546
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,320
unfortunately despite all the companies

547
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,600
that will tell you that they've solved

548
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,080
the problem

549
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,960
and so but you need to have good asset

550
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,320
management because if you're only threat

551
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,520
hunting part of the network you're

552
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,240
missing a lot of stuff

553
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,679
and

554
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,760
and it's always hard to tell people this

555
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,240
because asset management and you know

556
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,080
good vulnerability management isn't sexy

557
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,280
nobody's going to invite you to give a

558
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,520
talk at rsa or black hat because you've

559
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,400
managed to uh do good asset management

560
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,080
even though i feel like they should

561
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,440
because that is actually pretty

562
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,720
impressive um but you know you know

563
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,640
whereas like when i get to come up and

564
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,760
talk about threat hunting everybody's

565
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,080
like oh threat hunting is sexy i mean as

566
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,600
sexy as something an infosec can be um

567
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,039
especially when delivered by an old

568
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,520
white guy like me um

569
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,640
but

570
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,559
um

571
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,679
you know um but but without the basics

572
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,480
the the cool fun stuff doesn't work and

573
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,919
it's just going to actually make you

574
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,360
less secure

575
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,480
um and so what you want to understand is

576
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,960
how the how ransomware attacks work the

577
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,880
kind of tools that ransomware actors are

578
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,280
using and especially as those tools

579
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,159
change and then what detections work so

580
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,080
this is an example and and i like to

581
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,720
think of this you know kind of like a a

582
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,159
threat hunting is kind of like a boxing

583
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,799
match right you don't necessarily have

584
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:51,679
to

585
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,240
get a knockout in the first round it's

586
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,919
you know if you go to the second or

587
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,760
third round all those different stages

588
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,520
that we talked about before

589
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,320
if you go to the second or third round

590
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,880
as long as you get the tko in the end

591
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,960
that's what matters so wherever you

592
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,200
happen to detect them depending on your

593
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,960
capability and depending on what you

594
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,400
have in

595
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,039
uh you know in your network and and

596
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,400
that's the other thing i like to tell

597
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,640
people

598
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,640
one of the things i think we've done as

599
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,120
an industry that's kind of a disservice

600
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,360
is every time we are trying to solve a

601
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,600
problem we solve the problem by selling

602
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,039
you a box or an agent right um you know

603
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,039
so you know and this has been going on

604
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,200
for 30 years right oh hey people are

605
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,400
getting into your network here's the

606
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,000
firewall firewalls don't detect

607
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,159
everything well great here's an ids well

608
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,720
ids's don't detect everything well here

609
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,640
here's some endpoints protection well

610
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,080
that's not detecting everything well

611
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,000
here's a web application firewall here's

612
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,240
a proxy and then you wind up with 30

613
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,320
different things in your security tech

614
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,480
stack none of which talk to each other

615
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,400
so here now you have a sim that you can

616
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,559
send all the logs too oh but they don't

617
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,200
correlate very well things get missed

618
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,640
so

619
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,320
when you're doing your threat hunting i

620
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,159
always recommend people take the tools

621
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,400
that you have already and start

622
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,159
repurposing those for threat hunting

623
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,159
don't go buy new tools if you can't do

624
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:13,360
everything we're talking about here

625
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,280
today so like if you don't have edr so

626
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,600
you don't have a way to shove your rules

627
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,840
or sigma rules look at some of the other

628
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,600
things that that we're going to talk

629
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,840
about you want to start with the basics

630
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,919
get really good with those and then move

631
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,919
forward to the other things

632
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,679
so that being said

633
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,159
this is a great yara rule from dfir

634
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,600
report

635
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,960
on

636
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,200
detecting quackbot a lot of ransomware

637
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,280
actors have moved especially with

638
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,360
trickbot being all weird

639
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,960
have moved to ice id and moved to

640
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,720
quackbot for that initial delivery

641
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,120
mechanism through their phishing emails

642
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,159
um so you know so being able to detect

643
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,880
that initial entry is really important

644
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,440
you can stop the attack before they get

645
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,120
started

646
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,880
same thing with stock ghoulish so stock

647
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,640
ghoulers also delivered as part of

648
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,919
phishing attacks

649
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,480
generally you're downloading a

650
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,559
javascript compressed file but this is

651
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,840
another yara rule for detecting um for

652
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,480
detecting stock ghoulish

653
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,720
this looks for the specific

654
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,720
javascript hashes that were used

655
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,280
and uh

656
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,400
yeah so this looks for the specific uh

657
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,960
uh java uh uh hashes that were

658
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,720
associated with this and this was wasted

659
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,240
locker delivering

660
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,360
um the uh delivering javascript through

661
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,679
stock ghoulish early on there are other

662
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,320
really good yara rules sigma rules for

663
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,120
detecting stock ghoulish as well

664
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,520
power shell

665
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,880
we're going to be a little interactive

666
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,720
here for a second so hopefully you all

667
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,919
don't mind raising your hands

668
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:56,480
too many organizations i walk into don't

669
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,640
don't have powershell logging turned on

670
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,720
please do that doesn't cost you anything

671
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,559
i mean i know it costs you because

672
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,240
splunk charges an arm and a leg for

673
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,320
every you know extra line of log that

674
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,159
you collect but

675
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:09,440
um

676
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,200
remember when splunk was like the cool

677
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,559
vendor that gave out t-shirts at

678
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,720
conferences and now they're like

679
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,960
yo oh wow i can't afford my splunk bill

680
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,880
anymore please no offense to anybody

681
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,240
from splunk that works here you still

682
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,240
make a great product you're just super

683
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,240
expensive

684
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,679
but

685
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,440
ransomware groups rely heavily on

686
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,120
powershell scripts

687
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,000
so

688
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,919
if you can turn on powershell logging

689
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,600
and collect those powershell logging

690
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,080
it's a great threat hunting tool some of

691
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,559
the simple things um if any of you ever

692
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,720
take chris sanders uh

693
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,480
powershell hunting course which i highly

694
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,559
recommend or a threat hunting course

695
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,320
which i highly recommend he does a great

696
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,400
section on powershell but one of the

697
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,400
simple things to do is and again this

698
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,320
involves knowing your network

699
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,080
um

700
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,240
uh you know this this involves knowing

701
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,600
your network know what powershell

702
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,120
scripts are supposed to be running in

703
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,799
your network start with that okay these

704
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,400
are the knowns this is what's supposed

705
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,960
to be there and then look for powershell

706
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,080
scripts that

707
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,360
aren't supposed to be running in your

708
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,039
network that are only running on one or

709
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,440
two machines so that's a simple threat

710
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,480
hunting thing that is only required

711
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,480
your only required knowledge is what is

712
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,799
supposed to happen your network

713
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:19,919
look for anything that's either

714
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,320
disabling or creating new admin accounts

715
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,240
ransomware actors love to make new admin

716
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,159
accounts

717
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,799
look for um again look for new scripts

718
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,799
look for scripts running at odd times

719
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,960
ransomware actors love to work friday

720
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,240
evening and saturday evening because

721
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,120
they know the socks are are less staffed

722
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,200
and then what else so

723
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,480
for those of you that are doing

724
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,039
powershell logging and threat hunting

725
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,799
what else do you look for as part of

726
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,720
this yes sir

727
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,120
i'm sorry

728
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,919
yep

729
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,240
that's very good anything else

730
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,600
network connections that's another

731
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,000
really good one yes so anybody else

732
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,480
okay at least we got two i'm happy that

733
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,080
we've got some level of participation

734
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,200
here it means i'm not putting you all to

735
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,520
sleep right after lunch um

736
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,840
but you know really think about the ways

737
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,240
that you can use powershell logging and

738
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,000
what you know about your network to find

739
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,559
other things i will say one other thing

740
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:19,440
that

741
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,679
a lot of people don't catch and this

742
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,640
even isn't with powershell the first

743
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,080
thing that a lot of ransomware actors do

744
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,840
when they get in is they shut down your

745
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,760
security toll so they shut down your

746
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,080
antivirus they shut down your edr or

747
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,559
whatever most organizations don't set

748
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,799
that as a high alert so if another

749
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,799
process is shutting down your security

750
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:42,320
process so not part of closing the

751
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,919
normal part of you know shutting down

752
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,000
the computer but another process

753
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,679
shutting it off that should be a high

754
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,760
alert because generally the only people

755
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,080
who are doing that are bad guys and

756
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,520
employees that are trying to do bad

757
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,320
things so um

758
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,320
and and you know i know some analysts

759
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,080
will tell me no no no i have to do it

760
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,440
because i have to

761
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,520
um you know because i have to do malware

762
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,960
analysis or whatever you should have a

763
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,240
separate machine for doing that you

764
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,600
shouldn't be doing it on your work

765
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,320
machine connected to the work network um

766
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,880
so be looking for

767
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,840
a

768
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,799
av av system shutting down or security

769
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:17,760
uh

770
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,720
shell shutting down

771
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,440
again we mentioned the guise earlier if

772
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,440
you're not using these guise in your

773
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,960
network if you're not using screen

774
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,200
connect any desk splashtop or other

775
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,480
remote gui topics get those file hashes

776
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,000
look for those so you can feed those

777
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,200
into your edr and you can be looking for

778
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,200
that because all the ransomware actors

779
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,960
do is they download the executable from

780
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,320
wherever they keep their tools and then

781
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,240
they execute it back to wherever they

782
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,159
are in russia and

783
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,640
and keep working so look for those tools

784
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,240
and that should be a high alert because

785
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,000
again if you have an employee that's

786
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,120
using one of these guise they're

787
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,399
probably not doing anything you want

788
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,000
them to do anyway they may not be doing

789
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,640
something bad but they may not be doing

790
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,360
something that you want

791
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,880
uh cobalt strike cobalt strike cobalt

792
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,760
strike

793
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,120
um

794
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,760
we use we see so much cobalt strike from

795
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,360
the ransomware groups we're starting to

796
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,120
see a little more sliver

797
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,880
than um than we are uh uh than we used

798
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,919
to so sliver is another one and i'm

799
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,840
gonna put together a couple of slides on

800
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,640
that

801
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,520
um

802
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,440
and you know there was just a report

803
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,840
that some ransomware groups are using um

804
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,039
brute retell as well the creator of

805
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,880
brute retell denies that um so but it

806
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,559
still can't hurt because that the worst

807
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:39,200
that happens is if you find any brute

808
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,039
retell in your network the worst that

809
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,559
happens is you catch a red team doing

810
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,600
red team things and congratulations so

811
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,880
um so look for any of these tools that

812
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,840
are being used by uh

813
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,679
that are being used by these ransomware

814
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,159
groups these red teaming tools that that

815
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,399
the ransomware groups like to use

816
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,360
um so this is an example of

817
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,399
uh

818
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:05,360
of looking for cobalt strike loader

819
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,440
um but then this is a great one from

820
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,320
kyle kuchi i love this because this you

821
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,559
don't have to have any kind of yara

822
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,240
sigma capability

823
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,559
this looks for

824
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,679
this looks for the name d pipes so by

825
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,440
default and

826
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,600
interestingly most ransomware groups

827
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,960
keep the default settings in their

828
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,880
cobalt strike because they don't

829
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,720
necessarily know how to use it well they

830
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,799
just know how to use it and the tool

831
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:33,520
itself works really well

832
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,440
but looking for these default pipes that

833
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,799
are formatted as msse dash four digits

834
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,399
dash server

835
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:43,279
look for event id pipe created and 18

836
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,440
pipe connected for these alerts you do

837
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,399
have to turn on sysmon in order

838
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:50,640
in order to to catch this level of

839
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,600
logging and again i know making you have

840
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,600
more logs and collect more logs is easy

841
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,159
for me to say but hard on your budget it

842
00:29:58,159 --> 00:29:59,840
is worth it and the type of data that

843
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,919
you can collect with sysmon and using

844
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,960
the system journals tools can be very

845
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,399
beneficial

846
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,159
ad find is another one that ransomware

847
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,080
actors really like we see a lot of ad

848
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,720
find and bloodhound so again going back

849
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,120
to the other slide where we walk through

850
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,120
any of those tools basically you want to

851
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,120
look for them and you want to look for

852
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,279
them in all of the different various

853
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,480
forms uh whether it's leo i mean uh

854
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,480
uh you know some of these you can inject

855
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,240
into memory some of these you just

856
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,840
operate as an executable on the ground

857
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,600
etc some of them have been converted to

858
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,640
scripts

859
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,480
to script formats so whatever those

860
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,159
forms are

861
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,080
you want to look for those but add find

862
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,320
is one that goes unnoticed by a lot but

863
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,000
i do see it in a lot of ransomware

864
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,360
attacks

865
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,200
then data transfer

866
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,159
if you are not using mega dot io for

867
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,399
anything legitimate just block it and

868
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:54,080
all of its domains

869
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,799
um the ransomware actors love mega dot

870
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,519
io again because they can pay in bitcoin

871
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,840
it's cheap and they can upload unlimited

872
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,960
amounts of data from your network

873
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,399
and so any of the mega dot i o mega dot

874
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,720
nz and there's like 10 other domains

875
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,799
that are associated with them find all

876
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,399
those domains and just block them that's

877
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,480
an easy thing

878
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,000
understand ransomware actors will figure

879
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,360
out a way around that they can set up

880
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,799
their own command control server and

881
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,480
exfil the data that way

882
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,399
but at least you've made it a little

883
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,440
more difficult for them um and most of

884
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,120
the organizations that i talk to and

885
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,200
that i've worked with don't actually use

886
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,440
mega dot io for internal file transfers

887
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,640
even though they do have business

888
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,120
accounts most of them are using um you

889
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,679
know some you know using other services

890
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:42,159
but along with that look for the tools

891
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:43,840
that the ransomware actors like to use

892
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,880
to compress and and exfil the data

893
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,519
rclone 7-zip mega sync and other file

894
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,840
transfer tools like that there's quite a

895
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,760
list of them that the ransomware actors

896
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,559
use

897
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,039
um so look for those and again look for

898
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,640
those on your network get the file

899
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,840
hashes because they're using the

900
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,840
legitimate versions of these tools so

901
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,320
the file hashes are publicly available

902
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,159
and they don't change very often which

903
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:07,919
is nice

904
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,159
and again that only works if you know

905
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:11,840
the tools aren't being used by your

906
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,760
internal admin staff obviously you don't

907
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,880
want to

908
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,840
um you know falsely flag anything in

909
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,880
your uh that your it staff or your

910
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,519
security staff may be using

911
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,760
shadow copy deletion i almost hate to

912
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,039
include this

913
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:30,399
because this is kind of like

914
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:32,000
you know this is kind of like your last

915
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,159
ditch effort but you know i'll throw it

916
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,480
out there just because you have it

917
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,240
um

918
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,200
every ransomware group that i know of

919
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,120
delete shadow copies right before they

920
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,120
start the encryption process

921
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,240
so deleting shadow copies is absolutely

922
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,200
a sign

923
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,640
that you are about to be hit with

924
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,799
ransomware the problem is

925
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,240
that it's a sign you're being hit with

926
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,880
ransomware now so for most organizations

927
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,799
if you have an alert like this set up

928
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,240
it's going to travel through the logs

929
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,760
it's going to go through yours it's

930
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,440
going to go to your sim it's going to

931
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,840
bubble through the sim process 15

932
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,519
minutes later you you know if you're

933
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,200
lucky 15 minutes later you're going to

934
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,799
get an alert that says hey

935
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,399
shadow copies have been deleted on the

936
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,000
server by then it's too late they're

937
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,440
already halfway through encrypting the

938
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,159
machine and probably other machines as

939
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,720
well so i hate to include this as a

940
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,480
threat hunting detection

941
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,840
but

942
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,559
if you can maybe stop you know to limit

943
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,480
the damage especially if you have good

944
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,880
network segmentation which

945
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,480
most networks i walk into don't

946
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,399
unfortunately but if you have good

947
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,080
network segmentation this does help

948
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,240
limit the damage there are some tools

949
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,559
out there again florian roth makes one

950
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,480
that will automatically delete any

951
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,159
process that tries to delete shadow

952
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,159
copies um

953
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:51,039
and and there are ways to configure your

954
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:53,120
edr if you're using edr that hey if

955
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,720
something deletes shadow copies kill

956
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,279
that process and send the alert and then

957
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:58,799
isolate the machine from the rest of the

958
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,200
network so you can automate that and if

959
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,960
you have those automation capabilities i

960
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,880
highly recommend taking advantage of

961
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,679
that and that's all i have i know we're

962
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,119
a little bit early

963
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,520
so i'm happy to take any questions

964
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,719
um if anybody has any but otherwise i

965
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,239
really really appreciate everybody's

966
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,480
time and attention especially right

967
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,320
after lunch so i appreciate everybody

968
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,480
who managed to stay awake with a full

969
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,399
stomach

970
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,799
thank you

971
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,879
no questions

972
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,839
awesome

973
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,119
yeah

974
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,239
yeah no

975
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,320
that's a that's a really good question

976
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,560
um

977
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,879
i like to have a conversation so i'm

978
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,879
part of the the csr team at recorded

979
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,879
future and we we have to do this all the

980
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,640
time where i like to have this

981
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,800
conversation with hey this is a known

982
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,880
bad tool but i know that our developers

983
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,040
also use it so

984
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,920
i mean generally what i do is we we have

985
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,440
these are the developer machines and

986
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,960
these machines are authorized to have

987
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,640
7-zip installed

988
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,960
everything else isn't it's not a perfect

989
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,160
solution but that way i know if our edr

990
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,760
catches anything

991
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,320
outside of the developer solution

992
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,520
then um you know then you know outside

993
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,760
the developer network then that we

994
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,160
should investigate and you know and what

995
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,720
i count on is we implement

996
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,880
a bunch of these protections

997
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,119
uh so that if we miss 7-zip we've

998
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:39,440
hopefully caught something else

999
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,880
but that's a really good question and

1000
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,440
it's definitely a problem

1001
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,720
yes

1002
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,280
i'm sorry hold on i want everybody to

1003
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,640
hear that because i think that was a

1004
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,359
really good point

1005
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,760
