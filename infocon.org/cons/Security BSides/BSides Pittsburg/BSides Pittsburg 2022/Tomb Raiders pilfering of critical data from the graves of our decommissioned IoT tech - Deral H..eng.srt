1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,599
thanks a lot today for coming from my

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:04,160
presentation uh tomb raiders

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,920
the pilfering of critical data from the

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,000
graves of decommissioned iot technology

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,280
so we're going to take this a little

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,719
farther and we're not going to get into

7
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,839
this crazy what's the definition of iot

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,359
so i want you to look at this this is

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,560
going to apply to embedded technology

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,640
for the most part so embedded technology

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,359
that are used by consumers used by

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,400
medical

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,320
industrial

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,439
transportation whatever the case may be

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,920
we're dealing with embedded technology

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,920
technology that typically doesn't have a

17
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,160
monitor on it or a keyboard those type

18
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,200
of things

19
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,040
and the potential risk and threats

20
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,040
around that

21
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,719
so a little more information about me

22
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,559
i'm daryl hyland i work at rapid7 i i

23
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,320
have listed up here as a principal

24
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,480
security researcher for iot i'm actually

25
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,600
the manager

26
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,399
of the research team for ot and iot but

27
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,039
it's a very technical road i do much as

28
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,559
much research

29
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,640
as the guys that actually work with me

30
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,080
or work for me

31
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,520
i've been in information technology for

32
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,520
30 years i've been in the

33
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,680
information security field for 20 years

34
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,840
in the last five years has been

35
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,200
100 focused on research

36
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,159
on iot ot and embedded based technology

37
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,600
so we're going to talk about a lot of

38
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,159
this is going to dive into you know what

39
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,400
do we need to do with this tech

40
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,880
because as the screen says

41
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,159
you're not going to have to eventually

42
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,079
de-acquisition sooner or later it's

43
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,600
going to die

44
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,360
or it's going to be replaced with newer

45
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,799
technology

46
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,200
and historically we've been

47
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,920
kind of trained eventually that when we

48
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,119
deal with desktops laptop servers we

49
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,799
finally got to the point where we don't

50
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,439
sell our hard drives on ebay anymore we

51
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,759
know from all the news stories and stuff

52
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,079
out there that we don't do that the

53
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,719
problem is is embedded technology can

54
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,680
store

55
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,520
quite a bit of data some of these

56
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,640
embedded devices have multi-gig storage

57
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,040
on them that can contain an infinite

58
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,878
number of data and some of the critical

59
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,479
data we're specifically going to talk

60
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,480
about today

61
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,840
so we start thinking about the

62
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,520
acquisition of the things what

63
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,360
technology in your environment or in

64
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,000
your home would fall into this category

65
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,480
i think of a network appliances medical

66
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,840
device technology industrial devices

67
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,840
i also consider printers in this

68
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,200
category smart tvs

69
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,280
smart lighting and this is just a small

70
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,920
list that goes on and on and on in this

71
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,239
new automated world we live in

72
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,360
all of this technology is in our homes

73
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,440
in our hospitals

74
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,599
in our plants in our manufacturing

75
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,080
environments our business environments

76
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,519
and we have to get rid of it sooner or

77
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:50,480
later

78
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,239
and we need to start thinking about that

79
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,800
now because what i found out there is

80
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,040
we're obviously not thinking about that

81
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,920
and we'll talk about those specifically

82
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,680
so then we get into well we have to

83
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,519
de-acquisition how do we do it there's

84
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,840
so many different ways of doing this

85
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,680
do we resell it

86
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,440
that's a viable option sometimes

87
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,200
companies want to retain some of the

88
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,599
capital expenditures that go into some

89
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,760
of this technology at home consumers do

90
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,120
the same thing

91
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,120
they have devices they're done with it

92
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,120
hey let's sell it on ebay

93
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,959
i may only get 10 cents on the dollar

94
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,720
from what i paid for but that's better

95
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,319
than nothing

96
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,239
disposal services there's a number of

97
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,920
those out there and as more and more

98
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,480
states spin up required laws of

99
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,200
disposing of electronic trash

100
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,959
properly instead of just throwing in a

101
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,680
dump somewhere you get disposal services

102
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,680
that are available and i think those are

103
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,920
important something critical to think

104
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,840
about

105
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,360
recycling recycling takes a number of

106
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,200
different things hey can we feed it

107
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,599
through a grinder which i like that idea

108
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,840
and recycle it for the metal the plastic

109
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,400
the gold the silver whatever is in it

110
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,879
that's pretty good we can donate it as

111
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,799
another option that's kind of like the

112
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,400
whole recycling thing i've seen

113
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,959
companies give their stuff away to

114
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,319
recycle it for other companies to reuse

115
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,879
or other organizations or non-profits to

116
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,000
reuse

117
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,760
we also have to deal with the whole idea

118
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,519
of leased equipment

119
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,120
so you go out there and you lease all

120
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,959
this equipment as example all your

121
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,358
printers or whatever the tech may you

122
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,520
lease this technology it comes into your

123
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,639
environment

124
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,880
after so many impressions on the printer

125
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,360
it goes back out the door

126
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,120
have you ever thought about what's going

127
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,880
back out the door

128
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,800
so the picture in the middle there

129
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,400
that actually shows all the printers i

130
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,880
couldn't find the one i originally took

131
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,240
so a number of years i did a lot of

132
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,919
research on multi-function printer

133
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,240
attacks for pin testers wrote a bunch of

134
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,080
tools did a bunch of presentations and

135
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,440
stuff like that

136
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,440
and i was working on

137
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,960
an exploit that i had developed on a

138
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,800
xerox multi-function printers where you

139
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,960
could actually gain root level access to

140
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,560
these things by sending a print job to

141
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,759
them

142
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,440
and i needed to develop a metasploit

143
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,120
module so it's kind of hard to really do

144
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,800
that when you're trying to hack away at

145
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,320
a printer to set in your office people

146
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,479
don't like that crap so i would up the

147
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,320
buy one and you can go up to these

148
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,840
places that recycle these things and

149
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,840
resell them and you can pick them up

150
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,479
fairly cheap i think i paid 500 for a

151
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,199
printer three years before sold for 12

152
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,360
000

153
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,360
the warehouse i went into

154
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,199
i could have swore

155
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,039
the freaking printers which so far you

156
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,560
could see them disappear on the over the

157
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,120
horizon this building was that big was

158
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,520
in columbus ohio and i got into the

159
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,680
conversation with them about various

160
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,600
attacks on these devices and harvesting

161
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,039
data off and the guys were kind of

162
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,440
interested so i was testing the devices

163
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,880
to see if they're the right versions and

164
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,919
vulnerable

165
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,000
and i showed this thing to him he's like

166
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,320
wow you just pull data off that thing

167
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,680
that's not supposed to be on that

168
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,400
printer everything that comes back to me

169
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,280
uncon contractual agreement

170
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,360
from the resellers that are disposing of

171
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,520
it that those are supposed to be wiped

172
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,440
so we did a random check

173
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,520
we just picked 12 printers went around

174
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,840
and i checked every one of them over a

175
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,680
half of them i was actually able to pull

176
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,400
active directory creds off the device i

177
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,199
was able to identify where it came from

178
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,440
and the active directory credentials on

179
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,919
that particular device so then i asked

180
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,440
them the question

181
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,000
do you wipe these things he's like no we

182
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,680
pack them and we ship them

183
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,440
i said where do you ship them

184
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,560
we ship them to asia

185
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,000
so really really let that sink in

186
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,039
so if we take this warehouse that had 10

187
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,800
000 printers in it

188
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,080
and let's say only 10 of them

189
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,639
still had creds on it and print jobs and

190
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,120
data and critical information

191
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,520
that's a thousand machines from who

192
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,599
knows how many different companies of

193
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,280
critical data that could be used to

194
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,599
compromise those organizations

195
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,759
being shipped to asia

196
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,919
so then it makes me start wondering why

197
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,400
does asia one of these old printers that

198
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,960
are basically wore out things have like

199
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,639
a million impressions in them half of

200
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,000
them don't even work right

201
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,840
i don't know

202
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,639
but it makes you think about that

203
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,400
so moving on what is the risk well we've

204
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,919
talked about one dealing with the

205
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,240
printers but lots of critical data i

206
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,759
have a couple news stories i thought

207
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,080
this one was oh so freaking fascinating

208
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,759
so this was two years ago i think two

209
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,199
years what was it

210
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,479
uh 20 uh 2020 two years ago news article

211
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,880
came out and it deal with police body

212
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,160
cams

213
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,840
so one of the cities i don't remember

214
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,080
where it was decided they needed upgrade

215
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,599
their police body cams they gathered

216
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,520
them all up bought new ones sold them

217
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,039
all on ebay

218
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,039
every one of them still had police

219
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,840
footage on it they'd never been wiped

220
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,680
this was data of police you know

221
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,160
everything from arresting people to

222
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,520
showing up to

223
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,199
homes where people were fighting and

224
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,280
trying to solve that but it was

225
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,400
probably thousands of hours of footage

226
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,080
private footage in my opinion that

227
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,000
probably shouldn't be out there being

228
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,319
sold on ebay for the highest bidder and

229
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,400
it was pretty cheap

230
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,919
was a good example

231
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,039
another one this was a great article

232
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,360
think about selling an echo dot and this

233
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,879
this goes home to the individual

234
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,240
consumers

235
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,319
and this was done by uh one of the user

236
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,759
universities on

237
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,400
phd team i think it was western i don't

238
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,759
have that information in my head right

239
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,440
now i apologize

240
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,039
but they did a bunch of tests and they

241
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,080
did this on echo ones echo twos various

242
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,559
versions of those the interesting thing

243
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,039
i had done this exact same test but i'd

244
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,479
only done it on

245
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,200
version two of the echo i think it was

246
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,440
they did it on all three of them it was

247
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,839
is data still on these devices

248
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,519
and it was a large percentage of these

249
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,399
devices that they got still had consumer

250
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,880
data on it which is basically amazon

251
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,800
passwords

252
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,040
so you you buy these and you can

253
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,920
actually

254
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,160
pull people's amazon passwords off and

255
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,920
if you know anything about that you can

256
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,240
often make purchases on that data which

257
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,720
is pretty critical the cool thing about

258
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,320
this when you start dealing with the

259
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,000
embedded multimedia controllers that

260
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
exist on these devices

261
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,920
they have a thing called level wearing

262
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,240
level wearing is every time something is

263
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,080
changed or altered on that device it

264
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,000
doesn't overwrite the same location with

265
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,040
the same data or modified data it writes

266
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,680
it to another location on the chips uh

267
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,880
silicon

268
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,959
another place and then wipes that out

269
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,600
and that is to maintain the chip to last

270
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,839
for a long period of time keep writing

271
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,440
in the same place you start having

272
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,120
failures in the device

273
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,000
and level wearing solves that problem

274
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,080
so one of the tests they ran

275
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,000
and then i think it was only on device

276
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,279
level three

277
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,600
like when you flush one of these devices

278
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,600
you do a factory reset which you should

279
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,160
do that means you keep it online you go

280
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,000
on the amazon

281
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,560
and you decommission the device

282
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,279
it will wipe the device so when it wipes

283
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,000
the device it's not immediately

284
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,399
it basically tags it and then waits for

285
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,040
a watchdog process to kick in

286
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,959
to wipe that data

287
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,040
version one and two of the device and i

288
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,720
even tested this prior to this paper

289
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,200
coming out successfully wipe that that

290
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,880
means if you do a factory reset through

291
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,440
the amazon application it removes the

292
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,160
data but apparently device number three

293
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,720
the latency between

294
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,720
the what you overriding it and the

295
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,640
watchdog kicking off to actually carry

296
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,959
this out was long enough that if you do

297
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,200
the clear on the amazon and walk over

298
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,399
and unplug it

299
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,120
it will not wipe your data

300
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,279
so and the reason why i tell you that is

301
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,959
you have these devices and you do a

302
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,480
factory reset

303
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,399
leave it online for a little time i

304
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,320
don't know what that time is

305
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,320
but leave it online for 30 more minutes

306
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,000
before you unplug it and then the data

307
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,440
will probably be cleaned up by the

308
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,519
watchdog process when it does its level

309
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,040
wearing on the device

310
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,399
so it's something to think about as

311
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,920
consumers when you get ready to get rid

312
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,000
of any device kind of think about that

313
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,120
you do a factory reset

314
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,200
give it a little bit of time let things

315
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,000
process don't go factory reset and then

316
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,600
pull the plug immediately

317
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,440
give a chance for the internal operating

318
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,040
systems to hopefully clear off the data

319
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,920
and i've tested a lot of devices

320
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,959
as iot research for factory resets to

321
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,760
see does that work and most of them do

322
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,760
it's a rare occasion you'll have one

323
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,519
that will not delete the data it just

324
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,120
tells you it's deleted but for the most

325
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,320
part it's always deleted

326
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,040
this here another example

327
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,519
i do a lot of work with the iot village

328
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,000
of defcon i run hands-on exercises out

329
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,120
there which we're going to be doing

330
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,200
again this year where you get actually

331
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,959
hack on a piece of hardware and pull

332
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,800
critical data out or interact with the

333
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,519
operating system uh to modify things and

334
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,760
get root level access on it so these

335
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,839
were devices i bought these luma which

336
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,079
are mesh wi-fi devices

337
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,920
i think i bought like 20 of these they

338
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,600
come in kits to three ebay i'm just

339
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,120
buying them left and right because i

340
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,279
needed all these for the lab

341
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,880
so when i got them home i started

342
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,320
looking at them

343
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,639
i found out over half of them had never

344
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,040
been factory reset

345
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,760
so for a consumer the threat is fairly

346
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,399
minimal it's there but it's minimal but

347
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,720
it turned out that a number of these

348
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,800
were not used by consumers they were

349
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,040
used by small businesses

350
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,200
so i was able to get the business names

351
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,760
the accounts the wi-fi pre-shared keys

352
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,920
all that critical information

353
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,680
and if you know anything about anyone

354
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,040
who decides they're going to change a

355
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,560
wi-fi access point out in your

356
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,240
organization

357
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,720
you don't always change the passwords

358
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,320
pre-share keys and all that stuff

359
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,959
usually use the same ssids

360
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,120
the same pre-shared keys that way you

361
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,279
know if you have 100 users on your

362
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,800
network you don't have to screw a change

363
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,720
in all the workstations

364
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,800
as a prime example

365
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,200
so again another example of data just

366
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,800
being out there

367
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,959
and it kind of goes on and on so

368
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,399
when you think about pulling the data

369
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,000
off there's a number of ways to get data

370
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,920
off these devices

371
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,839
if i'm just after the data on the

372
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,360
devices i'm not going to worry about

373
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,760
things like jtag and all this fancy

374
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,639
stuff

375
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,240
i'm going to throw the damn thing in a

376
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,160
reflow oven and just rip the chip off

377
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,920
and drop it into a reader pull all the

378
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,399
information i can do that in a fraction

379
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,800
of the time of getting that stuff off

380
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,639
and here's some example of devices

381
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:21,920
pulling chips

382
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,760
it's easy it's simple this is not

383
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,240
complex you can buy that reader on the

384
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,279
on the right there for 130 bucks

385
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,680
you can buy hot air or reflow system for

386
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,200
another 130 bucks so for basically 270

387
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,600
bucks you could buy stuff off ebay and

388
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,600
strip critical data out of it for less

389
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,600
than three hundred dollars

390
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,000
very low entry point to compromising

391
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,399
critical data

392
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,440
so uh this one was interesting so i did

393
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,120
some stuff with light bulbs i like

394
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,959
bought crap little light bulbs and said

395
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,120
hey you know what kind of data's on it

396
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,199
can i get pre-shared keys off of it is

397
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,519
it easy i only focus on the ones that

398
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:02,800
were easy

399
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,959
i mean the data's there period simple as

400
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,600
that but how complex did they

401
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,160
did they obfuscated in some way did they

402
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,760
encrypt it in some way obviously they

403
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,360
encrypted the freaking keys are there

404
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,079
too so just a matter of hunt pecking to

405
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,839
find that type of stuff so i focus on

406
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,160
the ones that were easily compromised we

407
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,839
built these into exercises where we

408
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,040
demoed this at rsa we were talking about

409
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,959
from trash to treasure things you throw

410
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,560
in the trash well last year defcon doing

411
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,480
the iot thing i get a lot of people come

412
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,160
up to me afterwards start talking about

413
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,480
iot stuff so i had a gentleman come up

414
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,720
to me and he's like you know

415
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,199
he goes uh i have these smart bobs and

416
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,720
i'm like well what kind of smart bobs

417
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,880
are they enterprise or are they these

418
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,120
type of bulbs he's like these we have a

419
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,199
lot of small offices where there's like

420
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,440
three or four people in an office and we

421
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,440
don't have you know we just have regular

422
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,199
incandescent style

423
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,120
light bulbs or smart bulbs simple ones

424
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,440
you screw in he goes man i struggle with

425
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,880
the problem with these things failing on

426
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,480
me all the time and trying to manage

427
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,440
that

428
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,800
so we kind of addressed the whole

429
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,639
management thing of it you know how do

430
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,320
you how do you manage those and tell

431
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,920
when they're out and when they're on and

432
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,199
all that type of stuff the leds on these

433
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,440
burn out the power supplies on these

434
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,920
things blow out

435
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,680
when these things die

436
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,800
and no longer produce light

437
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,720
if you plug them into a network nine

438
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,480
times out of ten they're still on the

439
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,560
network that means they're still fully

440
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,920
functional that just the led

441
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,440
functionings fail

442
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,440
and even if everything fails on this

443
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,680
thing i assure you the data stored on

444
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,360
the flash memory is not going to fail

445
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,279
and most of these are fairly easy most

446
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,040
of them just have the white block there

447
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,079
happens to just be a wi-fi ship like

448
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,920
an express f or something like that

449
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,959
there's dozens of different

450
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,959
manufacturers out there

451
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,959
so in this particular case we just pull

452
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,800
that chip off we mount it on a test

453
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,639
board over there we hook four wires to

454
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,120
it put the thing into debug mode and use

455
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,639
a simple application to pull the

456
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,560
firmware off of it search through the

457
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,320
firmware there and we're quickly able to

458
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,240
find the ssid

459
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,160
and if i know what the ssid is on the

460
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,160
bulb or what it's broadcasting for

461
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,399
attempting to connect to it's easy to

462
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,160
search with it because

463
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,480
99 out of 100 times it's usually within

464
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,839
about five lines of that it's going to

465
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,399
be the pre-shared key in some form uh

466
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,920
and it's it and they're obviously

467
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,000
defined and this was the case we find

468
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,160
the pre-shared key it happens to be the

469
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,240
whole thing converted into hex

470
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,560
so we just run it through and convert it

471
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,920
back and we can see it right there

472
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,600
that's the pre-shared key on these

473
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,600
particular devices

474
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,120
so i actually showed all this to him

475
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,560
because i had this there so i showed him

476
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,079
how it all worked how easy it was to get

477
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,199
the data

478
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:42,880
oh the poor guy about crapped his pants

479
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,240
he's like man i've been throwing those

480
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,880
in the trash left and right

481
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,279
uh i don't know i don't really get into

482
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,680
dumpster diving but

483
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,040
hey man if you guys want to start

484
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,959
dumpster diving behind that uh local

485
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,800
business you might be surprised what you

486
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,240
find

487
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,120
smart bulbs contain data

488
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,279
kind of interesting data and this is so

489
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,039
simple to actually interact with these

490
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,799
uh ssid

491
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,439
or these wi-fi chip

492
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,919
devices manufacturers have all the data

493
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,160
out there and they often have a short

494
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,160
programming code that's available where

495
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,599
you can actually interact with it to

496
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,959
pull

497
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,039
various data off the device and interact

498
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,559
with the device in a number of different

499
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,160
ways

500
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,599
some of these are kind of interesting so

501
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,280
if you get these

502
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,000
these wi-fi chips

503
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,400
express f for example and you'll find

504
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,160
these in certain small end devices

505
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,520
that'll actually spin up their own

506
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,440
access points so if you think of

507
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,120
you think of a system that is kind of a

508
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,520
closed system solution

509
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,760
for example like an alarm system on your

510
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,440
house where all the pieces communicate

511
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,760
over wi-fi to each other it often has

512
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,120
its own wi-fi ssid structure that it

513
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,280
connects back to in that in that

514
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,240
environment when you use the default on

515
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,919
the expressives

516
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,840
you can actually connect into the device

517
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,120
and send an at command to it and say hey

518
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,440
what is your wi-fi pre-share key it'll

519
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,440
give it to you in clear text

520
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,280
as an example so you don't even have to

521
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,360
hack at it just ask it the right things

522
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,520
and it'll tell you if it's used as an

523
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,200
access point

524
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,440
another in a simple easy way to get data

525
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,640
off of it

526
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,120
i did this one just recently so air

527
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,200
links it's an industrial wireless lan

528
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,559
access point

529
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,919
and i've bought a couple of these over

530
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,520
the years just out of curiosity but

531
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,960
recently

532
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,320
i've been doing this particular

533
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,280
presentation uh at a couple places in

534
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,360
the last year so i just recently went

535
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,120
and bought one of these things this

536
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,559
airlinks

537
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,720
they're old which is what you do you

538
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,320
know they're industrial access points

539
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,679
people use them for a while and it's

540
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,039
like hey

541
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,559
things getting to be six seven eight

542
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,480
years old time to update it hey let's

543
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,799
make some money sell it on ebay

544
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,720
daryl buys it on ebay

545
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,640
i bring the thing home and i fire it up

546
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,120
look it's still broadcasting its factory

547
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,880
ssid

548
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,559
probably not a good thing i kind of

549
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,240
fuzzed it out there a little bit but you

550
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,919
could probably find it with that much

551
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,080
information so the thing is you can go

552
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,520
to wiggle

553
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,400
you go okay let's see if that

554
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,960
ssid is out there which i've done this

555
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,039
so every time i get a device and i steal

556
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,440
the ssid and pre-share keys

557
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,679
out of curiosity i look it up on wiggle

558
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,720
and go hey

559
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,240
can i identify where this is located at

560
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,840
in this case i was i was able to

561
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,520
identify it and actually find the

562
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,120
machine the one that actually replaced

563
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,280
it because they used the same ssid on

564
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,799
this device

565
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,039
so how many paychecks you want to bet me

566
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,720
that it's the same password

567
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,200
now obviously i can't check that that is

568
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,720
a crime

569
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,880
but

570
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,840
but i can almost bet my life on it that

571
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,120
it's that way and i've done this test on

572
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,000
a lot of technology that is commercial

573
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,559
level not consumer

574
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,480
some that i can't talk about yet because

575
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,679
it's still

576
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,000
issues that have to be dealt with

577
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,159
where i've done this and have been able

578
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,679
to get the

579
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,120
ssid and the pre-shared keys for upwards

580
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,120
of five to eight

581
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,840
major organizations

582
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,440
that's scary

583
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,679
that means we're not decommissioning

584
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,280
technology correctly because we forget

585
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,200
these are no different than a hard drive

586
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,840
they may be smaller

587
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,799
they may not spin around and make noise

588
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,280
but i assure you they contain just as

589
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,240
much

590
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,799
critically dangerous data

591
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,640
on those devices

592
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,480
now i don't encourage you to go out and

593
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,400
do this and then try to use the data

594
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,679
again like i said that is a crime

595
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,280
and it's all about security not

596
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,919
insecurity thus why i'm speaking here

597
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,840
i'm hoping everyone will go home and to

598
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,720
your business your organization and have

599
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,799
that discussion

600
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,720
what does this mean to your organization

601
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,799
what do we do with these devices how do

602
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,720
we handle these things

603
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,400
you know do we have contractual

604
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,840
agreements with

605
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,400
companies that are

606
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,799
we're licensing devices from or are we

607
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,559
just letting them take them away and

608
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,640
sell them as scrap with all your data on

609
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,440
it

610
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,840
something to think

611
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,679
about so what next how do we mitigate

612
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,919
these issues

613
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,000
there's no perfect answer here because

614
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,120
this is fairly new and it's an area

615
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,039
very few organizations have really given

616
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,799
much thought

617
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:29,520
so

618
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,600
the first steps awareness

619
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,720
here we are

620
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,640
we're all aware now

621
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,799
daryl's buying our off ebay

622
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,559
but i'm the good guy so you don't have

623
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,000
to worry about that

624
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,320
uh so i say go back have those

625
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,080
conversations

626
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,760
develop plans

627
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,440
one of the biggest problem with embedded

628
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,559
technologies in our in our businesses

629
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,200
is there's literally no ownership

630
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,039
they're plug and play you stick them in

631
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,559
the environment

632
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,039
nobody pays any attention to them ever

633
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,159
again they're shadow devices so if they

634
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,000
come in as shadow devices they're going

635
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,240
to go out as shadow devices with your

636
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,600
data

637
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,919
so start thinking about that start

638
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:13,520
developing ownership within your

639
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,000
organization on iot and embedded based

640
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,200
technology who owns it who's responsible

641
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,600
build a plan on de-acquisition of

642
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,720
technology so you're sure that hey we're

643
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,720
doing what's best for our organization

644
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,240
we know that we've done the factory

645
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,400
reset and we're comfortable that it's

646
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,760
been wiped

647
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,400
or we've contracted somebody else to do

648
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,200
that

649
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,559
or we

650
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,320
feed the thing into a giant metal

651
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,360
shredder and shred it into dust

652
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,400
actually nothing leaves my lab

653
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,600
with a

654
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,799
other than stuff that i give the

655
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,559
co-workers to do hacking on and stuff

656
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:49,520
like that

657
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,360
nothing will go out in disposable

658
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,600
electronic trash out of my house with an

659
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,919
actual flash memory chip on it

660
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,240
i literally remove them all and usually

661
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,440
smash them

662
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,120
or crush them now

663
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,919
most of us as consumers that's kind of

664
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,200
ridiculous to expect that and i don't

665
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,200
because you end up wasting half a day

666
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,799
probably cut your fingers off trying to

667
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,280
open some of these boxes sometimes

668
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,720
and then you have to figure out which is

669
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,320
the memory chip and how the hell do i

670
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,919
get it off the board

671
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,000
to smash it or what do i do and then if

672
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,799
you ain't wearing safety glasses oh gosh

673
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,480
i can only imagine the damage you could

674
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,120
do to yourself so i don't recommend that

675
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,000
but

676
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,360
that doesn't mean

677
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,000
as a commercial organization a business

678
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,360
you can't come up with a solution

679
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,760
ensures the data is not going out

680
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,679
and they'll build a plan for execution

681
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,440
how are we going to execute that and

682
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,440
make sure that moving forward problem

683
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,559
actually gets solved

684
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,880
so the planning and execution again

685
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,880
reiterate governance

686
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,840
create policies and ownership

687
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,240
of this technology

688
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,000
build that ownership as it enters the

689
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,760
door

690
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,360
don't wait until you have to get rid of

691
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,480
it

692
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,640
because because

693
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,960
on another subject i've been doing

694
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,520
embedded devices for

695
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,000
quite a few years i was a pen tester for

696
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,600
almost a decade

697
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,640
guess what my area of expertise was

698
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,720
attacking all your embedded devices on

699
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,080
your network to harvest data

700
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,320
or use those devices to carry out

701
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,760
attacks as red team operations so your

702
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,760
security operations centers running

703
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,279
around in circles wondering why that

704
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:32,320
xerox printer just carried out a an

705
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,880
attack against your active directory and

706
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,480
you don't know where it's coming from

707
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,799
you think it's the printer

708
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,799
so

709
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,320
ownership

710
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,039
of that technology as it's coming in the

711
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:48,240
door will also help with decommissioning

712
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,919
of the technology ensuring that you

713
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,679
don't have any problems so how would

714
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,520
this process look like like i mentioned

715
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,600
before wipe the device can we wipe it

716
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,080
can we clean it are we confident that

717
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,919
it's been cleaned hey if your

718
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,640
organization and you have like 10 000

719
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,320
embedded devices spread all over the

720
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,480
place and you want to know whether the

721
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,760
the factory reset worked or not

722
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,159
contact a company that does iot testing

723
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:13,360
and say hey

724
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,440
pull this see if the factory reset's

725
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,000
actually working at least confirm it

726
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,919
i can't expect that to cost you much

727
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,679
money it's going to take quite a few

728
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,600
hours worth of work for anyone that

729
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,679
knows what they're doing to be able to

730
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,000
validate whether a factory reset

731
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,320
actually removes the data or not

732
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,360
destruction feed it into a shredder

733
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,600
set it on i don't know get rid of it

734
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,240
make it go away and when it goes away it

735
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,039
goes away in pieces and dust

736
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,039
never assume that if you smash it with a

737
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,840
hammer that you successfully smash the

738
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,400
flash memory chip

739
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,559
if that chip is physically intact in any

740
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:55,120
way shape or form the data can be pulled

741
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,919
off it fairly easy

742
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,400
change accounts and passwords

743
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,960
so i worked at a fortune 500 company in

744
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,640
security

745
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,240
for a number of years for threat and

746
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,159
vulnerability so i was kind of like

747
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,720
giving them this awareness over a decade

748
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,559
15 years ago

749
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,039
and we often would change out our wi-fi

750
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,240
access

751
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,080
a lot of times when we did that we're

752
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,000
also upgrading the overall security

753
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,960
model that we're using whether as wpa

754
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,039
wpa enterprise whatever the case was

755
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,200
we're always up in the up in that and

756
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,480
every time we did we stood it up

757
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,760
separately

758
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,000
the old systems in place

759
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,159
stood it up separately

760
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,320
sent the appropriate keys and structures

761
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,320
to the workstations and laptops that

762
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,960
needed to access this once they all

763
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,720
switched over to the new system which

764
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,320
was different accounts different

765
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,799
passwords different ssids

766
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,480
then we were able to tear down the old

767
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,600
system

768
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,000
to me that is the smartest way to go

769
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,159
less likely this and then if you do

770
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:57,600
screw it up

771
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,120
they get accounts that are actually

772
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,960
worthless

773
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,799
and we had done that a couple times in a

774
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,520
fortune 500 company but if you're not

775
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,760
changing the security model often it's

776
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,159
easy to pull it out put a new one in

777
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,039
same ssid same keys so be careful about

778
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,279
that

779
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,760
so electronic waste disposal i think

780
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,760
this is critical we have literally too

781
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,720
much

782
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,520
electronic waste going into trash cans

783
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,799
and garbage

784
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,799
the sad part is there's currently no

785
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,039
federal law guidelines it says this is

786
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,600
how it's going to be disposed of

787
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,080
the eu uk on the other hand

788
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,000
very defined regulations and laws of

789
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,960
disposing technology

790
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,559
various states have different

791
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,360
regulations and guidelines around this

792
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,799
and of course since i'm in pittsburgh

793
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,520
pennsylvania electronic waste disposal

794
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,279
so they do have

795
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,200
government guidelines on how that should

796
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,240
be done

797
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,039
for device recycling or disposing of

798
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,159
those

799
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:01,919
if you're a large organization and have

800
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,600
the resources to handle some of this

801
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,760
cleanup stuff yourself

802
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,080
pretty good if if you don't then you're

803
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,480
going to contract this out to somebody

804
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,080
and again i recommend if you're

805
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,720
contracting out disposal don't give them

806
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,640
the opportunity to just walk out the

807
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,000
door with your data and sell it

808
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
somewhere make sure it's properly

809
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,919
disposed of and

810
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,399
properly disposed of legally

811
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,240
if it's going to go somewhere so it

812
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,000
doesn't end up in some landfill

813
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,760
inappropriately

814
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,679
and of course

815
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,600
pittsburgh has its electronic waste

816
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,200
disposal

817
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,120
this is kind of interesting

818
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,919
i advise taking a look at these things

819
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,399
if you as an organization go

820
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,240
i've never seen these before more than

821
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,559
likely you are now in violation of

822
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,679
pennsylvania state law

823
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,720
and you're doing it incorrectly so

824
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,799
make sure it happens because remember

825
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,679
and i worked at a fortune 500 company

826
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:59,520
and they were paranoid like crazy that

827
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,279
they were going to get sued

828
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:04,000
so all electronic stuff never actually

829
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,360
went to an employee if they were getting

830
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,679
rid of it and go out to an employee it

831
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,279
actually went through a disposal service

832
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:10,720
and was fed into a shredder and then

833
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,679
when disposed of through proper proper

834
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,039
means

835
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:18,320
but with what but with that said

836
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,159
make sure the per people you're hiring

837
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,240
are doing it right too because if they

838
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,159
take stuff say they're going to shred it

839
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,880
ends up on ebay and then that device

840
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,880
ends up somewhere it shouldn't be

841
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,880
often especially if it's a high brand

842
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,440
name product or something serial numbers

843
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,200
and it was acquired certain ways that is

844
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,440
traceable right back to your company and

845
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,520
that's why my fortune 500 company never

846
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,440
let anyone have anything

847
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,600
because they were scared that if they

848
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,919
gave somebody some laptop after it was

849
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,080
all done or some kind of device that

850
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,000
would end up in some landfill and get

851
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,600
traced back to them

852
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,600
so you need to take that stuff into

853
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,840
consideration and i'm actually running a

854
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,080
little fast today than i normally do on

855
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,279
this

856
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,200
so

857
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:01,919
i

858
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:03,120
think everyone should have some

859
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,640
questions for me so we have any

860
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,960
questions here

861
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,600
come on someone's got to have a question

862
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,080
yes sir

863
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:17,600
uh it's been a while uh i played around

864
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,320
with zigbee and some z-wave stuff

865
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,440
like three years ago uh unfortunately i

866
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,240
don't

867
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:24,960
i

868
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,200
when you get into certain aspects of

869
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,799
commercial stuff you see that so you

870
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,640
start seeing

871
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,120
variations that like uh um

872
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,039
or back then when i was playing around i

873
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,640
was seeing a lot of that stuff show up

874
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,960
or variations of that protocol in

875
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,520
electronic meters and stuff like that

876
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,600
i see a lot more of that

877
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,760
being tilted over to cellular based

878
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,559
communication for backhaul and stuff

879
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,240
like that

880
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,760
so

881
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,240
it's an interesting field we do uh we do

882
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,720
run assessment work for companies our

883
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,240
pen test teams

884
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,159
do that for iot type stuff and every

885
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:01,600
once in a while we'll get somebody comes

886
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,200
in has a zigbee or z-wave device

887
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,880
the old stuff was terrible

888
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,240
at least they've improved a lot of the

889
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,919
security uh with the uh the

890
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:14,799
zigbee the old the old zigbee like the

891
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:17,120
consumer-grade zigbee

892
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,559
and i'm sure they've fixed it now i

893
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,640
haven't looked at it but back in years

894
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,600
past

895
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,799
when you keyed it up it would actually

896
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,799
use the same encryption key and then

897
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,240
never change it

898
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,600
so all you would have to do is get the

899
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,200
encryption key which i think was

900
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,360
published on the internet

901
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,279
for that encryption so at that point

902
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,360
game over none of your zigbee stuff was

903
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,159
secure but as they get into more outside

904
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,480
the consumer grades zigbee and you get

905
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,320
into different protocols they have

906
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,399
different key rotations capabilities and

907
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,399
stuff like that so it's it's much better

908
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:49,919
from that standpoint

909
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,919
but no different if your disposal of a

910
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,240
device is still configured somebody

911
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,880
wants to pull that data off there uh it

912
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,880
could be critical now i have not tried

913
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,880
that because wi-fi stuff's so prevalent

914
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,880
and so easy to get data off of it but

915
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,480
like any of that type of stuff whether

916
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,200
it's

917
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,600
bluetooth any type of

918
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,000
wireless communication

919
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,840
if you don't factor your reset remove

920
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,760
your keys remove various things it's

921
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,600
going to go out the door containing that

922
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,200
data and that should be considered also

923
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,679
yes ma'am

924
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:27,360
medical medical devices i don't want to

925
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,120
go into a whole lot of medical devices

926
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,360
because

927
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,760
yeah there's issues

928
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,360
okay

929
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,200
so i actually have a research report on

930
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,440
that coming out later this year on

931
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,159
medical based technology in

932
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:45,760
this subject matter

933
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,000
which i think people will find quite

934
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,679
interesting and um

935
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,518
well that's dangerous

936
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:12,000
yeah i i have a yeah yeah

937
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,480
i have a but this is near field so and

938
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,480
you know you get to find out where my

939
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,720
sugar levels are at the moment so but

940
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,720
yes

941
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,720
okay so uh so i know a friend of mine

942
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,320
jay radcliffe a number of people here

943
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,480
may know him he's done a lot of security

944
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,559
research on medical devices

945
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,640
it was about five years ago he released

946
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,000
a whole uh

947
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,720
uh

948
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,960
research on an actual insulin pump where

949
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,480
he was actually able to decode all the

950
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,120
communications and it had the ability to

951
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,919
actually uh change that data and cause

952
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,720
an insulin pump to

953
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,760
yeah yeah yeah he worked he worked at

954
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,519
rapid seven when he released that paper

955
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:58,880
but it was work he had done before he

956
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,320
came over he just hadn't got around to

957
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,240
releasing it and literally you could

958
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,640
kill somebody with that so

959
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,039
so

960
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,399
the the the logic for doing it is is to

961
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,399
improve security

962
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:14,879
so so i so think about it when you deal

963
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:18,279
with these types

964
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,159
to kill somebody

965
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,280
yeah

966
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,320
yeah if i if i know not maybe not random

967
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,399
i mean i mean think about it if you

968
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,040
remember back um oh gosh the vice

969
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,159
president

970
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,440
uh under bush cheney yeah he had a

971
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,239
pacemaker and if you remember they came

972
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,440
out with a bunch of stuff on the

973
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,359
pacemakers and they went in and modified

974
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:43,280
his pacemaker specifically so think

975
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,280
about it you have someone in a position

976
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,800
of authority

977
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,040
a government leader in some fashion that

978
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,800
happens to be a diabetic and i assure

979
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,320
you there's probably plenty of them out

980
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,480
there

981
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,119
you could kill them

982
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,680
which is scary which is scary

983
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,800
randomly killing people yeah we already

984
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,960
have enough of that so

985
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,440
but to be able to kill people with this

986
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,440
it's a little more complex you have to

987
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,440
think it around think it through much

988
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,920
more as an attack vector to be able to

989
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,359
do that

990
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,680
to cost somebody their life

991
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,040
it i would expect you know a nation

992
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,119
state as an example

993
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:25,680
would really want to be able to do that

994
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,200
against another leader of another

995
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,079
country country or one of his political

996
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:31,839
opponents or something like that there

997
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,599
could be people wanting to do that in

998
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:34,640
some

999
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,040
some of these countries so i think it's

1000
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,800
a real threat so it's a good thing we

1001
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,480
have researchers i'm a big fan of

1002
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,040
researchers working with

1003
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,599
a medical companies to identify and

1004
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,359
solve these people these issues i think

1005
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:48,880
that's pretty good

1006
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,200
so any other questions

1007
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,680
yes sir

1008
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,839
you speak up a little bit

1009
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,200
um yeah so

1010
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,880
there's a number of chip readers out

1011
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,400
there um

1012
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,560
then they're fairly cheap they're

1013
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,800
like i said about 135 dollars for a chip

1014
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,560
reader that'll cover like

1015
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,720
eight nine thousand ten thousand

1016
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,560
different chips out there

1017
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,160
the sockets that go in those when you

1018
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,839
start getting into ball grid array chips

1019
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:31,520
could be 40 50 bucks out of out of china

1020
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,839
and i buy a lot of those

1021
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,680
and the ability to heat the board up or

1022
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,160
something to desolder it often those

1023
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,680
boards are small enough you could throw

1024
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,599
them into a hot air reflow oven i think

1025
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,480
the one i have i paid 150 bucks for it

1026
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,520
out of a chinese product

1027
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,880
inexpensive

1028
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,640
right there's all you need

1029
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,960
maybe some some stuff to clean some of

1030
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,000
the solder off of it some alcohol swabs

1031
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,440
you know things like that maybe a

1032
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,920
soldering iron and some solder wick you

1033
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,920
know so i i say less than 300

1034
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,359
you could go out there and do that you

1035
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:07,200
could easily look at blogs that i've

1036
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,720
posted online

1037
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,240
and you'll probably see

1038
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,560
various aspects of tools there

1039
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,079
from a from an iot research lab

1040
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,920
i did a presentation

1041
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,720
not last year but the year before a iot

1042
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,640
presentation online

1043
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,000
specifically on uh building out a lab

1044
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,480
so it was it was i did the whole demo in

1045
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,640
my lab with cameras set up all around so

1046
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,320
we looked at all the different hardware

1047
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,839
and stuff about what i could do with it

1048
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,240
how it worked what i used it for things

1049
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,960
like that so some good data out there

1050
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,200
for being able to get started if you're

1051
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,599
interested in doing this

1052
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,920
well if you're interested in iot

1053
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,760
research not if you're interested in

1054
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,680
getting other people's creds

1055
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,640
i don't encourage that

1056
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,359
any other questions

1057
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,520
yes sir

1058
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,960
yes most most of the time they are

1059
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,280
most of the organizations when i see a

1060
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,839
real vulnerability uh that's a true

1061
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:15,440
vulnerability the fact that data is

1062
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,680
stored on these devices

1063
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,400
unencrypted i think if you contact them

1064
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,320
like most of the light bulbs that i see

1065
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,560
now the data is actually

1066
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,880
encrypted or encoded or obfuscated in

1067
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,280
some fashion it is in clear text

1068
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,280
which is a good thing but some of them

1069
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,040
that's not the case uh i haven't looked

1070
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,720
at the version three of the amazon

1071
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,800
echoes but the ver previous versions you

1072
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,520
just you pull it it's kind of crazy so

1073
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,040
you have you have chips on them called

1074
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,560
embedded multimedia controllers they're

1075
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,680
typically

1076
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,440
uh i think with those they're called

1077
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,280
embedded multi-chip packages so they

1078
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,040
contain ram and flash on one ship so you

1079
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,480
have to have an oven to remove those

1080
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,480
those have on the underside of they have

1081
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,720
201

1082
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,200
quarter millimeter pads that balls go on

1083
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,200
to put it on that but you can buy these

1084
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,200
readers uh you get a cheap one for like

1085
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,240
90 but another one for uh

1086
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,720
135 bucks and what you do is you clean

1087
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,320
the chip up you drop it in you close the

1088
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,079
lid you plug it into usb and it mounts

1089
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:16,079
up like an sd drive so literally so this

1090
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,960
year this this year this year uh

1091
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,400
as a

1092
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,200
a pump for iot village at defcon our

1093
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,520
hands on exercise this year we're

1094
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,280
actually looking at cable modems where

1095
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,839
we've actually wired in a sd card

1096
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:31,200
breakout board

1097
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,359
to an embedded multi-chip

1098
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:34,560
or a

1099
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,280
embedded multimedia controller chip so

1100
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,920
you can just plug the actual cable modem

1101
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,640
into your sd card slot and actually

1102
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,960
mount all of the flash memory up just

1103
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,119
like a hard drive

1104
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,280
and from there pull data alter it put it

1105
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,200
back on to gain root level access that's

1106
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,280
what the demo is going to be

1107
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,280
so

1108
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,200
i don't think to hurt himself i mean i

1109
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,240
encourage people to go out and learn how

1110
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,319
embedded technology works

1111
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,319
it's how we that's how we get better at

1112
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:22,400
securing things is

1113
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,560
people to have an interest and learn how

1114
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,240
to do it

1115
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,240
you know before i was before i was doing

1116
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,160
this as my full-time job i was doing

1117
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,760
this research and

1118
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,760
speaking at conferences and publishing

1119
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,040
research

1120
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,920
15 almost 20 years ago i started doing

1121
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,880
this on my own so it wasn't sanctioned

1122
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,480
by any company

1123
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,119
and as a professional advance in my

1124
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:47,040
career if you want to go out there and

1125
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,040
get this stuff and do it illegally

1126
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,480
you're going to do it anything i'm

1127
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,240
saying you could find pieces and parts

1128
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,000
of this if not incomplete in various

1129
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,240
fashions online if you're going to do

1130
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,839
bad things

1131
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:59,520
me teaching you

1132
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,680
technology isn't going to make you any

1133
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,280
more dangerous you're already dangerous

1134
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,880
you're a criminal

1135
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,839
but

1136
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,640
i don't i don't necessarily believe

1137
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,760
uh 100 that's the case i see more and

1138
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,160
more vendors focusing on

1139
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,400
literally full disk encryption

1140
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,920
on ships

1141
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,160
so we encounter that more and more and

1142
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,079
more

1143
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:35,599
you know and you're seeing devices that

1144
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:36,560
use

1145
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,480
tpms so

1146
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,240
encryption models hardware-based

1147
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,640
encryption i mean the cost goes up and

1148
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,839
that's what you have to take into

1149
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:46,400
consideration but if it's a high-end

1150
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,359
product a commercial level product

1151
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:51,040
and you want to be able to get out there

1152
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,480
and claim you have some level of

1153
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,319
security which puts you a notch above

1154
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:55,920
everyone else

1155
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,440
then obviously you want to spend that

1156
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,640
little extra and you're just going to

1157
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:02,400
pass it on to to the consumer so seeing

1158
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,160
full full flash of full memory

1159
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,000
encryption is kind of cool

1160
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,160
uh without a tpm though if the device

1161
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,640
doesn't have a tpn or a sam chip on it

1162
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,359
for handling hard hardware-based

1163
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:15,680
encryption the keys are on there

1164
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,880
somewhere

1165
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,040
you know there's ways to hide those keys

1166
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,560
pretty safe

1167
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,960
but not they're never completely safe

1168
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,280
you know there's all kinds of crazy side

1169
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,800
channel attacks

1170
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,960
to get access to pieces of memory that

1171
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,119
you're not supposed to

1172
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:33,839
then but but you work you raise the cost

1173
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:35,520
you raise the amount of effort you raise

1174
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,839
the amount of cost so somebody can't

1175
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:39,760
just take a device get all the data off

1176
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,440
of it they have to go through and figure

1177
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,359
out what the encryption keys are

1178
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:45,200
encryption keys are held in a section of

1179
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,599
flash that that is locked down and

1180
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:49,920
prevented access the only way to do that

1181
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,599
is some kind of side channel attacks on

1182
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:54,079
the on the chips to be able to pull data

1183
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,760
off and things like that

1184
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,920
things are getting better you know it

1185
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,760
isn't like we have the status quo of

1186
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,079
nothing getting better i i see it and

1187
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,359
working with vendors on stuff like this

1188
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:07,839
and vulnerabilities and issues

1189
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:10,319
you know 10 years 15 20 years ago you

1190
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:11,760
know i dealt with vendors that didn't

1191
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,680
want to talk to me

1192
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,000
and and were always kind of problematic

1193
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
in nature and would take forever to fix

1194
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,480
things i would never just up and publish

1195
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,240
the data saying screw you and publish

1196
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:26,079
the data because i was running security

1197
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,560
for a large organization why would i

1198
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,560
want to make my life harder

1199
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,400
so i would just be patient and set on

1200
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,079
that unfortunately

1201
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,920
a lot of people just published that data

1202
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,760
back in when a vendor go ah screw you

1203
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,359
they would just publish it that's not

1204
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:42,000
the case it's pretty rare the only time

1205
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,920
i've ran into that issue is when i'm

1206
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,319
dealing with products that are like

1207
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:47,760
white labeled

1208
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,720
coming out of other countries

1209
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,560
where once they produce a million of

1210
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,560
these things they disappear or they

1211
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,920
don't care because they're producing

1212
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,839
something else those are the only

1213
00:43:57,839 --> 00:43:59,839
organizations i've ever contacted and

1214
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:03,119
they're like we don't care

1215
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:06,160
most u.s companies branded devices care

1216
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,839
about their security

1217
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:10,800
because failure within security is a

1218
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,200
black mark on them and they want to make

1219
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,200
sure that they're doing everything and

1220
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,960
they'll work with

1221
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,960
the work with researchers that actually

1222
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,359
care to do it properly

1223
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:22,800
to get their problems fixed which is

1224
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:23,680
nice

1225
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:27,279
i think i'm probably out of time

1226
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:30,240
okay any more questions

1227
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,280
these questions are good i like this

1228
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,200
no more questions

1229
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,200
okay well i hope you enjoyed this i hope

1230
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,800
you enjoyed the question section with

1231
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,560
some good stuff

1232
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,280
