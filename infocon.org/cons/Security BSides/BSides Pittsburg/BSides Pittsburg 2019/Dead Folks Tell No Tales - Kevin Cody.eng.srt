please go consult an estate attorney

92
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:39,440
this is some serious stuff things change

93
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,040
quite rapidly in this space and I am not

94
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,010
liable nor reliable enough to tell you

95
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,450
how you should handle your end affairs

96
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:51,590
so please take some of this and move

97
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:57,320
forward I am yeah it's kind of like a

98
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:02,690
lawyer but half-half is good so I'm

99
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,570
gonna be talking about death the the

100
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:08,570
honest-to-goodness truth is I'm talking

101
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,400
about giving away your stuff getting

102
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,790
access to your stuff after your life so

103
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,860
if this isn't a subject you want to talk

104
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,329
about if you feel uncomfortable about it

105
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:18,589
if you're dealing with something

106
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:21,168
personally I totally get it there's an

107
00:04:21,168 --> 00:04:23,360
awesome talk next door there's booze

108
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,880
there's drinks there's coffee help

109
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,750
yourself but I

110
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,580
certainly aren't here to bring up any

111
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,480
bad memories or anything like that and

112
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,890
policies that I'm gonna be talking about

113
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:38,220
may change in the future so you know if

114
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,970
Facebook or Google or whatever decide to

115
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,560
change how they handle things what's

116
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,080
required you know unfortunately those

117
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,280
things are out of my control but I can

118
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,860
hopefully give you a nugget to take back

119
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,870
and move forward so after all that why

120
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:55,410
are we here

121
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:58,710
what are we what are we doing here so

122
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:01,500
I'm gonna start this off with a story

123
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,020
it's a personal story but it's it's

124
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,760
honestly where I started thinking about

125
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:10,350
the subject so a few years ago actually

126
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,210
about seven years ago I was in my

127
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,400
mid-20s just started a new job was

128
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,600
literally a weekend and felt something

129
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,300
off something was it wasn't quite right

130
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,580
my wife happened to be in Germany

131
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,440
visiting her brother at the time she was

132
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,410
just me was FaceTime with my wife and

133
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:31,140
said hey something's not right I think I

134
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,460
think I need to go to the doctor you

135
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,460
know there's an issue and of course

136
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,740
she's halfway around the world and she's

137
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,970
asking me questions what are we gonna do

138
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,070
about this what's gonna happen here so

139
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,260
well one thing at a time so I go to the

140
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,300
doctor and sure enough I went on a

141
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,880
Saturday and Monday morning my doctor

142
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,180
calls and I've cancer I need to go have

143
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,650
an operation first thing Monday morning

144
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:53,910
they're actually I'm sorry Tuesday

145
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:55,200
morning because he called me on Monday

146
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,540
and luckily my wife was able to get home

147
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,690
from Germany and it was all good

148
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:03,300
operation everything was set no chemo no

149
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,430
radiation I'm as healthy as a horse now

150
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:08,790
but during that time I started thinking

151
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:12,570
I handle all of our finances I handle

152
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:16,290
the taxes I handle all of that stuff and

153
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,840
it started me thinking what would happen

154
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,850
if I wasn't here tomorrow

155
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,280
what would happen if my wife needed to

156
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,710
get access to my password manager or my

157
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:29,850
iPhone or what have you do are we

158
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,310
properly planning for these events

159
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,650
because it's it's it's very serious I'm

160
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,419
gonna go over a lot of scenarios here

161
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:38,760
that will hopefully have you thinking to

162
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,040
yourself what would I do in

163
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,810
situation how would I handle this or I

164
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,400
never even thought about that situation

165
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,350
that's really all I'm here to prime and

166
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,030
prepare you to do is to have those

167
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,560
difficult discussions and have those

168
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,450
conversations internally with your

169
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:54,630
friends family and what-have-you but I

170
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,400
am a technologist so I'm gonna break

171
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,920
down some of the technical terms and

172
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,900
hopefully do some education as well

173
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,780
because I see a lot of familiar faces

174
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,940
even faces who are calling me out for my

175
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,720
spelling and a lot of people are coming

176
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,000
here to me because you're used to the

177
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,040
technical content that I deliver so I'm

178
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,330
gonna hopefully give you a little bit of

179
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,010
that but honestly this is more of a soft

180
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:19,350
skills this is more of a conversational

181
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:23,220
type topic so yeah that's that's the

182
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,140
story so yeah we're gonna go over

183
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,880
authentication talk about some of the

184
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,340
different paradigms that are widely in

185
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,680
use today I'm gonna go over some

186
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,020
password vaulting solutions and discuss

187
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,120
some of the pros cons and and issues

188
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,920
with those I'm gonna hit on federated

189
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,410
authentication I'm gonna talk about why

190
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:43,080
we need to be quest I think I hit hinted

191
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,570
on that enough in my story but it should

192
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,100
be pretty obvious after we're going

193
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,390
through this stuff I'm gonna go over

194
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,310
some policies terms and conditions and

195
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:54,900
I'm gonna wrap up so authentication its

196
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,890
core right is something you have no or

197
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:01,620
are right those are the three pillars of

198
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,170
authentication so most of us are

199
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,430
familiar with your username and your

200
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:08,190
password right that's typical you know

201
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,820
in the early days of UNIX

202
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:14,070
you know and it was open system and and

203
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:17,070
people just use time sharing option and

204
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,750
didn't really have have usernames or

205
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:23,040
passwords and then you know we evolved

206
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,740
into this Multi multi user computing and

207
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,810
we started equipping usernames of

208
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,940
passwords and and private files and

209
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,560
whatnot so that's really the tried and

210
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,440
true as things continue to progress we

211
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,710
went to using biometrics right something

212
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:41,429
you are and I'll go into more about

213
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:43,229
different types of biometric

214
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:46,590
authentication we also have tokens or

215
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,000
certificates those are things that we

216
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,970
have they're not secrets per se but

217
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:53,460
they're objects that we hold on to so

218
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,570
you might be familiar with you

219
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:59,180
the keys or TLS certificates or SSH

220
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,990
certificates or whatnot these are the

221
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,390
things that you have in your possession

222
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:05,900
very similar to a key to a house and

223
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,180
then of course there's multiples of what

224
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,650
I just mentioned and that's when you

225
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,240
start talking about multi-factor

226
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,550
authentication that's using one or more

227
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:17,820
from those three groups it's something

228
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,720
you have and know or something you are

229
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,500
and have etc true multi-factor

230
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,680
authentication is not - from one group

231
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,830
so if you need a password and a pin

232
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,600
that's not multi-factor authentication

233
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,040
those are two things that you know so

234
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,010
next is 2-step verification so this is

235
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:44,400
very very popular right now are folks

236
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,140
familiar with 2-step verification where

237
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,660
you log into your bank and then they

238
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,330
text you a code and you put that code

239
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,970
back into your bank that's 2-step

240
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,710
verification it's not necessarily

241
00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:00,570
multi-factor although you do have access

242
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:03,930
to something that lets you receive that

243
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:06,510
code so it's kind of hybrid you have

244
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,720
something but there are some problems

245
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,910
with that thing that you have

246
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:14,520
particularly with SMS so there's this

247
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,000
thing called sim swapping it's very

248
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,360
popular right now in in the hands of bad

249
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,070
guys when it comes to Bitcoin or believe

250
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,870
it not like Instagram accounts and

251
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,420
getting getting access to you know

252
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,950
basically things that are protected with

253
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,800
with SMS short codes using this

254
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,070
two-factor verification and as always

255
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,170
the weakest link in this scenario is

256
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,240
gonna be the carrier right I happen to

257
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,960
work for a carrier for four years I know

258
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,400
many many calls many many situations

259
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,890
where you try to authenticate someone

260
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,330
you try to get their password you try to

261
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,970
get you know whatever it is that you

262
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,920
need for them to verify themselves and

263
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,600
they don't have it or they forgot it or

264
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,620
you're trying to write you know they're

265
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,880
trying to rush you and you're trying to

266
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,770
do everything you can do to resolve the

267
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,600
call and the first time they call you or

268
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,860
help them when they're standing in front

269
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,250
of you

270
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,410
and you forgot to verify who they were

271
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:12,090
you they didn't tell you the pin or you

272
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,380
didn't do something in the right order

273
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,860
well everything that has to do is 2-step

274
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,500
verification hinges on the fact that you

275
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,900
are the sole owner or person who has

276
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:25,590
access to this device this phone this

277
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:28,230
laptop that gets my messages whatever

278
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:31,470
the case may be and it's to the point

279
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,570
where NIST the National Institute of

280
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:36,090
Standards and Technology in the special

281
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:41,130
publication six 863 B has even said SMS

282
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:44,580
to sub verification is deprecated the

283
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,350
interesting part of that is they didn't

284
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,570
even acknowledge SMS to factor

285
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:51,090
verification until this publication so

286
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:53,160
they introduced it and deprecated it in

287
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,440
the same document what does that tell

288
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,330
you it's just really not up to snuff

289
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,460
compared to the other two three factors

290
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,550
that that we talked about now all of

291
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:05,280
that said it's still better than nothing

292
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,650
show hands who's heard of credential

293
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:11,180
stuffing whoa that's a lot of hands

294
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:16,260
really awesome all right well I'm not

295
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,970
gonna take a long time on this though so

296
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,710
credential stuffing is taking leaked

297
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,240
creds from databases and putting them

298
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,310
into into forms on different databases

299
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,960
right so take your leaked creds from

300
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,300
LinkedIn from 2011 put them into your

301
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,650
Facebook account and see if those creds

302
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:29,280
still work

303
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,320
that's credential stuffing but 90% of

304
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,490
you have already heard of that which is

305
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,800
awesome it was not the case five years

306
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,830
ago right so what is too fat two-step

307
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:40,350
verification stops it stops credential

308
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:43,860
stuffing right your random attacker who

309
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,770
gets your pone passwords from some dark

310
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:49,290
web or some you know stale database on

311
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:51,150
paste bin somewhere they're gonna run

312
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:54,480
into this issue where up there's an SMS

313
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,870
you know going out of band 90% or 99% of

314
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,370
accounts aren't going to be worth that

315
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,770
attacker then taking that and trying to

316
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:04,080
do a sim swapping attack or trying to

317
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,810
social engineer your rise in accounts to

318
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,160
get them to switch the number into yours

319
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,270
or what have you

320
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,770
right so it's still better than nothing

321
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:12,330
I'm not telling you to go home and

322
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:15,660
disable 2-step verification to then back

323
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,310
up to only passwords that'd be silly

324
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,290
right but there's obviously better

325
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,440
better options out there

326
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,870
one of those bitter options are totp and

327
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:29,130
H OTP so who there better be less hands

328
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:30,390
this time or I might just walk upstate

329
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:32,700
who here is familiar with TOTP and H OTP

330
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,260
all right less hands

331
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:39,510
okay so time-based one-time passwords or

332
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:43,980
H Mac based one-time passwords right OTP

333
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:47,820
is the same across so one-time passwords

334
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,100
are these codes that you see with apps

335
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:54,110
like Google Authenticator or duo or

336
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:56,670
authy there's these rolling codes and

337
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,710
it's somewhat similar to if you've ever

338
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:01,080
used an RSA token except for you don't

339
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,120
have a token right that's being done on

340
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,140
the application and the protocol that is

341
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,270
with the exchange of those tokens and

342
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:11,880
how the server matches up which tokens

343
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,060
you should have and allows you are T OTP

344
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:19,470
and H OTP so the secrets to that

345
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:23,040
exchange whenever you get the secret to

346
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,220
start that that handshake that's

347
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,900
everything if someone can get access to

348
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:33,590
the secret key of your TOTP or H OTP

349
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:37,650
initiation it's all over where do you

350
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:41,130
think that secret is hint it's the large

351
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,230
image on the screen right now where's

352
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,880
where is that image at or where's that

353
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:51,960
secret at where the QR code oh sorry the

354
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:57,600
QR code QR codes everything I can tell

355
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,740
you one time I was doing an application

356
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:03,930
assessment and I saw a situation where

357
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,640
there was a QR code that was generated

358
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,970
and that QR code was generated from a

359
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:11,430
Google service and that Google service

360
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:15,240
just accepted like okay this is the

361
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,310
message I'm one of the QR code send it

362
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:19,710
to me in the URL okay now here's a QR

363
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:23,010
code back okay and then the client then

364
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:24,060
scan the QR code in the application

365
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,250
everything on the surface looked okay

366
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,590
but what was actually happening was the

367
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:31,140
QR the secret was sent in the URL so

368
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,640
it's cached in a bunch of places in your

369
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,370
browser

370
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,290
not the QR code when it got back to your

371
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:37,240
browser was cached locally in your

372
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,610
browser so now anyone who has access to

373
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,140
your computer could go out and scan that

374
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,360
QR code and the Google service that did

375
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,160
it all said right in the Terms of

376
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,750
Service don't use this for anything

377
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,089
critical or secret and it was a

378
00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:50,920
deprecated Google service so it was like

379
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,450
four strikes you're out it was it was

380
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:54,370
terrible but what I'm trying to get at

381
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,790
here is the QR code is everything in

382
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,040
this process the transfer of the secret

383
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,820
is everything when it comes down to TOTP

384
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,970
versus h OTP I'm not gonna harp on that

385
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:10,120
today ones time based ones H Mac based

386
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,470
you can really tell the difference if

387
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,240
you open up your google app or your duo

388
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,730
app if it's rolling every 30 seconds

389
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:18,220
it's time based if it's static until you

390
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,330
submit it and then you get a new one

391
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:23,010
it's H Mac based but behind the scenes

392
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:25,839
you're really just extrapolating that

393
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,940
one-time password that out-of-band

394
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:31,570
verification from the SMS portion which

395
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:35,260
is inherently flawed right so TOTP h OTP

396
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:39,160
infinitely better than SMS then there's

397
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,140
this thing called Fido which is fast

398
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,529
identity online the roots of Fido were

399
00:16:44,529 --> 00:16:47,770
in these protocols called UAS and u2f

400
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:49,930
UAF was a universal authentication

401
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:52,570
framework u2f was a universal second

402
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:57,400
factor there's a lot of detail in here

403
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,450
I'm going to show you a quick flow

404
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,000
diagram here coming up but what you

405
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,620
should know is the the protocol is

406
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,900
typically rooted in some type of secure

407
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,619
Enclave as Apple would call it your

408
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:10,270
secure Enclave or a trusted platform

409
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:14,800
module or HSM or basically this special

410
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,750
chip that is read-only and does trusted

411
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:25,119
trusted computations and the let me skip

412
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,140
ahead and I'll just show you how this

413
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,470
works so you have an application and

414
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:33,910
you're using Fido to use as a second

415
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:40,690
factor or a secret conformation so the

416
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:43,360
client is your app could be a web app

417
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,950
could be a mobile app whatever the case

418
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:47,230
may be the server is whatever

419
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,179
business you're doing business with and

420
00:17:49,179 --> 00:17:53,320
the user of course is you so you log in

421
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,270
to the application using your username

422
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:57,520
and password the phyto service comes

423
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,950
back and says hey this is what I know

424
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,590
how to talk this is what I can do let's

425
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,450
let's give you some options make sure

426
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,010
you have all these different things and

427
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:08,890
if so let's start this thing so you can

428
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:11,820
see here that the requirements and the

429
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,799
attributes are this person has to have a

430
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,980
TPM a place that I can do these these

431
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,980
cryptographic safe operations in a safe

432
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,919
way I offer the ability to do

433
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,750
fingerprint off face authentication

434
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,660
voice authentication basically biometric

435
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:32,440
authentication I feed the response into

436
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,200
the user and the user says hey this is

437
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,900
what I want to do and they enroll and

438
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:41,860
when that enrollment takes place some

439
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,020
type of secret is generated at that

440
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,820
first handshake and then it's sent over

441
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,799
from the server from that point on

442
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:50,350
there's this challenge response type

443
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,970
handshake that happens every time you

444
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:54,940
use the service and because you started

445
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,650
off with a known state you did a

446
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,480
cryptographic operation and then sent

447
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,270
back the response the server can repeat

448
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,100
that process over and over again and

449
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,429
confirm that it's you and there's a lot

450
00:19:06,429 --> 00:19:08,200
more detail that goes into this process

451
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,360
but what you should know is there was

452
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,190
basically two protocols that came out of

453
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:14,590
that there's a universal two-factor

454
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:17,320
basically a way for anyone out there to

455
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,490
use this as a second factor

456
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,380
authentication and then there was also

457
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,080
the universal authentication framework

458
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,330
which is basically using this as your

459
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,030
identity this was you you could log into

460
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:32,140
a machine without any type of extra auth

461
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:37,780
and out of that process web auth end was

462
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:41,200
born which now is Fido - and if you're

463
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,390
familiar with like Windows hello or

464
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:48,309
actually even Twitter now offers web off

465
00:19:48,309 --> 00:19:51,010
and standard that is basically the

466
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:53,679
evolution of the Fido protocol and the

467
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,169
the underpinnings are the same things

468
00:19:56,169 --> 00:19:58,780
you see here in the flow chart but there

469
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,669
are some additional handshake

470
00:20:00,669 --> 00:20:01,989
there's additional requirements or

471
00:20:01,989 --> 00:20:03,850
whatnot but this is the whole idea of

472
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:06,369
Fido and you can see where we kind of

473
00:20:06,369 --> 00:20:09,730
took the idea of the the okay I get a

474
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:11,769
code from some man or I put the code in

475
00:20:11,769 --> 00:20:14,440
you verify it and we kind of amp that up

476
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,080
we took the process of not only are you

477
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,149
or is the server sending you something

478
00:20:19,149 --> 00:20:20,889
in which you're verifying and sending

479
00:20:20,889 --> 00:20:24,399
back you're using a portion of you which

480
00:20:24,399 --> 00:20:27,100
is unique to you being fingerprint or

481
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,799
face or voice and we're doing a

482
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:31,929
cryptographic operation on that and

483
00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:34,899
proving that it is the person who

484
00:20:34,899 --> 00:20:36,820
originally subscribed to this method

485
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,039
right so Fido is really really

486
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:44,769
interesting and cool so then I briefly

487
00:20:44,769 --> 00:20:46,570
touched on this before certificates

488
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:48,369
right these are things that we have you

489
00:20:48,369 --> 00:20:49,859
might be familiar with certificates from

490
00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:56,409
SSH or mutual TLS certificates or pivot

491
00:20:56,409 --> 00:20:58,749
charts if you're from the government

492
00:20:58,749 --> 00:21:01,450
type right you had the old guv

493
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:04,210
pip smart cards but basically there

494
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:07,830
isn't much verification of who you are

495
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:10,619
other than the fact that you have

496
00:21:10,619 --> 00:21:14,619
possession of this thing again it's not

497
00:21:14,619 --> 00:21:17,799
much different than a key if we take

498
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:19,509
that a step further there's a key to our

499
00:21:19,509 --> 00:21:23,109
front door the door is expecting this

500
00:21:23,109 --> 00:21:25,690
key if you put the key in everything

501
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:27,879
lines up the door opens if we take that

502
00:21:27,879 --> 00:21:31,440
same thought and extrapolate that out to

503
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,100
certificates and TLS if you could

504
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:40,419
imagine an entity that had all the keys

505
00:21:40,419 --> 00:21:43,269
to all the houses on your street and in

506
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:46,539
your city and that that entity said

507
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:49,029
you're this person here's your key

508
00:21:49,029 --> 00:21:50,619
you're this person here is your key this

509
00:21:50,619 --> 00:21:53,619
your this person here's your key that's

510
00:21:53,619 --> 00:21:55,090
the trust that we're putting into our

511
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:57,700
certificate authorities we're trusting

512
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,559
that those certificate authorities are

513
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:01,869
properly vetting who people say they are

514
00:22:01,869 --> 00:22:05,109
and giving out the proper keys and and

515
00:22:05,109 --> 00:22:07,480
saying that yes you are going to this

516
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,700
person you have that trust you're good

517
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,019
to go

518
00:22:10,019 --> 00:22:14,110
mutual TLS is is basically with

519
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,610
out the certificate authority this is

520
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:17,890
where you have a TLS cert and you're

521
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:20,620
presenting that to someone who's

522
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:24,730
verifying that went on this before not

523
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:26,530
going to go into into this in huge

524
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:28,179
detail but of course there's all the

525
00:22:28,179 --> 00:22:30,250
biometric things touch ID Android

526
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:33,460
fingerprint sensor iris scans face

527
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:36,880
detection voice recognition hand prints

528
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,070
combination of you know basically

529
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:42,250
anything that you can do I just read or

530
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,559
heard about a new laser that someone's

531
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,080
using that detects your heart cadence

532
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,179
and they can tell by your heart

533
00:22:49,179 --> 00:22:51,520
palpitations that you are who you are I

534
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,230
don't know but these are things that you

535
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:55,299
can't change about yourself without some

536
00:22:55,299 --> 00:22:59,169
serious like plastic surgery and Mission

537
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:04,390
Impossible or something okay who

538
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:10,299
here uses a password vault keep your

539
00:23:10,299 --> 00:23:12,400
hands up keep your hands up I want you

540
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,840
to look to your left or look to your

541
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,730
right and if you see one of your friends

542
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:17,620
or family who aren't using password

543
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,900
vaults your homework is to help

544
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,820
introduce password vaulting to that

545
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,190
person you know you're getting homework

546
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:28,390
today you're the TA I want you to check

547
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:29,710
the homework and make sure that this is

548
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:31,150
done all right

549
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:35,590
so password managers there's two types

550
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:36,910
of password managers there's online

551
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,679
password managers and there's offline

552
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:41,679
password managers of course it's however

553
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,470
cloud comfortable you are with that

554
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,150
there's all kinds of security and

555
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:49,090
mechanisms and and thousands of rounds

556
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:52,960
of key derivation and all kinds of fun

557
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,309
stuff that goes into protecting your

558
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:56,470
identity and only you can open this and

559
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,929
so on and so forth but the idea behind a

560
00:23:58,929 --> 00:24:00,850
password manager right is that you have

561
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:05,980
a single key that unlocks all of your

562
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,210
other keys so it's like when you go to

563
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:09,130
the card car dealership and they have

564
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:11,020
that box on the wall and they put a key

565
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,790
in and they open that box and there are

566
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,350
all the keys to all the other cars

567
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:16,330
that's probably like an 80s reference I

568
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:17,710
think they have a machine like a vending

569
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:19,210
machine that Divis them out now yeah

570
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:24,280
I've seen them know anyway so that's the

571
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,100
idea behind this you

572
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:30,150
possess the key box you possess the key

573
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:32,850
in your mind that opens the key box so

574
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:34,890
of course knowing that password

575
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:38,160
knowing that initial password is still

576
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,590
extremely important but inside of that

577
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:45,090
key box is a bunch of other keys you

578
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:46,950
don't necessarily even need to know and

579
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:49,230
one of the really cool benefits of a

580
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:51,900
password vault or password manager is it

581
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:55,020
can do verification for you to make sure

582
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,059
you're putting the password into the

583
00:24:57,059 --> 00:25:00,330
correct site right so when you visit a

584
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:02,220
site if you have the browser add-in

585
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,919
added to you know your your phone or

586
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:06,140
your browser what-have-you

587
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,270
it'll actually pop up and say hey this

588
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:11,250
is Facebook this is your password for

589
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,500
Facebook log in if someone sends you a

590
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,289
fish or social engineering and they send

591
00:25:16,289 --> 00:25:18,870
you face but instead of the a it's the

592
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:21,059
you know Punic code version of a with a

593
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:22,230
little dot but you can't see the little

594
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,880
dot because it's above the fold whatever

595
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,250
the case is your password manager won't

596
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,980
offer your Facebook password for you to

597
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,720
log in with right so that's a huge

598
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,360
benefit to password managers and vaults

599
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,450
and the fact is I just ended my job

600
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:38,250
yesterday with my consulting company I

601
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:41,669
knew one password for all of the

602
00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:43,620
hundreds of systems and client systems

603
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,940
and all the stuff that I logged into I

604
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,549
knew one password and that was to get

605
00:25:47,549 --> 00:25:49,679
into my password vault yesterday when I

606
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,659
turned in my computer I can honestly say

607
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:54,030
I have no access to anything and it's

608
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,470
not because they revoke the access which

609
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,240
I'm sure they did but it's because I

610
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,280
never knew any passwords anything right

611
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,770
password managers are awesome and

612
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:04,650
they're even coming to the point of they

613
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:07,919
have scraped the internet and and have

614
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,929
confirmed what different password

615
00:26:09,929 --> 00:26:11,460
requirements are for this site and that

616
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,200
site in this and they can help you

617
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,659
create the most entropy rich password

618
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:19,500
for a certain site so creating a bunch

619
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,630
of unique passwords for every site

620
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:23,640
you've ever visited creating really

621
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,860
strong passwords that are unique based

622
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,780
on all the crazy-ass requirements that

623
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:30,450
all these sites have and doing all of

624
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:31,830
this and being able to verify that

625
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,600
you're putting the password into the

626
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,549
proper site how many of you can say that

627
00:26:35,549 --> 00:26:38,880
you can do all of that in here

628
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,190
no one right we just can't do that where

629
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:44,910
does not program to be able to make hard

630
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:47,850
to guess unique passwords for everything

631
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:50,840
we touch so password managers are

632
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,770
absolutely crucial

633
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:55,520
now there's also this thing about

634
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,170
grandma's passbook that has you know

635
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:02,760
it's a yellow manila or a yellow sheet

636
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,320
of paper and has all of the passwords

637
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,100
written on that

638
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,780
don't knock grandma's passbook unless

639
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,130
someone's breaking in to get into

640
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:09,870
Grandma's house it's gonna take that and

641
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:13,050
go to her you know Medicaid and try to

642
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:15,150
you know or Social Security and try to

643
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,950
do stuff that's actually a lot better

644
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:18,840
I'd rather see someone create a strong

645
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,330
unique password or at least somewhat

646
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:24,030
unique by writing it down and putting it

647
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:26,550
somewhere that's secure then remembering

648
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,110
all the crazy passwords right cuz if

649
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,460
grandma has to remember all her

650
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,200
passwords you know that's gonna be

651
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,480
password one two three it is there's no

652
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,950
doubt about it in my mind that's gonna

653
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:37,140
be the password and then when she can't

654
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,700
get into our site she's gonna call you

655
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,130
and say hey Kevin I'm trying password

656
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:42,600
one two three and it's not working and

657
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,560
then you're gonna have to remember oh

658
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,620
its capital P and an exclamation point

659
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,210
on the end grandma its password one two

660
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:50,220
three exclamation right so don't knock

661
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,770
the password books every few months this

662
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:54,450
thing starts up on Twitter like oh my

663
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:56,910
gosh have you seen this book they sell

664
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:58,410
at Barnes and Nobles it's called the

665
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,330
password book can you believe how

666
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:03,030
ignorant they are in reality it's

667
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:05,010
probably not that bad you still have to

668
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:06,270
use your brain to come up with different

669
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:08,250
combination it's not it's not as good as

670
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:10,560
a password vault but it's not terrible

671
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,240
as long as you can protect that and put

672
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,970
it somewhere safe all right so we're 20

673
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:20,130
plus minutes in and I've hit you with a

674
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:22,050
lot of authentication protocols and

675
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:25,050
standards and mechanisms and I hope what

676
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:26,220
you've taken out of that is things are

677
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:29,040
changing quickly right things are

678
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,200
already keep up with attackers are doing

679
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,010
new things

680
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,720
we're combative them we're changing

681
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,950
things up physical keys biometric codes

682
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:40,020
they can't be remembered or verbally

683
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,600
transmitted to someone or passed down to

684
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,760
a loved one right so we have these

685
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,650
things where at least the pass were like

686
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:48,780
oh you know you know unfortunately

687
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:51,240
so-and-so passed but we know that he

688
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,440
always used smokey

689
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,590
877 for his passwords so at least we

690
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:58,680
know how to get into the mortgage so

691
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,660
that we can make this payment until the

692
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,640
death certificate comes and we can get

693
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,020
absolved from that or whatever the case

694
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,660
is right well do you think that works

695
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:09,960
when the deceased person's finger isn't

696
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,410
around anymore to open their phone or

697
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:16,860
they have a voice as their password when

698
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,470
they call the Social Security office

699
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:22,620
quick story the big government offices

700
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,330
like Social Security they're using

701
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:27,360
what's called passive biometric software

702
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,060
to confirm if you're out if the person

703
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:34,440
who originally called is still the same

704
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,780
person who's calling today so the days

705
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:39,500
of you calling and collecting your

706
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,300
significant others pension for life or

707
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,700
benefits for life and you call and you

708
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,530
just pretend to be them and you hope

709
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:48,540
that someone doesn't pick up that's over

710
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:51,240
they have enough data saved up an old

711
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,630
calls that they can create an identity

712
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:58,260
that they know is you or is enough like

713
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:58,560
you

714
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,350
and once you variant out of that model

715
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:04,170
they know hey something's not quite

716
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:06,300
right send someone to their house or ask

717
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,890
them for additional identification or

718
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:08,970
something that's called passive

719
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:11,490
biometric data it's a real thing it's

720
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:14,550
being used to combat fraud today and it

721
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:18,090
can't be faked maybe a twin brother or

722
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:21,450
sister or maybe you know if you get

723
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:24,120
really lucky you might be able to but in

724
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,220
the vast majority of the cases it's

725
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:30,150
rock-solid right and again the days of

726
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:32,280
remembering passwords are over I'm not

727
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,840
remembering passwords anymore one

728
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,220
password I don't use that password

729
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:38,040
anywhere other to unlock the box of keys

730
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:42,600
on the wall so what do we do like what

731
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,170
are we doing today to recover if we lose

732
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:51,780
our passwords so currently this is the

733
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,730
flow that happens if you forget your

734
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:55,890
password you choose a forgot password

735
00:30:55,890 --> 00:31:00,090
option you enter the answers to your

736
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:03,300
secret question right which the secret

737
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,460
questions aren't usually that great when

738
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,400
I was was in

739
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,210
there was this idea of out-of-pocket

740
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:12,220
questions and what that means are if I

741
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,409
get your wallet how many security

742
00:31:14,409 --> 00:31:17,590
questions can I answer from just having

743
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:19,480
your wallet can I google your school's

744
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:24,400
mascot can I look on Facebook and get

745
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,700
your first car model etc etc right you

746
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,870
have to have things that are out of

747
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:31,990
pocket out of so that's where the whole

748
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,120
favorite thing came from what's your

749
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,279
favorite restaurant what's your favorite

750
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:37,630
book these are things that you can't

751
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:40,480
really until you go to Facebook quiz and

752
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,279
you pull out the quiz that's right but I

753
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:46,059
digress out of pocket are the secret

754
00:31:46,059 --> 00:31:47,770
questions and hopefully everyone's using

755
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:50,320
so you enter that you get a link in the

756
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,409
email you create a new password and

757
00:31:53,409 --> 00:31:55,659
you're in it's pretty frictionless this

758
00:31:55,659 --> 00:31:59,110
is actually not a bad state you can swap

759
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:00,850
the two things you could get the link in

760
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:02,200
the email and then answer your secret

761
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,220
questions it's probably a little bit

762
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:06,580
better but overall that's really how

763
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,049
things are done today this is this is

764
00:32:08,049 --> 00:32:11,169
the standard so some things that are

765
00:32:11,169 --> 00:32:13,240
better than the standard right

766
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:16,720
out-of-band SMS so although again SMS

767
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,820
isn't the best if you can text someone

768
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,260
the number that you have and have them

769
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,179
verify it's better than everything else

770
00:32:22,179 --> 00:32:25,870
I just said right SSH key verification

771
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:27,370
this is pretty cool does anyone ever

772
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:29,380
lost your password have done the forgot

773
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:34,299
password for github one person I am with

774
00:32:34,299 --> 00:32:36,130
you I lost access to my github for six

775
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:37,390
months that's a different story

776
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:40,570
anyway SSH key verification so github

777
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:43,419
actually reached out to me like hey all

778
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:46,330
else failed you can't you can't give me

779
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:47,890
the key you can't give me the password

780
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:50,140
you give me the recovery codes we can't

781
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,440
verify your DNA whatever the case is

782
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:57,039
send us a challenge with SSH your public

783
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,659
and you know we'll do a handshake and if

784
00:32:58,659 --> 00:33:00,970
you have the private key there's pretty

785
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:02,890
good chance that you're you right so

786
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:04,360
that's kind of neat that's that's it

787
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,080
that's a different thing

788
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:08,159
some do snail mail right this has been

789
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:11,620
happening for a while right you just

790
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,899
like wait for a password reset code to

791
00:33:13,899 --> 00:33:15,610
come in the mail and hope that someone

792
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:16,990
doesn't steal it out of the mail right

793
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:19,750
I'm not saying it's great but it's not

794
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:22,660
Wurst and I don't know there's others

795
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:25,840
can grab a coffee or a monster after

796
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,830
this and we can chat about other

797
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,090
mechanisms that you think I should

798
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,740
should be including in this right but

799
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:33,370
regardless forgot password' mechanisms

800
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:37,060
are pretty straightforward but what

801
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:39,160
happens when we can't go through that

802
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,770
process there's a locked code there's a

803
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,990
locked phone we don't have access to

804
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:47,470
this well we have some deceased recovery

805
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:52,000
processes as well so Gmail actually has

806
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,070
this thing called the nickname the

807
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:59,830
Deadman switch which comes from trains

808
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,840
okay I was gonna say military from from

809
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,600
you know holding in the the detonator

810
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,100
and when they would die they would

811
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:11,350
release it and okay regardless the idea

812
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:13,929
is that you have to actively respond to

813
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:16,659
something and if you don't actively

814
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:18,460
respond to something something else

815
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,050
happens in Gmail has this this this

816
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:22,090
method where if you don't actively

817
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:24,190
confirm that you're alive and you have

818
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:27,570
access you can basically bequeath your

819
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:30,639
access to somebody else Facebook has a

820
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:33,340
couple interesting things as well they

821
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,800
have these legacy contacts will they'll

822
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,469
reach they'll allow certain contacts to

823
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:43,060
do a limited set of actions on your

824
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,399
behalf including the ability to set up

825
00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:48,429
memorials on your account and tributes

826
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:50,260
which is something a little bit newer

827
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:53,230
right but you know I don't know about

828
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:55,179
you but Facebook and Gmail are pretty

829
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:56,679
significant parts of my digital life

830
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:58,540
right now and the fact that these at

831
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,490
least these two have gotten to the point

832
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:03,430
where they're trying to plan ahead of

833
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:06,280
this process which is pretty you know

834
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,980
it's it's it's not a fun process to go

835
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,750
through I think we've all been had at

836
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:13,420
least grandparent aunt uncle friends

837
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,860
someone who's passed away you're trying

838
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,480
to pick the pieces back up and put

839
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,030
things together and trying to find all

840
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:21,220
of these odds and ends out on top of

841
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,050
dealing with this kind of stuff it's

842
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:26,190
it's it's really difficult

843
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:29,140
password managers have also of course

844
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:33,670
thought of this process and they've of

845
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,230
course named it all emergency which

846
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,340
isn't confusing at all

847
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,650
LastPass as emergency access - lien has

848
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:40,420
emergency and one password has emergency

849
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:42,580
kit and they all do things a little bit

850
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:45,490
different my favorites LastPass

851
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:47,440
emergency access and basically you go in

852
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,810
it's actually pretty similar to - Lane

853
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:52,740
you go in and you designate basically

854
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:55,390
successors and you say I trust this

855
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:57,820
person I know and whatnot and LastPass

856
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:00,480
actually has this this neat thing where

857
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,210
one single person can't take over

858
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:05,800
everything you actually have to have you

859
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,080
can set it so multiple people are

860
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,940
basically entering the whole two keys to

861
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,920
the missile sort of thing multiple

862
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,560
people have to get together which could

863
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,480
be an issue if those people aren't

864
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,030
talking or something happens there's a

865
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:22,330
rift of something but you know basically

866
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:24,310
these password managers have come up

867
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:27,520
with ways of allowing you to designate

868
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,100
emergency contacts one thing to note

869
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,580
this is kind of the nuclear option if

870
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:35,020
something happens and the emergency

871
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:37,900
access is invoked you lose access to

872
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,910
your password vault you key the owner

873
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:41,740
are hopefully not around anymore

874
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:45,460
hopefully not I don't whatever the case

875
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,410
is you're not around anymore your

876
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:49,210
LastPass access is gone because people

877
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:52,450
have invoked the nuclear option one

878
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:55,540
password doesn't quite have the cards in

879
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,710
place yet they have this thing called

880
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:59,500
emergency kit which is a piece of paper

881
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,330
that has a recovery code printed on it

882
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:04,900
and you're supposed to put that

883
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:09,520
somewhere safe yeah and then key pass

884
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,890
doesn't have anything it's just like an

885
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:13,990
offline password vault hopefully you

886
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:15,850
know someone who can recover that and

887
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:19,810
get in and all that fun stuff so outside

888
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:24,090
of the the leading edge of the providers

889
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:26,500
think about everything else we do right

890
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,110
telecom email banks financials utilities

891
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:31,990
postal shipping all of those are pretty

892
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:33,670
much the same as they were two decades

893
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:35,980
ago before the advent of the internet

894
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,780
you have to get a certificate of death

895
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,869
most of them we

896
00:37:39,869 --> 00:37:43,109
we'll change the ownership like as far

897
00:37:43,109 --> 00:37:44,730
as telecoms and in banks and financials

898
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:47,220
obviously that a lot of this comes with

899
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:50,160
with estate planning but we've changed

900
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,470
the way we interact with these companies

901
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,849
where we're interacting with them

902
00:37:53,849 --> 00:37:56,490
digitally so if you have to wait for a

903
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:58,319
certificate of death or you have to go

904
00:37:58,319 --> 00:38:00,869
and prove that you are the successor to

905
00:38:00,869 --> 00:38:03,450
an estate just know you can't access

906
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:06,029
these things in the same way that the

907
00:38:06,029 --> 00:38:08,730
person who was managing these were

908
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:10,769
before meaning they don't have any

909
00:38:10,769 --> 00:38:13,769
successor attributes or emergency access

910
00:38:13,769 --> 00:38:15,869
plans or ways around to help

911
00:38:15,869 --> 00:38:17,369
short-circuit that so if you don't know

912
00:38:17,369 --> 00:38:19,440
the password you can get access to their

913
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,329
password vault you don't have their

914
00:38:21,329 --> 00:38:23,579
fingerprints you're not getting into

915
00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:25,079
these things at least digitally until

916
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:27,059
you can provide a certificate of death

917
00:38:27,059 --> 00:38:28,650
and even then it usually has to be

918
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:30,690
transferred into your name credit checks

919
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:33,059
have to be done you have to wait for

920
00:38:33,059 --> 00:38:35,099
billing cycles and and and all that

921
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:38,190
stuff so again just try to prep you

922
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,230
maybe some things to think about when

923
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:43,049
you go home might be some some

924
00:38:43,049 --> 00:38:44,880
conversations you want to have and and

925
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,329
plan for these things so now what

926
00:38:48,329 --> 00:38:50,819
Kevin's given us a bunch of problems a

927
00:38:50,819 --> 00:38:53,999
bunch of what-ifs some have answers some

928
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:56,160
domme he talked to us for 20 minutes

929
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,930
about how authentication systems work

930
00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:00,059
well I do want to give you some

931
00:39:00,059 --> 00:39:01,980
solutions so there's a couple high tech

932
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,239
solutions there's a couple low tech

933
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:04,920
solutions and maybe a couple novel ones

934
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:09,869
thrown in there so high tech options if

935
00:39:09,869 --> 00:39:12,509
you're really savvy maybe you can come

936
00:39:12,509 --> 00:39:15,420
up with a distributed recovery system

937
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,880
where portions of your vault are backed

938
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,460
up to AWS and this one's to Azure and

939
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:23,579
you give you know pieces you the sky's

940
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:24,839
the limit you can come up with some

941
00:39:24,839 --> 00:39:26,700
really creative things the cool thing

942
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,710
about technology is there's ways that

943
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:32,220
you can distribute things like you never

944
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,559
had before right we never had the option

945
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:36,749
to do that before there's also this idea

946
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:39,599
of passwords sharding right shard means

947
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:43,079
to break up so you like give pieces of

948
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:47,249
your password or a key to certain people

949
00:39:47,249 --> 00:39:49,710
and hope they don't all come together

950
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:52,259
it's like the I'm not a Marvel guy but

951
00:39:52,259 --> 00:39:53,580
like the Infinity stones you hope

952
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,050
all come to the same place I think

953
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:57,060
that's is that good all right that's

954
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:59,970
good all right and you could use like

955
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:01,740
multi layer encryption schemes same kind

956
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:04,230
of idea right you encrypt something and

957
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:05,820
then you put an envelope around that

958
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,070
with a different key I don't know what

959
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:10,050
that cracking is envelope around that

960
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:11,550
with a different key and envelope around

961
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:13,440
that with an encrypting a different key

962
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,090
right you can just keep adding more and

963
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:16,980
more abstraction layers around it to

964
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,750
where hopefully you can shoestring

965
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,220
something together those are high-tech

966
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:24,810
options some low-tech options like lock

967
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:29,520
boxes right just go to the bank I showed

968
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,190
you that that QR code earlier and the QR

969
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:35,970
code is your secret for your totp e and

970
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:38,430
h OTP accounts well you know what I do

971
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:39,930
honest to goodness Tori I hope no one

972
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:42,090
robs me when I go home I print those

973
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:44,190
damn things off when I get in a QR code

974
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:47,250
I print that QR code out and I put it in

975
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:49,560
my safe you know what that allows me to

976
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:54,330
do when I get my new phone I just go to

977
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:57,270
all those QR codes I just scan each of

978
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:59,010
the QR codes and I add them right back

979
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:00,900
in I don't have to reset anything I

980
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,240
don't have to hope that I remember this

981
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,010
remember that I can just back them all

982
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:07,770
up and if something happens I can tell

983
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:10,230
my wife hey if you need the codes the

984
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:13,020
codes are in the safe just scan your

985
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,460
phone and now you have access to my

986
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:16,410
second factor you can do the same thing

987
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:22,500
with Fido keys you bikies but a lot of

988
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,390
sites don't have the ability to add

989
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:27,930
multiple keys yet it's increasing but

990
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:30,270
just know if you don't keep that key in

991
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:30,930
a safe place

992
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:34,620
a lot of sites don't have multiple key

993
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:38,640
adoption safe deposit boxes of course

994
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,200
just truck people you trust with

995
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,480
whatever the heck you trust them with

996
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,120
passwords or you know whatnot

997
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,340
you could use some like technology that

998
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:49,860
isn't easy to actually obtain anymore

999
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:52,380
like I don't know you know put your will

1000
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,120
or put your not your will put something

1001
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,400
sensitive on this medium and include

1002
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,500
that medium in the box with it and if

1003
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,910
someone finds it they're like I don't

1004
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:01,500
even know how this thing works and you

1005
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,360
give instructions in your estate

1006
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,490
planning on how they get this thing that

1007
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:07,020
sounds really convoluted I'm not gonna

1008
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,640
recommend that but it's something it's a

1009
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,520
low-tech option or high-tech I'm not

1010
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,460
sure or just bury the damn thing in the

1011
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:16,770
ground somewhere and leave where your

1012
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:22,500
passwords are um all of that said there

1013
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:26,790
is the fact that all of the technology

1014
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:30,110
that we've talked about has progressed

1015
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:32,220
fundamentally just in the last decade

1016
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:34,770
right so you're doing all this estate

1017
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:35,940
planning and you're planning your

1018
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:38,640
password sharding you're doing all this

1019
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,060
stuff whose just say that that mechanism

1020
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,640
is even going to be there tomorrow or

1021
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,130
the next day or the next week right or

1022
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:48,840
that you didn't get a new phone and you

1023
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:51,660
had it throw out your old H OTP code and

1024
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:56,340
do a new you know so unfortunately the

1025
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,380
glass blow point here it's just gonna

1026
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:00,510
get more complicated these are ideas

1027
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:01,950
that you should have on the top of your

1028
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:04,320
mind I don't have a silver bullet that's

1029
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,600
gonna solve all of your problems but I

1030
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,310
can't tell you how things work from a

1031
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:09,930
technical perspective if you come to me

1032
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:12,990
Kevin I don't get this I have this code

1033
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:15,240
and I have this key I can break down the

1034
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,740
nuts and bolts on how that work and if

1035
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:18,870
then you can take that and replicate a

1036
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:20,280
way that you can pass that along to

1037
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,990
friends or family or come up with an

1038
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:24,360
idea what you would do in a break the

1039
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,850
glass situation albeit and I'm happy to

1040
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:29,790
offer my time to do that right but you

1041
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:31,020
got to start thinking about this stuff

1042
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:32,550
because if you're not here tomorrow your

1043
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:34,590
significant others not here tomorrow and

1044
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:35,730
you got to get into your bank account

1045
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:38,250
you got to do this this stuff is really

1046
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:42,450
really you know imperative and you know

1047
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:44,610
an ounce of prevention really is worth a

1048
00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:46,260
pound of cure if you've ever had to deal

1049
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:49,080
with these cleanup situations where

1050
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,670
you're trying to put the pieces back

1051
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:53,730
together and there's just sitting on on

1052
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:55,770
hold and dealing with with social

1053
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:57,990
services and getting certificates and

1054
00:43:57,990 --> 00:44:00,300
proving you are who you are it's really

1055
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:01,770
really complicated so if you can cut

1056
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:03,720
even a portion of this off at the pass

1057
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,940
it's certainly well worth your time and

1058
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:09,270
our digital lives are just increasingly

1059
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:12,120
increasingly more dependent on these

1060
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:15,360
things so talk with your friends or

1061
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:19,190
family talk to a lawyer not a lawyer

1062
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:21,030
layer

1063
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:25,590
talk to a lawyer and start your plans

1064
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:28,980
for bequeathing I mean if you run your

1065
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:31,080
digital lives the way I know I run my

1066
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:33,240
digital life it's extremely important to

1067
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:36,030
at least broach that subject get some of

1068
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:37,770
your basis is covered and know what

1069
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:39,710
you're gonna do next

1070
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:44,190
one final plug before Q&A my buddy and

1071
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:45,990
co-worker John Callahan he's gonna be

1072
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:48,060
talking about crypto miners versus

1073
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:51,150
machine learning in the next track next

1074
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:53,100
door if you don't know what machine

1075
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:55,050
learning is you think it's some blackbox

1076
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:57,060
magic some vendors trying to shut sell

1077
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:59,520
you something please go to his talk he's

1078
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,990
gonna be talking about crypto miners

1079
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:03,420
because it's sexy and people are you

1080
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:07,350
know in Basel by what is a crypto minor

1081
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:09,330
but in reality he's gonna break out what

1082
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:12,930
machine learning is into words and and

1083
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:15,630
statements and nuance that I personally

1084
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:18,900
have never seen anyone do it's math it's

1085
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:20,910
basic math and he does a really good job

1086
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:22,830
of explaining it and he does it in a

1087
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:24,930
really cool way where he can find these

1088
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:27,120
crypto miners that are going up against

1089
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:30,570
these AWS instances and he pulls that

1090
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:32,640
data out of the flow log traffic so it's

1091
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,880
really cool anyway we'd open up for

1092
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:39,000
questions if you don't want to ask me

1093
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,190
here hit me up I'm at keV Cody on

1094
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:41,730
Twitter

1095
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:44,520
I'm Kevin Cody on LinkedIn I'm Kevin

1096
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:47,100
Cody on every other social platform

1097
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:49,440
I'm not keV Cody underscore on Instagram

1098
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,400
that's a rapper he wants keV Cody and I

1099
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,380
get a lot of his I actually I get

1100
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:59,480
contracts for it anyway question

1101
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:12,089
I am NOT a lawyer no so the question is

1102
00:46:12,089 --> 00:46:14,490
what's the legality of trying to use

1103
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:16,589
forensic software to recover data from

1104
00:46:16,589 --> 00:46:19,470
the deceased I would say that legality

1105
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:23,780
really depends on your your right to

1106
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:26,819
interact with the deceased assets right

1107
00:46:26,819 --> 00:46:29,579
so if you are the mailman you're

1108
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:31,410
probably not allowed to do that right

1109
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:34,260
now are they gonna come after you no but

1110
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:37,829
they're a state might so I that was a

1111
00:46:37,829 --> 00:46:39,030
really roundabout as a politician's

1112
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:40,140
answer but I hope that answered your

1113
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:42,259
question

1114
00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:52,050
any other questions yes sir so I gave

1115
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:56,670
you two four instances the the gmail one

1116
00:46:56,670 --> 00:47:00,359
and the Facebook one I'm sorry his

1117
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:01,530
question was what about other services

1118
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:07,020
there are there are some they most

1119
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:08,819
services will at least come out and tell

1120
00:47:08,819 --> 00:47:11,579
you if you have a deceased family member

1121
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:14,060
and you believe you have the rights to

1122
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:17,099
interact with the appropriate

1123
00:47:17,099 --> 00:47:19,050
documentation we will deactivate their

1124
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:22,740
account that's pretty much the extent of

1125
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:24,780
it there are very few service providers

1126
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:27,750
that you let you do other things as far

1127
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:30,180
as like getting access to their accounts

1128
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,770
and honestly if some if a service

1129
00:47:31,770 --> 00:47:34,200
provider is gonna reset your data or

1130
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:39,060
give someone post humorous no human

1131
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:41,130
access post there you go post mortem

1132
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:42,930
access to your data it's a little

1133
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:45,300
concerning and most of the big guys

1134
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:48,109
won't they'll just they'll give a

1135
00:47:48,109 --> 00:47:51,180
modified ability to do some actions

1136
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:53,450
others will just delete the account I

1137
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:55,710
did look up whatsapp just cuz I was

1138
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:57,420
interested whatsapp tells you if you

1139
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:58,980
have a deceased friend or family member

1140
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:01,319
open their phone select the Settings

1141
00:48:01,319 --> 00:48:03,150
button and click the delete account

1142
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:06,750
button I swear that's what their

1143
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:10,980
instructions are now that's an IM or SMS

1144
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:12,540
type app so it's a little different than

1145
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:14,099
like a social media but that's their

1146
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:15,030
instructions if you have a deceased

1147
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:17,630
member that's

1148
00:48:25,730 --> 00:48:30,870
so the question is getting getting

1149
00:48:30,870 --> 00:48:33,560
access to their digital logs and records

1150
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:36,930
from from the estate so so a lot of

1151
00:48:36,930 --> 00:48:38,880
companies will give you the especially

1152
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,830
with like the the different legislation

1153
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:42,630
will allow you to request your digital

1154
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:45,240
records chat logs and all that different

1155
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:46,860
stuff that's a good question I don't

1156
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:48,420
think they would release that outside of

1157
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:52,500
first party I think you can delete the

1158
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,500
account and you can remove most with it

1159
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,970
with the death certificate I don't think

1160
00:48:56,970 --> 00:48:58,170
like the it's not freedom of information

1161
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:01,320
but the ability to get your data back as

1162
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:03,510
a gdpr whatever it is that doesn't apply

1163
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:05,940
to estates I don't believe I haven't

1164
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:09,870
seen anything resembling that any other

1165
00:49:09,870 --> 00:49:12,450
questions thanks for coming listen to me

1166
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:15,000
about death I'm sorry but we got to talk

1167
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:15,930
about it right

1168
00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:20,969
