00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,129
already last but certainly not least so

2
00:00:09,129 --> 00:00:11,110
brett introduced fen laboum he'll be

3
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:13,449
presenting on transforming government

4
00:00:13,449 --> 00:00:16,360
compliance if Emily balm CISSP has been

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,010
involved with data security and personal

6
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:19,570
privacy for decades starting with this

7
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:22,779
1981 MIT thesis of an electronic

8
00:00:22,779 --> 00:00:24,429
newspaper that foresaw problems with

9
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:26,410
personalization if privacy was ignored

10
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,869
News bake today Fenn is the chief

11
00:00:28,869 --> 00:00:30,699
information security officer for civic

12
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:32,409
actions and is working to bring agile

13
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:34,150
free and open-source security to

14
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:36,330
government ages government agencies

15
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,620
federate antiquated static cyber

16
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,900
security compliance requirements fens

17
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,310
goal for this year is to an able general

18
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:44,230
purpose authority to operate otherwise

19
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:46,840
known as ATO authorizations in two weeks

20
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,550
we're currently this process takes

21
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:50,500
agencies from nine months to three years

22
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:57,730
please welcome Fenn wow that's great he

23
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:59,380
just gave half my talk I forgot that

24
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,690
those were all in the introduction so we

25
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:06,240
can all go home now so basically with

26
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,380
transforming government compliance is

27
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,939
something that actually transforming

28
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:10,869
government is something I'm very

29
00:01:10,869 --> 00:01:13,390
interested into and transforming

30
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:15,850
government compliance is something that

31
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,460
we need to do watching a lot of these

32
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,969
talks industry private sector compliance

33
00:01:21,969 --> 00:01:24,159
is way ahead of government government is

34
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,109
still good a bunch of checkboxes and so

35
00:01:26,109 --> 00:01:28,719
I'm gonna give some background on that

36
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:31,929
and then talk a little bit about what

37
00:01:31,929 --> 00:01:33,039
we're doing to try to make the process

38
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:37,600
more automated so yeah I just gave the

39
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,639
table of contents how we got here

40
00:01:39,639 --> 00:01:41,649
what is civic actions the company I work

41
00:01:41,649 --> 00:01:44,499
for what is compliance and endpoint

42
00:01:44,499 --> 00:01:46,030
security is improving we're seeing that

43
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,979
I'm really happy to say and then the

44
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:50,700
automated SSP creation and next steps

45
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,959
I've always had interested in in

46
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:55,630
security even before that the thesis I

47
00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:00,219
met Ron Rivest Shamir the RNA from R&S

48
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:03,939
from RSA back when they were introducing

49
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:07,569
public key cryptography and wrote my

50
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:10,030
thesis on personalized social media with

51
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:14,040
privacy was a get involved with the e FF

52
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,200
was a founding member the cypherpunks

53
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,130
did a lot of things with p3

54
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,560
platform for privacy preferences with

55
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,670
the w3c and a bunch of other bunch of

56
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:27,610
other things over a bunch of years but

57
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:28,960
then I get involved with civic actions

58
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,210
civic actions is working at working to

59
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,740
try to make the grave greater good for

60
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:36,430
the first 10 years we were working at

61
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,560
empowering people at the edges working

62
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,860
at making nonprofits that made that we

63
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,040
liked work better we were founded in

64
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,230
Berkeley we are a hundred percent remote

65
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,670
we're also at represents free and

66
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,790
open-source software our first clients

67
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,200
were people like Amnesty International

68
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,750
and Greenpeace and then in 2014 we

69
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,550
decided let's let's think about

70
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,740
transforming government and see if we

71
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,620
can take government and make it work

72
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,630
better for people make better products

73
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:11,800
for them and help them do things that we

74
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,160
all would like government to do it's

75
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,110
interesting transferring from Amnesty

76
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,700
International to our first client which

77
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,280
was the DoD but it was a DSCA which is a

78
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,100
defense security cooperation agency if

79
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,500
there is a Department of Peace in the in

80
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,030
the Department of Defense it's probably

81
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,800
this group they they measure their

82
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,710
successes by conflict conflicts avoided

83
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:37,090
and we grew from 35 to 75 people since

84
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,100
we did that we've got a bunch of clients

85
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,480
now some of the clients that I'm

86
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,370
involved with are DSC a Department of

87
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:49,320
Education Health and Human Services NSF

88
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:54,340
also Veterans Affairs and the GSA is our

89
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,700
newest client so if federal compliance

90
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:02,020
origins I'm going again briefly go over

91
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,550
this so you can save some time at the

92
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,370
end for talking about where we're going

93
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,530
it's kind of started in 2002 when the

94
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:09,760
government realized that their systems

95
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,960
were getting hacked into and FISMA

96
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,790
became law the federal Information

97
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:15,220
Security Management Act and that was the

98
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,839
first time that they actually codified

99
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,120
or not maybe no the first time but the

100
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,240
time that it became a law that people

101
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,680
actually had to make systems that were

102
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,050
met a certain amount of compliance and

103
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:29,020
they set the bar with pretty high at the

104
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,259
time

105
00:04:30,259 --> 00:04:33,680
with approximately 300 security controls

106
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,139
and you had to actually your show that

107
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:38,569
your system meets these with checking

108
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:41,090
boxes and then they would grant you a

109
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:43,699
authority to operate which would say

110
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:45,259
that your system is now secure for the

111
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:49,129
next three years this was in 2002 not

112
00:04:49,129 --> 00:04:50,659
much has changed since then

113
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:53,810
which is really kind of scary there has

114
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,110
been a lot of things that I cap came out

115
00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:00,409
the 837 which the risk management

116
00:05:00,409 --> 00:05:01,879
framework really changed the way that

117
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:04,180
those 300 controls were set up

118
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,379
continuous monitoring was introduced in

119
00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:08,689
2011 and the Department of Homeland

120
00:05:08,689 --> 00:05:11,080
Security brought up the concept of

121
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,129
continuous diagnostics and mitigation

122
00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:14,210
but a lot of people consider that

123
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,219
continuous they think the CNM stands for

124
00:05:16,219 --> 00:05:18,889
continuous monitoring that's it's a good

125
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:21,409
thing except for the fact that the

126
00:05:21,409 --> 00:05:25,189
control basically puts H BSS and and a

127
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:28,129
caste systems into your system is

128
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:30,289
designed for Windows these are McAfee

129
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:33,589
agents that go into your system we're

130
00:05:33,589 --> 00:05:37,250
all open-source so we're running Red Hat

131
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:41,270
Linux in Ubuntu and so these have to get

132
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,370
kind of put into our system is the only

133
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,289
software that I can't look at and see

134
00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:47,419
what's going on the last speaker just

135
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:49,819
said that the the EPO a policy

136
00:05:49,819 --> 00:05:51,469
Orchestrator that pushes the software

137
00:05:51,469 --> 00:05:53,719
down actually has been used to push

138
00:05:53,719 --> 00:05:57,789
malware this is one of my fears

139
00:05:57,969 --> 00:06:00,949
basically what we need is we need to

140
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:03,409
open open for any kind of continuous

141
00:06:03,409 --> 00:06:04,909
monitoring system there should be open

142
00:06:04,909 --> 00:06:08,060
protocols and open data formats anything

143
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,009
anything less if it's if it's completely

144
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:12,439
closed you can't trust it there should

145
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:14,149
be referenced applications on github

146
00:06:14,149 --> 00:06:17,139
that you can see and modify and change

147
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:20,089
that's just just the beginning and

148
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:21,800
actually we are working on where I'm

149
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,960
actually working with a DHS I can't

150
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,860
believe I'm working with the Department

151
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,719
of Homeland Security I'm working with a

152
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,610
DHS to try to make some of these changes

153
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:31,219
because they're realizing that these

154
00:06:31,219 --> 00:06:32,749
systems do need to be open the next

155
00:06:32,749 --> 00:06:35,089
versions of there's security asset

156
00:06:35,089 --> 00:06:36,469
management systems are going to have an

157
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:38,330
API also so that we can actually write

158
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:43,880
into them FISMA Modernization came

159
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:48,410
modernize anything the dye cap decided

160
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:49,190
it's gonna start using the risk

161
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:52,250
management framework and 853 you may

162
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,480
have heard of it this is the version

163
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,980
that came out that really became the

164
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,480
Bible of everyone doing government

165
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,530
compliance I know this 853 way too well

166
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:05,630
right now so what is this compliance and

167
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:08,810
when we started doing government work we

168
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:11,000
needed to see so and I was the last

169
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,850
person to take a step backwards and I

170
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:17,480
jumped into the role I I wrote one of

171
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,980
the first things I did was write an SSP

172
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:24,170
system security plan for the for the

173
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:28,910
DSCA and it was a 400-page Word document

174
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:31,460
that's what they wanted I tried to give

175
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,990
them code I tried to get them to look at

176
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,990
get they wouldn't look at it it was a

177
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,450
book of monsters and not only was it a

178
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:41,000
book of monsters but it's based on the

179
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,590
RMF witch but besides the 853 all the

180
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,590
documents that points to i'm trying to

181
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:50,620
Ameri know the name of the man who

182
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,730
actually counted the pages but it's

183
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:55,940
about 6,000 pages of compliance

184
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,910
documentation so nobody even reads

185
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:01,700
nobody reads the the SSP and nobody

186
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,140
reads the documentation that goes into

187
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:07,370
it so I learned one thing I did learn as

188
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:10,070
compliance is not security and probably

189
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,710
a lot of you know this so the government

190
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:13,970
actually began figuring it out started

191
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,500
updating risk management they've done

192
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:23,720
some good work the OMB circular a-133 53

193
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,220
I don't think but it was the first place

194
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,330
that really mentioned ongoing

195
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,130
authorization they don't want the

196
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,050
authorization be one time every three

197
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,679
years but they wanted to be continuously

198
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:36,280
checked and they also mentioned

199
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,750
interoperability among tools and I

200
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,979
obviously did not have interoperability

201
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:42,320
among tools because it fell off the back

202
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,780
when I when I exported this presentation

203
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,790
but we use some of the tools we use are

204
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,360
things like open s cap

205
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:58,809
docker chef in-spec ansible there's a

206
00:08:58,809 --> 00:09:00,279
lot of open source tools that can be

207
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:02,499
used as a baseline for getting started

208
00:09:02,499 --> 00:09:07,119
also open control is which I'll talk

209
00:09:07,119 --> 00:09:09,129
about in a few moments then this

210
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:11,350
cybersecurity framework is something

211
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,449
that works inside the public in the

212
00:09:13,449 --> 00:09:15,670
private sector if you don't know about

213
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,170
this yeah it's been talked about for

214
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:18,910
several talks bring it up

215
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:22,029
it's very extremely good it's really

216
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:24,579
well written language CEOs can read it

217
00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:26,649
and understand it I recommend you ask

218
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,139
your CEO to read it and it's something

219
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:30,730
that can be done with completely without

220
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,769
government intervention you can do it

221
00:09:32,769 --> 00:09:35,319
yourself and it's a really really good

222
00:09:35,319 --> 00:09:37,360
set of commands also as was mentioned

223
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,549
the CIS security framework benchmarks

224
00:09:39,549 --> 00:09:44,920
are really good and the RMF v2 just in

225
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,110
december the version 2 of the RMF came

226
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:50,319
out and that is also aiming more towards

227
00:09:50,319 --> 00:09:52,059
the public sector it's taken out the

228
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:55,029
word federal it's mentioning it's

229
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:59,619
emphasizing privacy more and and also

230
00:09:59,619 --> 00:10:00,669
bringing up the concept of the

231
00:10:00,669 --> 00:10:03,100
information lifecycle really realizing

232
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:03,730
that they're going to look at

233
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,199
information from the time it's created

234
00:10:05,199 --> 00:10:07,929
to destruction the entire the entire

235
00:10:07,929 --> 00:10:12,850
lifecycle of information so I'm really

236
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:16,360
hat so as any security researcher knows

237
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,399
endpoint security is improving if you

238
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,899
remember to change their passwords from

239
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:24,429
admin admin but it's there's still a lot

240
00:10:24,429 --> 00:10:26,439
of work to do because of the way you

241
00:10:26,439 --> 00:10:28,269
tell the government that you're actually

242
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:31,540
secure is by using these three hundred

243
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:35,139
four hundred page word documents also

244
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:36,879
cyber security scope is rapidly

245
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:40,089
increasing the systems are virtualizing

246
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:43,839
and moving to the cloud so the cyber

247
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,429
security framework is moving into the

248
00:10:45,429 --> 00:10:47,169
boardroom the gdpr

249
00:10:47,169 --> 00:10:51,220
which demands has a lot of changes both

250
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:54,160
of gdpr and the CCPA are both bringing

251
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,660
up a lot of privacy requirements for for

252
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:01,360
users to make sure how that people know

253
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,009
how their information is being used and

254
00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:03,779
collected

255
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:11,420
very important stuff what's going on is

256
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:15,930
well in in user interface design people

257
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:18,029
understand responsive design they

258
00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:19,949
realize that you have to build a system

259
00:11:19,949 --> 00:11:23,759
that works for every kind of platform

260
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:27,060
what we also need is responsive security

261
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,699
and agile security mechanisms and the

262
00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:31,019
government doesn't really get that they

263
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:34,189
still have our stuck in a one size fits

264
00:11:34,189 --> 00:11:38,459
fits all so what the work that we're

265
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:40,379
working on is automating system security

266
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:43,980
plan this is sort of a back-end but

267
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,959
we're actually having hooks into the

268
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:48,029
front-end of actually hooking into the

269
00:11:48,029 --> 00:11:50,910
CI CD pipelines shifting left the

270
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:54,029
process of security into the developers

271
00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:55,769
area so that when the developers make

272
00:11:55,769 --> 00:11:57,420
changes they can help make changes that

273
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,029
will feed through and into the security

274
00:12:00,029 --> 00:12:02,269
plan wrong direction

275
00:12:02,269 --> 00:12:06,600
so it starts with machine readable files

276
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,689
that we store and get they're called

277
00:12:09,689 --> 00:12:12,809
open control open control looks like

278
00:12:12,809 --> 00:12:16,649
this I don't think I have a pointer but

279
00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:20,069
what we see here is this is the risk

280
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:23,250
assessment family risk assessment number

281
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:28,529
one which is a policy we see that it's

282
00:12:28,529 --> 00:12:32,430
from the standard key mist 853 and as a

283
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,050
text underneath the department follows

284
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:35,670
risk assessment policy and procedures

285
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:41,069
formally documented this is machine

286
00:12:41,069 --> 00:12:44,939
readable code for a policy one like this

287
00:12:44,939 --> 00:12:46,170
it'll probably be written by a person

288
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:48,899
and not written by the computer but when

289
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:50,699
it is but it can also be turned into

290
00:12:50,699 --> 00:12:53,339
using an editor like hyper GRC which is

291
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:57,779
a free system on available online you

292
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:00,420
can see on the left it has the actual

293
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,269
guidance from 853 then it has the

294
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:05,279
controls the controls are the control

295
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,550
for risk assessment number one has three

296
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,620
parts to it part part of it comes from

297
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,809
AWS it's system partially inherits it

298
00:13:12,809 --> 00:13:14,970
part of it comes from Civic actions

299
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:17,260
the contractor working on it

300
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,210
part of it comes from links the client

301
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,130
and you can actually see the department

302
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,600
follows the risk assessment policy and

303
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,540
procedures coming directly from the from

304
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:31,290
the mo we also want reusable components

305
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:34,240
because when you build something if you

306
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,410
build something on AWS

307
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,270
you're probably gonna if you have five

308
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,860
systems in AWS they're all going to

309
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,300
inherit the same things from AWS you

310
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,800
shouldn't have to write the same section

311
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,410
of code the same section of your system

312
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:46,920
security plan over and over again so

313
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,980
when we did the system security plan for

314
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,980
this client we created five major

315
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,490
components one for AWS one for Civic

316
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:59,290
actions one for Drupal one for the

317
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:01,810
organization and one for the privacy

318
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:05,800
overlay these each one of these right

319
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,780
now is static but we're currently in the

320
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,780
process of make template izing them so

321
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,040
that we can push them out and put them

322
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,390
on github and make them available to

323
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:18,910
anyone this is just a quick look at the

324
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:24,040
AWS component you can see a c-1 AWS if I

325
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,080
click this is not live unfortunately but

326
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,530
an AC one this is something that's

327
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,660
partially inherited a c2 is also

328
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:34,390
partially inherited but for the Drupal

329
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:37,030
component a c1 is not involved because

330
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:39,370
the policy this is not part of Drupal

331
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,800
but Drupal does actually define very

332
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,740
clearly very specifically Part A Part D

333
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:51,460
and part G of account management by the

334
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,260
way I'm realizing talking really fast

335
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,790
and if anyone ever asked any questions

336
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:57,839
at any point please feel free

337
00:15:01,029 --> 00:15:06,339
so we've got these llamo files and the

338
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:10,300
next step what we want to do is do

339
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:14,110
automated evidence collection when an

340
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,910
authorizing official from the government

341
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:18,490
wants to see or see or as system

342
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:19,720
security plan what they want to do is

343
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,010
they want to see evidence and the

344
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:23,640
evidence in the past has been

345
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:28,839
screenshots take a screenshot it's crazy

346
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:30,730
they take a screenshot of the page

347
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,740
showing the configuration of a system

348
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,990
and they're happy that's what I use them

349
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:39,700
that first SSP well here's an example

350
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,610
for if the password must be at least 14

351
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,580
characters maybe needs to be more

352
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,720
actually this has just changed where now

353
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,050
this client needs 16 characters the

354
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,610
evidence at the bottom says attach

355
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:54,850
evidence right now we're manually

356
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,350
attaching the evidence but we're

357
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:59,440
building a building the back end so so

358
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,760
we can have scripts that go out check

359
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,250
the could check the configurations see

360
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,860
that it's looking at 16 characters pull

361
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,320
it in and then we can verify that over

362
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,209
against the baseline and get you know

363
00:16:10,209 --> 00:16:11,800
pop up a green light that we're meeting

364
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,430
this control or pop it but red light if

365
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:21,940
we're not meeting the control this is

366
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:25,600
this this page just shows we can also do

367
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,490
dips between controls and there are a

368
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:32,440
five part a in the middle you can see

369
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,959
AWS does not contribute to that but

370
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:40,180
actively Acquia ace built an AWS does so

371
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,890
we can take take any two sets of

372
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,810
components and and do a diff between

373
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:45,070
them if we have time afterwards I can

374
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,270
actually I can actually show some of

375
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:48,720
this working

376
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:52,860
we want sharing of control information

377
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,269
will be putting ours out in both open

378
00:16:55,269 --> 00:16:58,779
control and an auth Cal format on our on

379
00:16:58,779 --> 00:17:01,449
our github site I was hoping to have it

380
00:17:01,449 --> 00:17:03,790
done by today or out there by today

381
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:07,059
you know the week make so defined that

382
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:10,209
week is probably three weeks but but

383
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:14,439
it'll it'll be out there soon so it'll

384
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:16,390
be out an open control format which open

385
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:18,010
control was started I if I didn't

386
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:20,289
mention it before it was found it was

387
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,199
created by pivotal and 18f and now

388
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,020
there's a small group of very excited

389
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:28,179
people working on it but there's also

390
00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:30,520
this group called us calc coming from

391
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:35,830
NIST and this is it's it's hard to say

392
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,570
but there's a lot of overlap between us

393
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:40,179
Cal and open control it's where the open

394
00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:41,559
control committees a little dismayed

395
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:44,110
that a scowl people didn't come to us

396
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:46,750
and say what are you doing how can we

397
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,309
extend it and they just started their

398
00:17:48,309 --> 00:17:52,030
own thing but it's a scale looks really

399
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:57,130
good and I think I have an example some

400
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,929
other made document creation with both

401
00:17:58,929 --> 00:18:01,600
this is this is a document created from

402
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,240
our open control this is actually our a5

403
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,799
of vulnerability scanning which again

404
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:11,049
has the at the top the the guidance and

405
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:12,940
underneath the AWS component and a links

406
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:16,120
component one of the great things that

407
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,210
you can do with with markdown

408
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:23,500
fortunately is there's a great there's a

409
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:27,429
great script called the PMBOK that will

410
00:18:27,429 --> 00:18:32,110
turn this turn this into Microsoft Word

411
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:34,600
and that's again before you upload it

412
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,789
before you give it to the AOS they want

413
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:41,020
Microsoft Word for what we're

414
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,090
experimenting with ah scowl as loss

415
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:45,309
scale as a format for keeping track of

416
00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:47,200
the information for what's called the

417
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,330
front matter the front matter is the

418
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:50,800
introduction

419
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,610
the system name the points of contact

420
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:57,370
there the system description the

421
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,340
technical description rule federal rules

422
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,380
and regulations there's about 13 things

423
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,030
I'm only showing one two and nine here

424
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,620
because that's as far as we've gotten so

425
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:08,860
far but the format that austell has

426
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:12,700
these in is in llamo and so this with

427
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,310
this yamo file that we got from the AA

428
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:18,910
scale community we created this we

429
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:21,400
created a document which has a template

430
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,680
for taking that oskol if you see in this

431
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,550
template actually let me go back we can

432
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:30,040
see at the top there's system name data

433
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:33,120
data.gov multi-tenant system and

434
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,730
description underneath with base lo and

435
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:42,280
selected lo these go into the goes into

436
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,530
the template and we get up near the top

437
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:50,430
you can see this the system name I think

438
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:55,180
and you can see the the information the

439
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,220
information types with the general

440
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,750
services administration and the

441
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,370
confidentiality confidentiality

442
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:03,220
integrity and availability lo so we're

443
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:06,430
actually hoping to be able to take men

444
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:09,520
to be able to manage multiple systems

445
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,230
with us this one template and different

446
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:17,950
llamo files coming in based trying to

447
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,700
cut the time from a year to two weeks

448
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,350
and I think I think we might get our

449
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:25,240
first two weeks down we might get there

450
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,670
this year my next one I think is gonna

451
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:30,630
take about four weeks

452
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:35,800
so basically security demands agility we

453
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:41,530
need we need to not use just pure

454
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:43,260
compliant systems that exist right now

455
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:49,810
but use systems that our machine

456
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:51,190
readable can be written and write

457
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,830
written written read by the machines can

458
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:56,080
connect with the developers so the

459
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,210
developers can

460
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:00,310
as they make changes they can see that

461
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:02,620
their change is going to break we're

462
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:05,380
very used to QA and the CIC D pipeline

463
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,690
you need to move security and the CIO CD

464
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:08,530
pipeline

465
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:10,540
it's part of what part of the part of

466
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:14,350
the next steps and boy I believe I felt

467
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:17,410
like I was late and so I went fast but

468
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:20,340
that's it that's written for this talk I

469
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,900
could I would I can show a little bit of

470
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:27,480
a hyper GRC I think yes

471
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:49,970
yes the question is the question is in

472
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:54,890
NIST documentation in the 853 there's a

473
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:57,500
lot of places says say things like the

474
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,870
password length must be by by

475
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:01,430
organization Delta and then it has

476
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:03,230
square brackets organizational defined

477
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:06,410
amounts or things have to be checked by

478
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:10,340
organizational amount times those values

479
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:13,190
will all be in the ammo files and so

480
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,960
that will pull this from the mo file and

481
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,280
feed them into the templates and create

482
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,790
documentation

483
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:00,120
absolutely absolutely the question is

484
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,010
when we're working on this if we see

485
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:03,590
that a control doesn't really make sense

486
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:07,049
are we trying to take a look at that

487
00:23:07,049 --> 00:23:09,480
control and change it all so the thing

488
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,610
is that if there's a control if there's

489
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:17,039
a new threat that exists that's not in

490
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,490
the control system at all

491
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:23,490
none of our none of our federal clients

492
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:24,419
care about that

493
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:28,440
because it's not in a check box we are

494
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,380
looking at creating a community online

495
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,539
in github where people are making

496
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:34,919
changes and updating these things

497
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:38,580
regularly our context of the DoD are now

498
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,200
interested in hearing about this and

499
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,929
they're seeing a demo in two weeks and

500
00:23:41,929 --> 00:23:44,669
and so and and they're gonna have some

501
00:23:44,669 --> 00:23:46,320
people from the DHS there and that's

502
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,909
really who has to be there because the

503
00:23:47,909 --> 00:23:49,919
Department of Homeland Security is going

504
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,710
to be the ones that push it down problem

505
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:54,270
is is that there's a big cultural change

506
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:58,230
too and right now there is the law and

507
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:01,380
the law is bhisma and until that law

508
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,840
gets changed it's really probably going

509
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,500
to have to come from the president and

510
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,760
I'm not sure that's going to happen

511
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,970
anytime soon but we are making inroads

512
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:15,299
with the DoD and with DHS and I think

513
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:17,580
that's and and the Department of

514
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:20,029
Education listens they've been following

515
00:24:20,029 --> 00:24:23,640
what's going on so those those things

516
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,740
may start trickling down and I think

517
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,570
it's going to have I think I'll start

518
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:29,909
seeing things this year but it won't

519
00:24:29,909 --> 00:24:31,500
probably actually trickle down for a

520
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,289
couple years because we've got a lot of

521
00:24:34,289 --> 00:24:38,779
a lot of cultural changes to make

522
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:46,720
you see if I can see if I'm gonna see if

523
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:56,050
I can bring up GRC now this this is

524
00:24:56,050 --> 00:25:01,510
hyper GRC take this off this is hyper

525
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:07,260
GRC I've got a bunch of different things

526
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:10,090
in here right now I'm an open shift

527
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:13,510
platform Fredonia is something you can

528
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:16,900
download from open control the prime of

529
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,360
Education Health and Human Services

530
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:22,300
examples one of the better let me know

531
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,230
let me go to the General Services

532
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:30,310
Administration one here if this is this

533
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,140
this is a lot of this is already on

534
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:40,900
github so if we look at coming to pass

535
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,020
while actually this in passwords but

536
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:48,540
control implementation well you can see

537
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:51,370
this is exactly what you were talking

538
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:53,820
about over here

539
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:59,770
organizational defined auditable events

540
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:04,560
and then the organization defines the

541
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,290
audible events or failed login attempts

542
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:11,620
sort successful login attempts etc these

543
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,420
aren't defined by the organization here

544
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,910
that defined by see can the app but

545
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,980
we're actually because of that thinking

546
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,540
of moving this to the organization

547
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:28,020
section the code for this

548
00:26:35,129 --> 00:26:37,599
it's what's what's nice is this is

549
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:38,799
starting to come together where I can

550
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,989
actually use it and I was hoping to

551
00:26:40,989 --> 00:26:42,729
actually have a more full-fledged demo

552
00:26:42,729 --> 00:26:47,129
for this but next year

553
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,690
and that that I think is the austell

554
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:12,060
framework the nested miss is pushing

555
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:25,200
yeah and we in true DevOps fashion we

556
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,820
don't like the documentation as much as

557
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,760
we like the code and so we're actually

558
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,120
trying to we're using the code that

559
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,700
comes out of a skel and we're making our

560
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,650
code work with both a scale and open

561
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:49,430
control I'll look it up

562
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:53,790
now it's automation control for security

563
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:56,690
control assessments

564
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:02,730
well thank you

565
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:06,650
[Applause]
