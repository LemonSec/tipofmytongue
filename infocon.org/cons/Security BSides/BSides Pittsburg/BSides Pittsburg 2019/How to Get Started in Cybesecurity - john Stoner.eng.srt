1
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:07,090
it's getting started in cybersecurity by

2
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,670
mr. John stoner and I'll let him go

3
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:13,299
ahead do his introduction here and yeah

4
00:00:13,299 --> 00:00:20,020
let's give him our attention all right

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,450
hopefully everybody can hear me so

6
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,430
you're here cuz you're either in

7
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:25,870
cybersecurity and that other truck is

8
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:27,490
full or you want to be in cybersecurity

9
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:31,300
so thanks for coming to my talk today so

10
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,680
here's my legal disclaimer I starter

11
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,329
include that so I'm only here

12
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:36,399
representing myself not anybody else not

13
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,030
my employer so I will real briefly talk

14
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,499
about this but it seems really weird to

15
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:43,210
spend much time on this I have about 18

16
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,920
years of experience in national security

17
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,230
and Intel I have all the different

18
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:48,909
certifications that you can get unless

19
00:00:48,909 --> 00:00:51,339
you really want to stand sir I actually

20
00:00:51,339 --> 00:00:53,409
have my first sans class next month so

21
00:00:53,409 --> 00:00:56,289
that's exciting and I really like soccer

22
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:58,329
as well I secretly joined the army and

23
00:00:58,329 --> 00:00:59,260
got married I don't necessarily

24
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,210
recommend any of those options to

25
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:05,290
anybody all right so to get started

26
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:08,320
cyber security when I'm entering some

27
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,880
people which I was actually just doing

28
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,799
before because it was even cynical not

29
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:13,869
to do that and then present this and

30
00:01:13,869 --> 00:01:15,240
tell people they should get a mentor

31
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,259
people say I want to do something in

32
00:01:17,259 --> 00:01:19,030
cyber security awesome that really

33
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:22,630
doesn't tell your mentor what you want

34
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:24,549
to do in cyber security enough to maybe

35
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:27,039
give you proper advice right that's

36
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:28,450
essentially saying I want to work in the

37
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:31,479
medical field okay well I could use more

38
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:33,189
to go on so that's why I start off with

39
00:01:33,189 --> 00:01:36,100
this particular explanation here so

40
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,829
there's a lot of different roles in just

41
00:01:38,829 --> 00:01:40,659
IT and there's a lot of different roles

42
00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:43,000
just in cybersecurity so when you're

43
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,789
first starting out if you don't have an

44
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:48,369
IT background that's gonna be critical

45
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:50,350
is to get that underlying IT fundamental

46
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,840
background if you do have you know some

47
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,479
of the basics in IT already then you

48
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:57,159
really should start to narrow down your

49
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:59,770
search a little bit into what it is that

50
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,749
you want to study or what it is that you

51
00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:03,429
think you want to study in cybersecurity

52
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:06,579
there's gonna be some underlying themes

53
00:02:06,579 --> 00:02:10,389
in IT and cybersecurity they most people

54
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:12,040
will generally have some baseline

55
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,290
knowledge about but it can start to get

56
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:15,610
pretty divergent in cybersecurity

57
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,370
depending on what it is

58
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,319
typically you're interested in studying

59
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,450
in cybersecurity and there's there's

60
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,280
room for all of you in cybersecurity

61
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,500
there's lots of different roles that we

62
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,180
need in cybersecurity there's lots of

63
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,470
jobs that are going unfilled in

64
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,540
cybersecurity so I just kind of I like

65
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,760
to start with this to sort of in case

66
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,409
you have conversations later with your

67
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:36,180
friends or colleagues or other mentors

68
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,090
it helps us give you more specific

69
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,489
information if you know for sure you

70
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:43,379
know what forensic sounds interesting or

71
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:47,489
or something like that so if you haven't

72
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:49,379
really thought about that aspect yet I

73
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:50,879
point people back to the NIST the

74
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,109
National Institute of Standards and

75
00:02:52,109 --> 00:02:52,769
Technology

76
00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:56,190
they have 52 very well-defined

77
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,349
cybersecurity roles they break out all

78
00:02:58,349 --> 00:02:59,849
the knowledge skills and abilities or

79
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:01,829
KSA's for all of those fifty-two roles

80
00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:03,599
so if you're not even sure where to

81
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,170
start

82
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:05,940
you don't even know where to go to to

83
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,829
see what in cybersecurity you might

84
00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:10,620
possibly be interested in then I highly

85
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,720
recommend taking a look at that and even

86
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,519
though they have 52 they don't have all

87
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:17,010
of them right so even that in and of

88
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:19,230
itself does not encompass every possible

89
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:21,120
role that we have in the cybersecurity

90
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,530
field so pen testers are not

91
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,060
specifically called out in there

92
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,099
they have exploitation analysts it's a

93
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:30,750
little bit of a military flavour to a

94
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,549
pen tester there's not too many

95
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:34,230
companies that hire particularly for

96
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,690
that field they don't call it that job

97
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:39,180
name and they really don't have cyber

98
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,680
threat intelligence called out which

99
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,450
just offends me and everybody else who

100
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,829
specifically does cyber threat

101
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:46,349
intelligence but it will at least give

102
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:48,720
you a starting point to look at the

103
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,459
types of fields and look at the

104
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:52,349
knowledge skills and abilities that are

105
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:55,079
generally required for entry-level or

106
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:56,790
intermediate levels for those types of

107
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,069
cybersecurity job roles so I think that

108
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:00,269
that's a really good resource if you

109
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:02,310
haven't used that before and again this

110
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,010
is to sort of help you scope down what

111
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,810
it is you're interested in studying in

112
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,879
cybersecurity you can also kind of think

113
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,379
of it like starting to pick a major when

114
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:12,120
you go to school right you can't study

115
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,489
every single thing so there's lots of

116
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:16,589
different analogies I use to explain why

117
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,720
this is helpful when you ask for

118
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,418
specific advice about getting a job or

119
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:22,860
studying so that you can get a

120
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,930
particular job in the cybersecurity

121
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,080
discipline so also if you have questions

122
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,030
throughout the presentation let me know

123
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,080
and I

124
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,280
we'll have time at the end for questions

125
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:38,189
so a lot of people have some hesitation

126
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:40,199
just getting started there's some

127
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:43,110
initial maybe fear or a lack of

128
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,180
confidence to even start studying on

129
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,419
their own so some of that I believe is

130
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:50,039
because people haven't scoped down what

131
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,229
they want to study and that in and of

132
00:04:52,229 --> 00:04:53,969
itself is then intimidating because

133
00:04:53,969 --> 00:04:55,500
you're trying to study everything in

134
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,110
cybersecurity which is if you want to

135
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,550
have a normal life I don't recommend

136
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,460
that so there are some underlying things

137
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,840
that are probably going to be pretty

138
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,300
beneficial you need to have that IT

139
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,580
background you need to understand some

140
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,879
basic cybersecurity underpinnings as

141
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:14,250
well for most job fields in

142
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,580
cybersecurity and I also want to make

143
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,620
sure that you're studying something that

144
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,479
you like I would never recommend

145
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:23,159
somebody study something they don't like

146
00:05:23,159 --> 00:05:25,919
that's not a good life decision I am not

147
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,719
good at programming thank God for Google

148
00:05:27,719 --> 00:05:29,969
I passed that class I'm not a programmer

149
00:05:29,969 --> 00:05:31,889
I'm not a script er I have still been

150
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:33,509
able to work as a cyber threat

151
00:05:33,509 --> 00:05:35,819
intelligence analyst I'm also not good

152
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:37,979
at learning second languages so I have

153
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:39,719
chosen not to try to learn more second

154
00:05:39,719 --> 00:05:41,250
languages it didn't work out for me so

155
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,440
that's just some general sort of career

156
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,840
mentorship advice find the thing that

157
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,819
you're interested in and then you can

158
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:49,169
sort of start to shave what you're

159
00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:50,909
studying around things that you find

160
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:55,830
interesting a lot of people have will

161
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,270
come up and say I want to be a pen

162
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,400
tester I want to be a red teamer that's

163
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,319
pretty cool I want to look like the rock

164
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:04,529
there's a lot of work I have to do for

165
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:07,020
that to happen may or may not be very

166
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,449
realistic but it's a but this is not

167
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:11,460
something you're like I want to start

168
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,050
learning about cybersecurity so I can be

169
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,789
a pen tester in six months because if

170
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:16,650
you guys have curriculum that does that

171
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:20,089
you will be the next multi-millionaire

172
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:22,409
becoming a penetration tester is a

173
00:06:22,409 --> 00:06:25,229
really lengthy process so I'm not saying

174
00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:27,839
that shouldn't be your goal but that's a

175
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,699
lengthy goal that requires a lot of

176
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:32,120
expertise that's developed over a really

177
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,610
generally a number of years so I will

178
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:36,870
always tell people you should look at

179
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,550
monitor ability testing or vulnerability

180
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,500
assessments is a more natural path to

181
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,110
gain expertise that will then help you

182
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,139
get that first

183
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:47,439
type of a role so that's one little

184
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:49,030
rabbit hole and we can talk about that

185
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:52,030
as much as you guys want you know some

186
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:53,229
people are really interested in pcaps

187
00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:56,289
log analysis or you might really be

188
00:06:56,289 --> 00:06:58,060
interested in forensics there there's

189
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,110
lots of different things you can

190
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:01,030
consider to particularly

191
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:03,819
narrow down the scope of to study and

192
00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:05,379
get some skills applicable to a

193
00:07:05,379 --> 00:07:09,639
particular job field so how else can you

194
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:10,840
get started well there's lots of free

195
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,159
stuff hopefully you guys will be able

196
00:07:12,159 --> 00:07:14,500
get my slides I link to a lot of free

197
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,199
websites and and powerpoints and YouTube

198
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,909
videos and things like that in here to

199
00:07:18,909 --> 00:07:21,669
again give you a resources give you some

200
00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:25,840
resources to start the one thing I want

201
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,310
to say about boot camps and the

202
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,050
particularly highlighted text on here

203
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,219
and I can say this because I used to

204
00:07:30,219 --> 00:07:32,379
teach boot camps boot camps are good for

205
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:33,639
one thing and that's to get a

206
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:36,639
certification anybody that tells you

207
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:37,960
that you should take a boot camp to

208
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,729
learn anything don't listen to that

209
00:07:39,729 --> 00:07:42,129
person because we as an instructor

210
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,560
there's very little time for me to teach

211
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,259
you anything then the basic core things

212
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:49,210
and how to pass that particular exam and

213
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,400
that's what the boot camp is for the

214
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,529
boot camp is for that instructor to get

215
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:55,180
you to pass that exam so you get that

216
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,370
certification and a lot of cases that's

217
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,930
how the instructors are actually paid

218
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:01,870
alright so that was it my case but a lot

219
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,400
of the instructors are actually paid

220
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,020
based on the student pass rate of that

221
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,270
class so that kind of gives you an idea

222
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,219
of what their focus is and I don't care

223
00:08:09,219 --> 00:08:10,539
if it's a net plus class in a d-plus

224
00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:11,860
class is a certified ethical hacker

225
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,229
class the CISSP class it's pretty much

226
00:08:14,229 --> 00:08:16,120
the standard across these boot camps and

227
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,529
they're also really expensive and

228
00:08:17,529 --> 00:08:19,330
frankly not all the instructors are

229
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:21,099
really good again I'm allowed to say

230
00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:23,529
that I was an instructor so you can

231
00:08:23,529 --> 00:08:25,629
study all of that stuff on your own just

232
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:27,639
go get the book from the bookstore or

233
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:31,389
Amazon or the library or take a college

234
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:33,339
class that teaches that particular skill

235
00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:35,589
so the other problem with those boot

236
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:37,328
camps are you're trying to learn about

237
00:08:37,328 --> 00:08:39,760
700 pages worth of material in a lot of

238
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,149
cases in like 40 hours so a lot of

239
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:45,190
people really aren't learning things

240
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,410
during the boot camp so you could take a

241
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,269
networking class or a cybersecurity

242
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:51,310
class or an ethical hacking class

243
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,839
through a lot of different universities

244
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,180
this semester long courses now as well

245
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,020
so

246
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:59,890
even the online colleges that offer

247
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:02,170
those classes which may not be the

248
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,960
world's best class on the on the planet

249
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,520
it's probably going to be a better

250
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,990
experience than a boot camp in some

251
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,450
cases so some of this is going to

252
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,270
depending on what works for you but my

253
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,710
general advice is if you're just trying

254
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,390
to start out don't spend a lot of money

255
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,740
on a boot camp just because you think

256
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,720
you need net plus or a set plus

257
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,270
certification study on your own there's

258
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,270
lots of free websites and if you can

259
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,710
ever get anybody to pay for a sans

260
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,150
course I still highly recommend that

261
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,160
like I said hopefully next month I'll go

262
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,630
to my first one so some people who are

263
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:37,930
here are in college or younger than I am

264
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:40,090
and just trying to break into the work

265
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:43,600
job field in general and some people are

266
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,490
here sort of pivoting mid-career or

267
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:49,330
pivoting blade career as it were so some

268
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,190
of those people are gonna have IT

269
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,770
networking fundamentals but some of the

270
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:55,240
younger people in the audience might

271
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,160
still be working on those IT networking

272
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,890
fundamentals so you're not gonna have to

273
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:03,270
necessarily be network engineer level of

274
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,560
underpinning here depending on what you

275
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,300
want to do in cybersecurity but you

276
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,740
really have to understand a lot of the

277
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,780
basics you have to understand tcp/ip and

278
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,430
UDP in the three-way handshakes and

279
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,170
ports and protocols and how Windows

280
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,330
doesn't work and how Linux works and etc

281
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:19,150
right you have to understand a lot of

282
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,190
these basic fundamental things that are

283
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:23,230
happening in the operating systems and

284
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:25,600
with the data moving back and forth and

285
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,340
how a security appliance works or how it

286
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,200
doesn't work or how I want to break it

287
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,580
or why it needs certain security

288
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,370
settings a lot of that is on the IT side

289
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:36,820
and then it will translate as you start

290
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,920
to focus on that particular cyber

291
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,350
security job role that you've picked out

292
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:44,380
earlier that we talked about so again

293
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,670
these are all links to various things

294
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,530
like I'm a big fan of professor Messer

295
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,600
it's not just because he's bald to think

296
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,920
he does a really good job of explaining

297
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,710
these concepts so I like to link to his

298
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:54,160
stuff

299
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,560
there's lots of free resources online so

300
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,660
I tried to collate some of these things

301
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,910
in this presentation so you'll have you

302
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,590
know a place to start you can go to here

303
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:05,950
and then there's Google or Bing does

304
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:08,340
anybody who's been

305
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:11,410
so education and training so just like

306
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:13,120
anything else in education and training

307
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,220
everybody has preferred learning styles

308
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,650
as well so some people do really good

309
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:19,570
one-on-one some people need that

310
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:22,030
in-person classroom interaction with the

311
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,530
other students and the professor and

312
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:26,290
hopefully you'll at this stage you kind

313
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:28,450
of understand how you learn best some

314
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,940
people could read a Berk read a book and

315
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,890
just it's not the way they learn you

316
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:34,210
know they could take notes they could

317
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,470
highlight they just don't it just

318
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,390
doesn't come across that way maybe

319
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,520
somebody is better at watching all these

320
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,950
videos online right so you'll kind of

321
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,510
have to figure that out a little bit too

322
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:46,150
but there's lots of resources regardless

323
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,190
of your preferred way that you start to

324
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:51,760
absorb this information so I just think

325
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,670
that I want to stress that because it

326
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,260
kind of goes back to my bootcamp point

327
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,060
as well some people do good in boot

328
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,490
camps and that's fine that boot camp

329
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,860
drinking from a fire hose just isn't for

330
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,390
everyone and some people were in that

331
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,750
environment get very frustrated

332
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,460
there's also MOOCs online I didn't list

333
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,560
particular ones but I think Harvard and

334
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,170
MIT have some in particular that are

335
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:16,060
available online for free and there's a

336
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,830
lot of free resources that's my main

337
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,360
thing here is there's lots of free

338
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,240
resources to help you on your path to

339
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,670
start researching and learning whatever

340
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:28,780
it is that you want and then bottom how

341
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,250
do you get how do you start to actually

342
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,600
practice some of these things that

343
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,490
you're reading about or learning about

344
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:36,640
online is you need to have a lab you're

345
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,750
gonna have to do some of this

346
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:41,650
experimentation on your own so as a ceh

347
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:44,170
instructor one the easy console labs are

348
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:45,370
terrible I hope they don't watch this

349
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:48,580
video but they're terrible and they're

350
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,860
not realistic so anything you do in your

351
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,780
home lab is pretty much better than what

352
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,310
most of the ec-council

353
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:57,760
provides you for CDH so go buy an old

354
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,060
computer from eBay or freecycle or

355
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,670
Craigslist run some VMS on there and

356
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:08,380
practice things so this really brings us

357
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,230
to this next point is that you need to

358
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,060
have some of this you need to bring this

359
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,130
curiosity this intellectual curiosity

360
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:17,920
this intellectual initiative to

361
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,440
understand really why I stress having a

362
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:20,690
whole

363
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:23,240
lab is so critical so that you can

364
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,190
practice whatever skills it is that

365
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,930
you're learning at that moment if you've

366
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:30,200
never hack tap ass word then download

367
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,840
Kali in a VM and stand up some Windows 7

368
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,000
server that's not patched and see what

369
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,200
it's like to actually hack some

370
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,780
passwords right wait you're saying well

371
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,880
I want to study policy no better way to

372
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,250
understand password policy than trying

373
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,570
to hack a password and learn what

374
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:47,090
password entropy really means the next

375
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,680
time you write a ridiculous password

376
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:55,730
policy all right so sidebar so the the

377
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:59,060
college courses that I have heard mostly

378
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,130
from my friends and colleagues still

379
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:04,190
aren't doing a very good job providing a

380
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,690
lot of hands-on skills and there's a lot

381
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:08,150
of reasons that many programs struggle

382
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:10,430
with this a lot of times its online it's

383
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,990
very difficult to have the lab set up

384
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:14,060
but there are some colleges who

385
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,680
specialized in in their cybersecurity

386
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,990
programs a lot more so you want to do

387
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,600
some research as well and get reviews

388
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,880
about particular organizations and what

389
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,100
they do or don't offer like I would not

390
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,800
necessarily recommend the program I went

391
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,930
through all right and that has widely

392
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,520
been the opinion of my friends and

393
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,620
colleagues that took classes with that

394
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,870
institution but there are better

395
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:39,170
institutions as well so again you that

396
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,240
all those things cost money so just get

397
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,800
some reviews first and find out from

398
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,990
other people whether the classes you're

399
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:47,840
considering have good reviews if that

400
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,970
for whatever purpose it is if you're

401
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,920
taking that to learn hands-on see

402
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,370
whether their labs are any good there's

403
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,570
lots of different ways you can set up

404
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,850
your home lab again just buy some cheapo

405
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,310
computers that somebody's getting rid of

406
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,690
or if you're interested in forensics buy

407
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,070
some cheapo computer somebody's getting

408
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,350
rid of and then see what's on them still

409
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:09,260
buy some cheapo electronics devices and

410
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,790
phones on the internet and see what's on

411
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,830
them still like some people who are

412
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,060
interested in forensics wanted some

413
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,190
advice and my advice was buy stuff on

414
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:18,380
the internet and find all of the data

415
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,600
that's still on it like that's your own

416
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,270
it's choose-your-own-adventure CTF for

417
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:27,470
forensics honestly but you should be

418
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,990
able to set up some VMS and there's lots

419
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:32,390
of walkthroughs to set up VMs you don't

420
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,769
have to use VMware there's

421
00:15:33,769 --> 00:15:35,239
there's other options for you you'll

422
00:15:35,239 --> 00:15:36,920
probably want to look into that but I

423
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,689
can't stress enough how critical this is

424
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:41,480
so why is he stressing all about these

425
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,119
labs because a lot of people will say

426
00:15:44,119 --> 00:15:45,769
well I don't have practical hands-on

427
00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:46,970
experience because I can't get a job

428
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:48,619
because I don't have practical hands-on

429
00:15:48,619 --> 00:15:50,480
experience because I can't get a job all

430
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:50,869
right

431
00:15:50,869 --> 00:15:54,019
so this is where my crazy advice comes

432
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:56,029
in you probably want to take a look at

433
00:15:56,029 --> 00:15:58,069
how you have your resume formatted and

434
00:15:58,069 --> 00:15:59,749
have a section on there for inner

435
00:15:59,749 --> 00:16:01,939
independent research or continuing

436
00:16:01,939 --> 00:16:04,639
education or independent study and list

437
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,499
the things that you're doing I'm going

438
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:09,139
to particular CTS I'm going to besides

439
00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:12,139
Pittsburgh I'm part of the is e-square

440
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:16,279
chapter I go to issa events and describe

441
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:18,259
your home lab and the specific things

442
00:16:18,259 --> 00:16:20,929
you're working on for that job that

443
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:22,610
you're trying to break into right

444
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,529
because not everything is applicable you

445
00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:26,089
can also have multiple versions of your

446
00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:27,709
resume depending on what it is that

447
00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:29,989
you're applying for as well so maybe you

448
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,759
could have a section in your cover

449
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,920
letter cover letter that covers that if

450
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,679
you don't want to change your resume and

451
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:38,089
there are people that are out there to

452
00:16:38,089 --> 00:16:41,240
help you build your resumes as well but

453
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,769
I would say if you're practicing in your

454
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:44,360
home lab because you really want to be

455
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,290
good you know a sock entry-level sock

456
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,299
Tier one type of analyst which is how a

457
00:16:50,299 --> 00:16:52,879
lot of people get started and you know

458
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,230
you're gonna have to be doing a bunch of

459
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:56,689
log analysis practice Windows log

460
00:16:56,689 --> 00:16:59,059
analysis in your house practice packet

461
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:02,360
capturing and be able to find different

462
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,089
information in the pcap itself and then

463
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:06,888
you could list that under independent

464
00:17:06,888 --> 00:17:09,049
study it's not the same as professional

465
00:17:09,049 --> 00:17:11,029
experience but it it may catch someone's

466
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:12,409
eye and that's you're really trying to

467
00:17:12,409 --> 00:17:14,779
differentiate yourself so I really like

468
00:17:14,779 --> 00:17:16,669
this slide this slide is called why my

469
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:17,809
mom thinks I know everything about

470
00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:20,299
computers or Google it would be the

471
00:17:20,299 --> 00:17:23,809
other name of this slide so this is a

472
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:26,179
really big skill in IT and cybersecurity

473
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:28,789
and it's hard to characterize it's

474
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:31,399
called the it's called Tuesday and

475
00:17:31,399 --> 00:17:32,960
something has happened and no one knows

476
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,090
how to do that thing right that's

477
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:37,490
anybody in cybersecurity will hopefully

478
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,320
agree that this is very true so we tried

479
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,580
the thing did that work no and then we

480
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,779
try the next thing well that didn't work

481
00:17:41,779 --> 00:17:45,020
either well go to Google did that work

482
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:45,880
no now

483
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,230
call other people now we call their

484
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,790
departments now we call our professional

485
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,380
colleagues who work in other areas

486
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,930
because that's how we solve problems at

487
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:56,170
cybersecurity but this is true even at

488
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:58,090
the beginner level so as you're working

489
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:00,130
with mentors or friends who know you're

490
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:01,660
trying to get into here and you're

491
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,940
having trouble doing something in a CTF

492
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,100
maybe an online CTF or you're just

493
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,810
trying to understand something in a book

494
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:10,570
and it's not working your home lab if

495
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:12,820
you're if you're asking for help from

496
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,200
professionals they're probably going to

497
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,140
ask you well what have you already tried

498
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,730
right and that's where we want to see

499
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,650
that you you know if we're mentoring you

500
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:21,850
or were one of your professional

501
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,710
colleagues that you are trying different

502
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:26,170
things for whatever that situation is in

503
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:28,870
your home lab and again that tells me

504
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:30,160
that you have that initiative and

505
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,530
curiosity to to excel in this field if

506
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:34,000
you're like well I googled it and I

507
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,200
tried that thing that came up and I

508
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,540
didn't work that's you're gonna have

509
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,190
trouble finding technical people to

510
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:41,470
continue to help you right so this is an

511
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,570
area cybersecurity where a lot of people

512
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,340
will bang their head on the wall and try

513
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,350
lots of different things to solve a

514
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,930
problem or solve a situation and that

515
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:52,600
that process is related to to learning

516
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,060
things in your lab as well and the other

517
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,890
thing while I'm on this slide I'll talk

518
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:59,440
about your lab is it some people who are

519
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,120
trying to pivot into cybersecurity have

520
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,010
sort of a fear factor an intimidation

521
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:04,690
factor because they're gonna mess

522
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:07,150
something up yes you are

523
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:10,000
I have bricked a number of computers and

524
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,040
those were great learning experiences

525
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,990
and I have never scared of a computer

526
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:16,120
exactly that way since then all right

527
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,730
but that's true right think back to when

528
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:19,660
we were in middle school we didn't get

529
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,180
every test answer right like there's a

530
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:25,600
learning process that occurs here so you

531
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,340
will probably make some mistakes so

532
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,200
don't do this on your family's only

533
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,450
computer that you pay the bills on go

534
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:33,820
get something from ebay you know find

535
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,410
out what's still on it do some

536
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:37,660
experiments get some VMS because you

537
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,070
don't want to ruin the only computer

538
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,570
that you have or the one that you need

539
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:42,880
for a college or whatever so that's why

540
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,440
I'm saying there's some other options

541
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,200
here but you shouldn't be afraid to

542
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,850
experience failure as part of this

543
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,290
learning experience in your home lab

544
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,180
that you should actually embrace that a

545
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,440
little bit or probably scary when it

546
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,450
happens and then windows doesn't boot

547
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:57,100
for some reason anymore because you've

548
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,260
changed some files or whatever

549
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,850
and then you just learn how terrible it

550
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,200
is to install windows is an operating

551
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,580
system which is a good learning

552
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,500
experience that's why everyone should

553
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:11,260
use Linux so some other specific things

554
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,390
so when we talk about sort of entry

555
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:15,820
level security type jobs you know I

556
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,770
wanted to give another example of some

557
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,990
specific tools that you might want to

558
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:22,270
use in your lab as it pertains to sort

559
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:25,090
of security defense security analyst

560
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,680
these go by any number of different

561
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,380
names and are in our world that would

562
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,270
you could practice in your home lab to

563
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,400
find out what's really going on all

564
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,870
right so this is like if you're one of

565
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:35,410
those people that's like

566
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:37,810
control-alt-delete and then we can see

567
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,160
all the processes windows running

568
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,440
because Windows running 186 processes

569
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,240
and that's why it's terrible all right

570
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,070
this is sort of all the next level of

571
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,600
everything else Windows is doing that's

572
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,510
terrible or whatever operating system so

573
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,250
for instance if you've never really

574
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,080
messed around and understood Windows

575
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,720
then when sysinternals is a really

576
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,880
interesting tool suite and there's a lot

577
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,720
of different Administrative Tools

578
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,440
available for that to help you

579
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,600
understand what's really going on on

580
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,120
your Windows system why do you have ten

581
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,730
thousand tcp/ip connections open right

582
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:11,680
now I have no idea probably because it's

583
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,980
Windows not that I hate Windows that's

584
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,500
uh that's how this is coming across if

585
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,970
you're really interested in forensics

586
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:20,590
there's a bulk extractor tool there are

587
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:23,440
some specific forensics et CTFs that are

588
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,620
out there where you'll have to use some

589
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:28,510
CTF some forensics tools in the CTF

590
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,310
there's a bunch of free stenography

591
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,720
tools that are available if you want to

592
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,630
really understand how stego works so

593
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:36,310
again I don't want you to study

594
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:38,560
forensics tools if you're interested in

595
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,570
you know being a vulnerability tester

596
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:43,750
right then then go to necess right so

597
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,550
again that's how scoping this will help

598
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,840
you sort of narrow down some of the

599
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,100
things you could be working on in your

600
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,160
lab because there's way too much and

601
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,110
again password cracking tools if you've

602
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,670
never passed it I don't care what role

603
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:56,290
you want go cracks and passwords that's

604
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,490
pretty cool it's a very interesting

605
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,920
experience to actually crack some

606
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,840
passwords you know whichever way you

607
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,400
want to try and crack the password it's

608
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,810
very interesting experience to see that

609
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:07,330
happen you know try to hack into a

610
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:09,670
Windows 98 VM just to see what it's like

611
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:11,080
even if that's not really the thing you

612
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,100
want to do that's a very interesting

613
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,090
experience

614
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:15,159
there are still windows 98 boxes out in

615
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:20,190
the world so there I work in the DoD so

616
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:22,870
so again if you're if you're in your

617
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,309
home lab and you're working on all this

618
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:25,929
stuff and there's a couple different

619
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:28,840
tools that are probably related to that

620
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,389
job you want again try to be as

621
00:22:31,389 --> 00:22:32,740
proficient as you can be with those

622
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:35,230
tools in your home lab so when you write

623
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,450
I'm proficient with Wireshark and necess

624
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:39,279
on your resume you're not lying

625
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:40,330
but you're not you're not

626
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:41,950
misrepresenting it either right you're

627
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,720
listing that under independent research

628
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,029
right don't list it under some sort of

629
00:22:46,029 --> 00:22:50,470
professional career area make sure you

630
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,629
call it out but that may get you past

631
00:22:52,629 --> 00:22:54,429
that 10-second screening because it

632
00:22:54,429 --> 00:22:56,080
shows that you obviously are doing

633
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,940
things that other people aren't doing

634
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,200
who are trying to break into the

635
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,299
industry so I know it's been almost 30

636
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:05,559
minutes and you're like this guy still

637
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:07,330
hasn't told me how to get a job sorry

638
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:11,619
so there's again what type of specific

639
00:23:11,619 --> 00:23:14,080
job are you trying to get so a lot of

640
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,220
people don't want to hear this advice

641
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,779
that you have to develop a whole bunch

642
00:23:16,779 --> 00:23:18,970
of technical skills some of this you're

643
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:20,710
gonna have to just invest time on your

644
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:23,409
own in your own lab right and then

645
00:23:23,409 --> 00:23:25,450
you're gonna have to network like in

646
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,369
person which you guys are doing all here

647
00:23:27,369 --> 00:23:29,409
today and then there's going to be an

648
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:31,149
opportunity and then you hope that that

649
00:23:31,149 --> 00:23:33,129
guy that you met on LinkedIn that you've

650
00:23:33,129 --> 00:23:34,629
connected with remembers that you were

651
00:23:34,629 --> 00:23:37,090
looking for the job people don't like to

652
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:39,129
hear that that still hall job happens

653
00:23:39,129 --> 00:23:41,529
but in my experience that's how a lot of

654
00:23:41,529 --> 00:23:44,950
actual openings get filled so lots of

655
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:47,559
people apply online to the websites and

656
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:49,659
they don't hear back because if I know

657
00:23:49,659 --> 00:23:52,539
that my colleague is recommending

658
00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:54,610
somebody that he knows wants a job I'm

659
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:56,769
much more likely to consider that

660
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:58,480
candidate because it's coming through my

661
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,210
professional network now that's not good

662
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:05,289
fare bad it's just in my experience what

663
00:24:05,289 --> 00:24:09,399
very typically happens so go to the IC

664
00:24:09,399 --> 00:24:12,220
Squared go to you know CTS continue to

665
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,230
go to events like this you got a bunch

666
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:16,149
of colleges here in Pittsburgh so I'm

667
00:24:16,149 --> 00:24:17,740
sure they have tons of events if you're

668
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,749
local here to go to all of their events

669
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:22,779
that you can so you may need some

670
00:24:22,779 --> 00:24:25,210
certifications it depends on the job you

671
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,650
may not need certifications you

672
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:29,020
may want to take a look at you know the

673
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:32,050
job descriptions that are related to

674
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,490
that particular field you're interested

675
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:34,870
in to see if that's coming up as a

676
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:37,660
requirement so again we've talked about

677
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,650
sans a little bit

678
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:40,030
I still think certified ethical hacker

679
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:42,100
has a little bit of weight there will be

680
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,230
people that disagree with me that's why

681
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:46,090
they're called opinions

682
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:48,130
I still think possibly having that

683
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:49,990
certification means that you at least

684
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:52,180
understand the basics of hacking and

685
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,740
that's very helpful if you're on the

686
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,210
defensive side we need to know what the

687
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:58,150
attackers are doing or else what what

688
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:00,370
else are we basing the defense on so

689
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:01,540
it's pretty important to understand what

690
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,790
the attackers are doing can you do

691
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,890
packet analysis may be your job to cert

692
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:08,440
require you to do packet analysis but if

693
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,600
you can if that question comes up in an

694
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,360
interview and you're able to describe

695
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,050
the process or possibly even show me how

696
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:19,360
a TCP 3-way handshake looks at the

697
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,190
packet level that tells me you have a

698
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,600
certain level of understanding at that

699
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,370
point even though it may not be a core

700
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:27,370
skill that you're going to use you know

701
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:30,400
a lot of admins in cybersecurity people

702
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,200
protect windows because it's what most

703
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,240
people use but do you really understand

704
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,920
Windows Server do you understand domain

705
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,330
functionality do you understand Group

706
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:39,340
Policy settings all right if you don't

707
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,980
download a Windows Server ISO stand it

708
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:44,290
up in your lab break it lots of times

709
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:46,210
look at all the configuration settings

710
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:47,560
figure out everything there is about

711
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,230
that you're gonna have to know VMware I

712
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:52,270
think for a lot of different hands-on

713
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,860
technical jobs I think that's a pretty

714
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,390
critical skill it's also critical for

715
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:57,550
you to play around in your home lab or

716
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:00,310
do CTF s-- in some cases if you're doing

717
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:02,260
anything with malware you're gonna want

718
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,860
to do it in a VM Linux you probably

719
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,650
should know some flavor and ability to

720
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,690
navigate in Linux it's not necessary for

721
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:14,740
every field or every job but knowing

722
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,360
that there's operating systems beyond

723
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,220
Windows is pretty important and knowing

724
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,480
how to use them is going to be pretty

725
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:23,050
critical you know you might want to look

726
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:24,670
at all the ocean tools a lot of these

727
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:27,190
ocean tools are used across different

728
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,990
cyber security disciplines and different

729
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:31,710
jobs virustotal is a really big one

730
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:34,780
sites like central ops tools like multi

731
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,820
go

732
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,830
I think necess is a really good you know

733
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:39,909
free vulnerability scan

734
00:26:39,909 --> 00:26:41,109
you could play around with it your house

735
00:26:41,109 --> 00:26:43,509
and understand if scan your house look

736
00:26:43,509 --> 00:26:45,009
at the vulnerability report if you've

737
00:26:45,009 --> 00:26:47,829
never seen one before and burps we will

738
00:26:47,829 --> 00:26:50,049
show you the horrors of the Internet and

739
00:26:50,049 --> 00:26:52,690
why internet websites are bad right

740
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:54,069
there is no better tool than burp suite

741
00:26:54,069 --> 00:26:55,929
for you to never buy anything on the

742
00:26:55,929 --> 00:26:57,489
internet again which of course we will

743
00:26:57,489 --> 00:27:01,199
all do anyway so again use this is just

744
00:27:01,199 --> 00:27:04,419
some advice I think that if in your if

745
00:27:04,419 --> 00:27:06,369
you're using that home lab and trying to

746
00:27:06,369 --> 00:27:09,159
have that portion of your resume or be

747
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:11,429
able to talk to a variety of tools is

748
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:15,729
useful so the other problem with getting

749
00:27:15,729 --> 00:27:17,469
that first job is that first I was like

750
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,399
well we need somebody who don't

751
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:21,609
understand Splunk okay well I might not

752
00:27:21,609 --> 00:27:23,349
understand Splunk but I could possibly

753
00:27:23,349 --> 00:27:26,079
speak to related tools that allow me to

754
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:29,739
do maybe similar analysis right so it

755
00:27:29,739 --> 00:27:31,839
depends it's gonna depend on what that

756
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:33,999
interview panel really considers are

757
00:27:33,999 --> 00:27:36,339
they hiring somebody that knows spunk or

758
00:27:36,339 --> 00:27:37,989
are they hiring somebody that has the

759
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,419
initiative to be an interesting and in

760
00:27:40,419 --> 00:27:42,759
curious cyber security engineer right

761
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:45,519
not all panels and not all people who

762
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:48,009
make the final decisions are gonna have

763
00:27:48,009 --> 00:27:49,599
the same outlook when they're hiring a

764
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:53,409
candidate and some people really like

765
00:27:53,409 --> 00:27:55,179
breaking things and hacking things and

766
00:27:55,179 --> 00:27:58,299
there's obviously room for all people in

767
00:27:58,299 --> 00:28:01,989
this world in cybersecurity so again

768
00:28:01,989 --> 00:28:04,569
this is not something you're probably

769
00:28:04,569 --> 00:28:06,669
going to get many entry-level jobs into

770
00:28:06,669 --> 00:28:09,039
so I don't want to dissuade you from

771
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,229
having the goal of being a white hat

772
00:28:11,229 --> 00:28:13,299
hacker an ethical hacker but there's a

773
00:28:13,299 --> 00:28:15,609
process there's a lot that you need to

774
00:28:15,609 --> 00:28:17,769
know to get that first entry-level job

775
00:28:17,769 --> 00:28:18,999
on the red team or that first

776
00:28:18,999 --> 00:28:22,209
entry-level job is a white hat hacker so

777
00:28:22,209 --> 00:28:24,489
again there's lots of free resources on

778
00:28:24,489 --> 00:28:26,409
how to go about that particular journey

779
00:28:26,409 --> 00:28:28,479
once you know all the IT fundamentals

780
00:28:28,479 --> 00:28:29,440
once you have a pretty solid

781
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,440
cybersecurity background as well then

782
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,329
you could move on to start doing

783
00:28:34,329 --> 00:28:36,399
yourself study to try to get that next

784
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:37,690
role if you want to really be a pen

785
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:40,389
tester if that's your goal so I don't I

786
00:28:40,389 --> 00:28:41,499
don't want to make it sound like nobody

787
00:28:41,499 --> 00:28:42,879
should be a pen tester because trust me

788
00:28:42,879 --> 00:28:44,859
we need pen testers I just want to make

789
00:28:44,859 --> 00:28:46,299
sure we're setting some ground rules for

790
00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:48,399
what's kind of realistic versus

791
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:51,009
entry-level jobs so there's a lot of

792
00:28:51,009 --> 00:28:53,650
different resources up here as well

793
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:56,020
and there's lots of other things that I

794
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,090
had some resources too there's cyber

795
00:28:58,090 --> 00:28:59,620
counterintelligence roles if you're

796
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,960
really interested in sort of the DoD and

797
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,030
defense contractor world that starts to

798
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:06,100
get a little bit more specific I have

799
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,750
some things linking in here about

800
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,250
advanced persistent threats if you're

801
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,990
really interested in cyber threat Intel

802
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,790
I can give you a lot more resources

803
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,610
about that

804
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:17,440
so I debated a lot about whether I want

805
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,990
to keep this slide in or not but I get a

806
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:21,520
lot of questions about this and there's

807
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,050
not really a good answer about

808
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:26,320
cybersecurity career paths so I don't

809
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,910
like any of the graphics that came up so

810
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:31,480
I picked one so in this one it it looks

811
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,160
like oh the pen tester like that's the

812
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:37,420
epitome and clearly there is some some

813
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,740
sense that that's correct

814
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:41,110
because they do require so much

815
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,460
knowledge and engineering and it also

816
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:45,190
requires the the right people to be pen

817
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:48,700
testers right we all probably know some

818
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,870
pen testers and there's a certain

819
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:51,400
mentality and a personality that goes

820
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,660
along with somebody that's a really good

821
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,670
pen tester but that doesn't mean

822
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:56,980
everybody wants to be a pen tester

823
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:59,530
either which is fine because we need you

824
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:01,870
know the guy on the sock or the girl on

825
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,610
the sock who's been there for 15 years

826
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:05,410
and every time nobody can answer the

827
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:06,820
question anymore we all turn to that

828
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,590
expert who's been there a long time we

829
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,510
need that person to and they may never

830
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:12,790
want to be a pen tester and that's fine

831
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:15,100
we also need people like myself who've

832
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,110
managed to work themself into management

833
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:19,750
yeh so we need people like that who can

834
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:22,150
lead teams for whatever discipline that

835
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:24,580
you're in so that we can understand the

836
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:27,040
team and whatever technical aspect the

837
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,990
team is and then talk to non-technical

838
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:30,910
people right talk to the board

839
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:33,340
talk to management talk to leadership so

840
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,920
I'm not a big fan of cybersecurity

841
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,680
career paths I know some people who

842
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,300
started out who are pen testers who

843
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,270
started out as EMTs I started out in the

844
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:45,910
Army and Intel there's lots of different

845
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:48,280
ways people can find themselves involved

846
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,050
in cybersecurity and in this as a

847
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:52,240
profession so if anybody has told you

848
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,350
well you can't do this you don't have

849
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:55,270
that background well screw that person I

850
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,950
don't know who they are but there's lots

851
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,840
of people who eventually become cyber

852
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,030
security experts and work in this field

853
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,410
who come from all sorts of different

854
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:04,030
types of backgrounds some people are

855
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,380
just gonna have to work at it a little

856
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,940
harder or it may take a little bit more

857
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:07,450
time

858
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:09,340
if you don't have that IT background

859
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:12,130
first so I think anything's possible

860
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:16,200
you're willing to put in the effort so

861
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,840
other things about getting that first

862
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,820
job and really pivoting here into

863
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:24,420
cybersecurity so continue to network

864
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,710
have some business cards I don't know

865
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:28,210
maybe I'm getting too old and people

866
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:30,370
don't have business cards for like 20

867
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:31,990
bucks you can go on vistaprint and print

868
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,430
a business card that has your name and

869
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:34,960
email and phone number on it

870
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,410
so I mean that's how that's how I

871
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:40,120
operate I'm gonna take all the business

872
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,260
cards I got here and try to find

873
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,210
everybody on LinkedIn and try to link up

874
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:45,370
right not everybody does that lots and

875
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,510
lots of people are using Twitter

876
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:48,940
nowadays but you have to have some sort

877
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,200
of way to network to build that

878
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,120
professional association of people who

879
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,920
work in this field so whatever works for

880
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:57,310
you you should continue to do that again

881
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,780
I think it's all about knowing the right

882
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,760
people having some skills for a

883
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,430
particular opening and then there is a

884
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:07,150
degree of luck right but you can you

885
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:09,520
have some power here in that process to

886
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,260
influence it and that's kind of what I'm

887
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,970
trying to tell you is if you've been

888
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:14,470
applying for jobs in and it's not

889
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:18,850
working change your resume blog write

890
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:20,740
some code on github if that's your thing

891
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:23,350
do some things that make your resume

892
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:26,620
stand out during that 10 to 20 seconds

893
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,970
that it gets that initial look so you

894
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:29,920
make the next cut that's really what

895
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,830
you're trying to do right and also be

896
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:35,230
realistic about the types of jobs you're

897
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:37,810
trying to get if you are entering into

898
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:40,360
this field as a new person you are not

899
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:44,320
going to be a tear to pen tester like

900
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,030
that stop applying for that job just

901
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:48,130
stop applying for that job if you don't

902
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:49,770
have that background and the experience

903
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:53,800
so shift jobs definitely apply for those

904
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:57,670
use headhunters on the internet right

905
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:59,200
there there's some other strategies

906
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,490
potentially available too if you're

907
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:02,530
really struggling and we we could talk

908
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:04,060
about that or you you should have a

909
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,350
mentor that can talk through some of

910
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:08,080
that as well I would say definitely

911
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,820
prepare for your interview if this is a

912
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:13,000
new field for you and you don't have you

913
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,260
know lots of experience in 19

914
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,030
cybersecurity then I would definitely

915
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:18,040
prepare for the interview there's lots

916
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,960
of there's lots of questions you can get

917
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,750
on the internet

918
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,670
about what's really likely to be asked

919
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:26,120
there's really in in a standard

920
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,670
interview there's a couple core

921
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:30,230
technical questions that will probably

922
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:32,390
be asked and a couple core non-technical

923
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:34,160
questions that will be asked and you

924
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,080
should be able to answer those ones that

925
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,720
are very typical in a manner that makes

926
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,250
it seem like you've also prepared for

927
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:42,440
the interview so this is the other thing

928
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,060
when you go into that interview as

929
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:46,100
somebody that hires people I am hiring

930
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:49,010
the whole person right I don't just get

931
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:51,290
your cybersecurity skills I get your

932
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:53,270
social interaction skills your

933
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:55,490
presentation skills I'm hiring that

934
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:57,860
whole person into the organization so

935
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,720
I'm taking everything into consideration

936
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,930
how interested do you seem to be in the

937
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:04,940
job if you don't seem to be interested I

938
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,080
don't understand why you're interviewing

939
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,880
with me that has happened more than one

940
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,409
time I really don't understand maybe

941
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:10,909
it's a weird government thing I don't

942
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:12,620
know all right but if you don't even

943
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,480
seem like you want to be here you I mean

944
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,129
we'll go through the motions because I

945
00:34:16,129 --> 00:34:20,739
have to but you're not being selected so

946
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:22,879
there's lots of different types of

947
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:26,510
people in cybersecurity as well so I

948
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:28,790
wouldn't change your hairstyle don't get

949
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:30,199
caught up and all that kind of stuff as

950
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:32,750
a mentor be who you are because if the

951
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:34,668
if you're trying to get hired by an

952
00:34:34,668 --> 00:34:36,320
organization and they can't accept you

953
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,418
for the person you are that's not

954
00:34:38,418 --> 00:34:39,980
somewhere you want to work either so I'm

955
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:42,080
gonna throw that out there too because

956
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,480
not only are you interviewing for the

957
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,300
position you are also interviewing that

958
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,190
organization is that somewhere you want

959
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:51,560
to work you do want to keep that in mind

960
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,929
I know you want the job but you want to

961
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:55,340
keep in mind is that a place you want to

962
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:58,130
work and I have been burned before and

963
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,840
lied to in an interview so you just kind

964
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,370
of want to keep that in mind too the

965
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:05,900
interview is a two-way process when you

966
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,340
get a question that you don't know the

967
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:09,860
answer to there's one way you can answer

968
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,660
that and there's a there's a better way

969
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,520
you can answer that question if somebody

970
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,980
asks you a question and you don't know

971
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,720
the answer you can say no I don't know

972
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,910
the answer or you could say I don't know

973
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:21,950
I don't know that answer yet but I would

974
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:23,930
first research it on the internet and

975
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:25,310
see if I could figure it out and then I

976
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:26,960
would go around on my co-workers and see

977
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,130
if they knew the answer and if that

978
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:30,050
didn't help maybe I would go to my

979
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:31,340
professional network

980
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:33,500
right there this is why you want to

981
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,660
practice interviews there's there's

982
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,220
places and people that can help you with

983
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,450
interviews or you could just ask your

984
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:39,920
friends and family and random people in

985
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,900
Pittsburgh help that might not be good

986
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:45,530
idea again study what you enjoy don't

987
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:48,710
study things that you hate and try to

988
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,720
find mentors the one thing I will say

989
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,970
about mentors is that you shouldn't only

990
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:56,180
have mentors where you work all right

991
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:59,420
because I have mentored people and it

992
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,770
was clearly time for them to go to

993
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:04,070
another company to get another job and I

994
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:05,360
told them that I didn't really care I

995
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,700
was their mentor but you will find that

996
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,860
if only if your mentors are only at the

997
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:12,320
organisation you work out most of them

998
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,970
probably aren't going to tell you when

999
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:15,860
they think it's time for you to actually

1000
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:18,560
leave that organization if you are

1001
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,540
trying to pursue career advancement and

1002
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,620
it's not happening

1003
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,810
so there's another thing to keep in mind

1004
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:26,420
so have some varied mentorship perhaps

1005
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,050
as well

1006
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:29,690
the last thing about mentors I want to

1007
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:31,940
say is that if you've been in this in

1008
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:34,370
cybersecurity for a couple of years you

1009
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:36,050
know you're on your first or second job

1010
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:38,720
maybe the high school or your alma mater

1011
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,670
could really use you to come back and

1012
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:42,230
talk and you may not think of yourself

1013
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:45,740
as a mentor because you're not old but

1014
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,450
you're old enough to provide really

1015
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:50,300
valuable insights to that 19 year old 20

1016
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,340
year old kid or the high school hacker

1017
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,440
team or whatever they've got so think

1018
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,310
about that as well

1019
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:58,100
we need more mentors in this field so I

1020
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,110
would encourage you to try to look for

1021
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,700
opportunities to give back to those that

1022
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:04,040
need advice at whatever level or age

1023
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,220
group they are so there's a lot of other

1024
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,380
links in here I really like the career

1025
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,600
advice because I don't think that career

1026
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,910
advice and mentorship across a career or

1027
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:17,120
something that is done very often or as

1028
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,590
widely as I would like to see it in

1029
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:22,010
cybersecurity so just a lot more links

1030
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:24,560
there and then a lot more resources so

1031
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,970
when you get to slide deck you gonna

1032
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:29,600
have all of these but I would like to

1033
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,910
entertain questions now if you guys have

1034
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:33,950
some questions so I don't have a

1035
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:36,410
particular silver bullet but hopefully I

1036
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:38,030
have some advice that will help you

1037
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:39,680
because we need all of you in

1038
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,970
cybersecurity so if you're not in

1039
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:43,370
cybersecurity already we want you in

1040
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:44,849
cybersecurity

1041
00:37:44,849 --> 00:37:51,989
we the global we the mysterious we any

1042
00:37:51,989 --> 00:38:01,259
questions yes the question is could I

1043
00:38:01,259 --> 00:38:02,130
talk a little bit more about

1044
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:07,109
vulnerability analysts sure so so your

1045
00:38:07,109 --> 00:38:08,579
vulnerability analysts are generally

1046
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:10,829
going to use a tool like nessus even the

1047
00:38:10,829 --> 00:38:13,259
DoD has a renamed version and it's

1048
00:38:13,259 --> 00:38:15,660
basically necess it's one of the most

1049
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,950
popular ones it's not the only

1050
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:19,200
vulnerability tool out there and a lot

1051
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,089
of vulnerability analysis today is done

1052
00:38:21,089 --> 00:38:23,880
on websites web servers you know front

1053
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,430
end that's where a lot of the breaches

1054
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:28,440
are coming from is from vulnerabilities

1055
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,930
that are on web servers so that's kind

1056
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:32,309
of a focus today but that's not the only

1057
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:36,479
thing web web vulnerability sorry web

1058
00:38:36,479 --> 00:38:38,430
sites web servers are not the only thing

1059
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:40,049
vulnerability assessments and testing

1060
00:38:40,049 --> 00:38:42,720
are done on but it seems to be very

1061
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:47,339
popular right now so some companies some

1062
00:38:47,339 --> 00:38:48,960
big companies will have vulnerability

1063
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,119
assessment teams so this is very very

1064
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,789
similar or also a way to to talk about

1065
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:56,910
bug bounty programs to a little bit that

1066
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:58,259
could be another way that you could put

1067
00:38:58,259 --> 00:38:59,969
something on your resume if you do find

1068
00:38:59,969 --> 00:39:04,200
legitimate bugs you know and that's it's

1069
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,999
confirmed that that was a vulnerability

1070
00:39:05,999 --> 00:39:07,710
or an actual bug you know you can add

1071
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:11,269
that to your resume as well more

1072
00:39:11,269 --> 00:39:14,039
companies more of the bigger companies

1073
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:15,239
are starting to understand they need

1074
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:17,249
some vulnerability management programs

1075
00:39:17,249 --> 00:39:20,910
in place because so many of the breaches

1076
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:22,650
are just coming from unpatched and

1077
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:26,190
misconfigured externally facing devices

1078
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:29,430
and insights I don't that answers your

1079
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:30,119
question

1080
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:33,979
okay anybody else yes

1081
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:58,100
yeah so there are there are a number of

1082
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:01,350
like legitimate bug bounty programs like

1083
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:05,640
hacker one there are some DoD ones my

1084
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,100
organization actually runs for DoD

1085
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,080
things but don't just randomly hack

1086
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,510
things on the internet as not advice you

1087
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,490
were given today like go through

1088
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:16,980
particular programs if you're interested

1089
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:19,080
in doing bug bounties a lot of times

1090
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,369
they're scoped and then you'll have

1091
00:40:20,369 --> 00:40:21,930
legal protections for that as well

1092
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:23,310
so you just want to be careful with that

1093
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:26,400
if that is of interest to you that's

1094
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:26,790
great

1095
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:28,170
we you know there's a lot of

1096
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:30,330
crowdsourcing bug bounty type things out

1097
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:33,540
there so whether it's you know Google

1098
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,640
has a programs and I know Facebook has

1099
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,980
some programs as well so just make sure

1100
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,180
you're going through whatever the

1101
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:41,670
company has in place for that so that

1102
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:43,560
you don't find yourself in any sort of

1103
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:48,410
legal jeopardy yes

1104
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:52,309
[Music]

1105
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,730
yeah so the comment here is there are

1106
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:07,560
some other niche areas that are still

1107
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,930
starting to grow like compliance with

1108
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:13,890
HIPAA PCI some of the NIST requirements

1109
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:16,860
for DoD contractors so again this field

1110
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,930
is continually growing and changing so

1111
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:22,620
there there are some other new new skill

1112
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:25,320
sets sort of near compliance and policy

1113
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,450
where there may be even more jobs

1114
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:30,330
opening up I definitely know policy

1115
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:32,130
people have then pivoted into more

1116
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:34,140
technical roles as well so even if you

1117
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:36,780
don't love policy there are people who

1118
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:39,110
love policy I don't understand them I

1119
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:42,270
don't understand you sir but there are

1120
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:43,860
people who like because they know the

1121
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,840
policy so well then decide eventually to

1122
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,670
become more technical as well so again

1123
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:49,350
there's lots of different career paths

1124
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:52,140
there's no there's there are no right or

1125
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,090
wrong ways to continue your career if

1126
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:56,370
you want to progress based on on where

1127
00:41:56,370 --> 00:42:00,300
do you find yourself in cybersecurity so

1128
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,770
we sell have a couple more minutes if

1129
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:05,780
you guys have questions yes

1130
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:20,990
yeah so there's there's some work/life

1131
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:23,510
balance issues that some people excel at

1132
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:25,250
and others don't depending on their

1133
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:27,710
personality and role may I have friends

1134
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:30,770
that have like stacks of equipment in

1135
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:32,900
their house and they're always

1136
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,330
researching new things and then I have

1137
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:37,070
people they go home at the end of the

1138
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:39,200
day and they don't do computer things so

1139
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,240
there's always gonna be a balance that

1140
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,070
you'll have to find and that may be

1141
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:44,810
something that changes over time so you

1142
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:46,340
may do a whole bunch of stuff because

1143
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:47,510
you're interested in something and then

1144
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:49,430
you sort of like ramp down and then you

1145
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:52,880
ramp back up again later you know as I

1146
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,890
said in my my intro like I do a lot of

1147
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:57,020
stuff with soccer so I don't tend to go

1148
00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:00,500
home and and spend hours and hours on

1149
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,450
end doing things but I follow things

1150
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:04,190
related to cyber threat information so

1151
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:05,630
I'm following the blogs I'm following

1152
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:07,160
people on Twitter and I'm trying to stay

1153
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,840
up to things that directly affect my job

1154
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:12,050
so I stay connected with that core sort

1155
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:16,250
of competencies but I think I think you

1156
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:18,290
have to find whatever balance works for

1157
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:21,740
you if you're trying to break into the

1158
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:23,330
field there's gonna be a lot more

1159
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:25,640
learning you have to do initially so

1160
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,740
when I'm hiring more junior people

1161
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:30,200
that's where I really have to see like

1162
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,640
you're passionate like you are

1163
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:32,990
interested in learning all about this

1164
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:34,360
because there's gonna be a lot to learn

1165
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:37,220
as part of you know as being a new

1166
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:39,380
person onto my team but that doesn't

1167
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:41,060
mean that the people I have on my team

1168
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:44,150
shouldn't show some level of interest in

1169
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:46,910
and passion going forward to because

1170
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:48,590
there's continual learning I don't care

1171
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:50,780
what field you do end up in there's

1172
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:52,610
continual learning if you're not a

1173
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:54,680
person that wants to be in that sort of

1174
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,390
field and don't be an IT and cyber

1175
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:57,980
security because it's changing all the

1176
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:01,150
time so whether it's policy compliance

1177
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:03,800
pentesting vulnerability management it's

1178
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,980
changing very rapidly all the time so at

1179
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:09,800
a minimum you need to be intellectually

1180
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,350
curious enough to stay up to date with

1181
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:14,270
whatever is required at a minimum for

1182
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:18,009
your job or your job field

1183
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:24,910
if there are more questions I can walk

1184
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:27,360
over with the mic as well so feel free

1185
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,500
yeah we have a couple more minutes so

1186
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,840
I'm happy to try to answer a question or

1187
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:46,060
make something up so my question is I

1188
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:48,250
just graduated college I have four years

1189
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:51,520
of internship experience most of it has

1190
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,190
been an insider threat and I loved what

1191
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:55,960
I did it was a lot of fun and I'm very

1192
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,240
thankful for the experience I had but

1193
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,500
I'm finding more so that my passion

1194
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,360
might be somewhere else insecurity

1195
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,120
should my first job opportunity should I

1196
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,770
be seeking out something and insider

1197
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:07,750
threat and then try to move laterally

1198
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:09,970
within a company for that or should I

1199
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:13,300
take the time now to kind of build some

1200
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:14,710
more of the prerequisites for some of

1201
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:16,300
these other positions and then aim for

1202
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:20,350
those for my first job I don't I don't

1203
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:22,180
know that there are wrong answers to

1204
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:24,520
that except move laterally in your

1205
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:27,610
company so I come from the Maryland DC

1206
00:45:27,610 --> 00:45:30,010
Virginia in Northern Area and most of

1207
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:31,630
the time when people move laterally it's

1208
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:33,910
not with that same company there there

1209
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:37,330
are in today's market there is a lot of

1210
00:45:37,330 --> 00:45:41,350
mobility in cybersecurity so and since

1211
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:43,030
nobody has retirement plans anymore

1212
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:45,370
basically there's very little incentive

1213
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:47,980
in a lot of cases again this is my

1214
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:50,140
opinion to necessarily stay at some

1215
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:51,580
company and have that level of

1216
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:52,780
dedication

1217
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:54,640
now there's pros and cons to everything

1218
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,020
you don't want to always move around

1219
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:58,030
either alright that may say something

1220
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:00,190
about your personality but there are a

1221
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:02,020
lot of resumes where every three years

1222
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:03,790
somebody is moving on to a new company

1223
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:06,490
that is pretty standard MO in the

1224
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:09,760
contracting world in the greater DC area

1225
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,980
and that may not be true in other

1226
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:13,960
markets though so you'll want to take a

1227
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:17,110
look at that because in my opinion

1228
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:19,390
somebody that has stated a company now

1229
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:22,120
for a really long time in the same role

1230
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:24,430
may not be somebody that's my first

1231
00:46:24,430 --> 00:46:26,950
choice to hire but now if they've moved

1232
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:29,110
throughout the company that's fine as

1233
00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:31,480
well so it is hard to find a company

1234
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:32,290
though that will

1235
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:34,930
Sara Lee let you do that it is frankly

1236
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:37,030
difficult to sometimes find the company

1237
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:39,490
that has enough flexibility in their

1238
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:40,840
structure and their management

1239
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,820
organization and their business unit

1240
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:46,090
lines too to let you go from one role to

1241
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:48,010
another role and I'm not gonna say it's

1242
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:50,740
impossible but you may face difficulties

1243
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:52,090
which is again why I think you should

1244
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:54,940
have mentors outside of that primary job

1245
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:57,340
that you have as well because there may

1246
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:58,780
be an opportunity if you if you take

1247
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:00,280
that cyber threat into a role and you're

1248
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,440
in it for two or three years and you

1249
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:04,180
know there's just empty promises that

1250
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:06,730
one day maybe we'll move you you know it

1251
00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:08,980
may be time to find another opportunity

1252
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:10,840
and then pivot into that other role that

1253
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:13,390
you think you might want more so I don't

1254
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:14,770
know if I really answered your question

1255
00:47:14,770 --> 00:47:16,690
but those are my thoughts about it you

1256
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:22,060
know thank you sure yeah yeah we've got

1257
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:25,049
we've got two over here

1258
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:33,100
you had mentioned making the slides

1259
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:36,220
available how do you get them I assume

1260
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:37,270
they're gonna there's a b-side

1261
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:39,450
Pittsburgh site that right

1262
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:42,340
besides Pittsburgh site oh and they'll

1263
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:44,740
be available and I think so or email me

1264
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:48,839
and I will send them out wonderful

1265
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:57,250
right but if you want the actual slides

1266
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:59,020
well hyperlinks you can just email me I

1267
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:00,880
will send them to you that's probably

1268
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:05,310
the easiest way wonderful thank you yeah

1269
00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:12,190
hey John um so I'm currently in the

1270
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:15,640
process of building up my own lab but

1271
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,410
right now I'm kind of cash-strapped in

1272
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:21,040
space straps so what should I be getting

1273
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,540
myself a desktop so I can have a little

1274
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:24,940
bit more power and it or should I be

1275
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:27,910
getting a laptop and then Linux should I

1276
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:30,040
be going after Callie or what Boone C or

1277
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:34,090
any other version work as well what

1278
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:37,260
skills are you trying to develop I

1279
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:39,730
started out doing auditing and

1280
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:41,859
compliance but now trapped into doing

1281
00:48:41,859 --> 00:48:45,790
more like pen testing CTFs just for fun

1282
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:47,830
and career advancement so so you'll

1283
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:50,800
probably want one computer that can run

1284
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,710
Kali Linux either natively just install

1285
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:56,230
it or in a VM and you'll need another

1286
00:48:56,230 --> 00:48:58,570
computer to probably run like a one at

1287
00:48:58,570 --> 00:49:01,780
least one basic VM so you can hack and

1288
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:03,490
use all the tools and Metasploit against

1289
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:05,770
that other box you can try to do it on

1290
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:08,109
one box but then that box has to be able

1291
00:49:08,109 --> 00:49:10,450
to run multiple virtual machines so it

1292
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:12,790
may be cheaper to get to get less

1293
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:15,460
expensive hardware all right and like

1294
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:17,619
$150 a laptop or something or whatever

1295
00:49:17,619 --> 00:49:19,359
is available on Craigslist or freecycle

1296
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:22,119
or something like that and just like

1297
00:49:22,119 --> 00:49:23,740
sort of the install an operating system

1298
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:26,140
and go go whack it a whole bunch of

1299
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:27,970
times and see what it's like to to break

1300
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:30,609
in or scan it and things like that so

1301
00:49:30,609 --> 00:49:32,859
you know you'll just need at least one

1302
00:49:32,859 --> 00:49:35,050
computer that can run Kali probably

1303
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:37,090
because that's really where where you'll

1304
00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:39,010
learn all the pen testing and red

1305
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:41,740
teaming tools not every pen test and Red

1306
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:43,300
Team tools in Kali but it is basically

1307
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:45,040
where everyone should start I think

1308
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,710
because of the Metasploit suite in

1309
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:50,920
particular that's commonly used by pen

1310
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:53,800
testing teams as the core the core

1311
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:56,130
operating system they're going to use

1312
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:58,960
there's got to be hopefully some cheap

1313
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,000
stuff either in free cycle Craigslist or

1314
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,850
Ebay so what you need at least one that

1315
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:05,530
will run Kali but it might be cheaper to

1316
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:08,180
actually have two cheap machines

1317
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:10,130
then one that will run multiple virtual

1318
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:12,890
machines and one more question if I may

1319
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:16,099
um you mentioned you work for DoD should

1320
00:50:16,099 --> 00:50:18,140
I be focusing on getting a CompTIA like

1321
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,970
Network Plus or security plus if I'm

1322
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:22,010
trying to get into governments or should

1323
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:26,059
I be going for other certs sure so a lot

1324
00:50:26,059 --> 00:50:27,980
of DoD contracting and organizations

1325
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:30,710
require you to have a certain DoD 8570

1326
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:32,690
level certification you can google that

1327
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:35,420
online and look that up it may make

1328
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:37,279
sense to at least get a network plus or

1329
00:50:37,279 --> 00:50:40,819
a security plus certification but again

1330
00:50:40,819 --> 00:50:42,559
don't you don't have to spend all the

1331
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,789
money on the bootcamp either you can

1332
00:50:43,789 --> 00:50:45,289
self-study and then just try to take the

1333
00:50:45,289 --> 00:50:48,589
exam but it I think having some

1334
00:50:48,589 --> 00:50:50,059
certifications when you're trying to

1335
00:50:50,059 --> 00:50:52,010
change roles or really break in are

1336
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:55,069
still worthwhile right it some people

1337
00:50:55,069 --> 00:50:57,349
have different opinions about that but I

1338
00:50:57,349 --> 00:50:59,119
still think it shows that you you've

1339
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:01,250
done something you've obviously studied

1340
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:04,130
enough to go past the exam which means

1341
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:05,599
you should have some sort of baseline

1342
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:09,500
level of information so I I is someone

1343
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,910
who hires people looks at all of the

1344
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:13,609
things including certifications and on

1345
00:51:13,609 --> 00:51:15,230
your own studying and attending

1346
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:16,640
conferences and I try to take all of

1347
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,890
that into consideration so I think

1348
00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:20,930
there's more upside than downside to get

1349
00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:23,480
in that plus or suck plus still so thank

1350
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,819
you yeah I think we're about out of time

1351
00:51:25,819 --> 00:51:28,400
when somebody has a has a quick question

1352
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:29,630
I can answer in about a minute and a

1353
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:35,500
half yes

1354
00:51:47,410 --> 00:51:49,030
okay

1355
00:51:49,030 --> 00:51:52,090
yeah uh-oh so the comment was you could

1356
00:51:52,090 --> 00:51:54,790
use AWS or maybe other cloud instances

1357
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:56,860
to try to do some of this in my

1358
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:58,540
experience sometimes there's an

1359
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:00,220
intimidation factor with that that

1360
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:01,930
people just starting out in this field

1361
00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:03,820
have but that's another option would be

1362
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:05,760
to use AWS or something like that

1363
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,720
alright if you guys have other questions

1364
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:10,180
I'll be around I don't believe it one

1365
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:12,510
last question maybe we got one minute

1366
00:52:12,510 --> 00:52:14,800
here real quick there used to be

1367
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,030
Microsoft used to offer server for

1368
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:20,440
technical people Technion I think was

1369
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:22,330
called right and they don't anymore any

1370
00:52:22,330 --> 00:52:23,920
recommendations on where to get cheap

1371
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:26,050
Windows server this handy collection of

1372
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:28,780
basic ISO files which so far I think is

1373
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:31,510
still available that I'm hosting if you

1374
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:33,490
have trouble with them I can repost

1375
00:52:33,490 --> 00:52:35,140
certain ones I don't know that I have

1376
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:37,900
the latest version of server but you can

1377
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:40,780
find server ISOs that are not loaded

1378
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:43,450
with malware still thanks thanks

1379
00:52:43,450 --> 00:52:46,180
absolutely all right thank you guys so

1380
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:46,720
much for coming

1381
