1
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:05,900
okay we're gonna go ahead and get

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,540
started so the next speaker is Dustin

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,460
Updike you'll be presenting on ghosts in

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,290
the machine orchestrating a realistic

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:15,110
cyber security exercise battlefield it's

6
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:16,910
a little bit about Dustin Dustin uptick

7
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:18,560
is a cyber security researcher at the

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,300
Carnegie Mellon University's assert

9
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,160
having previously served with multiple

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,779
industries an array of Technology roles

11
00:00:23,779 --> 00:00:25,730
dustin transition into security

12
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,079
supporting cyber workforce development

13
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:28,849
for multiple government and commercial

14
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:31,070
contracts his current interests are in

15
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,140
game theory machine learning and a

16
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,380
without further ado let's welcome Dustin

17
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:41,590
[Applause]

18
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,480
hi is this thing on okay sorry I'm a

19
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,550
stroller so I'm not gonna stand there at

20
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:47,780
the podium

21
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,940
thanks to besides for having me thanks

22
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,920
to all of you for coming out on Dustin

23
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,489
and originally this talk was going to be

24
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:57,950
about developing a software system that

25
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:01,040
would replicate human behavior on a

26
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,710
computer the good guys the bad guys

27
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,990
everything in between in a way that we

28
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:07,729
could use it for training and exercise

29
00:01:07,729 --> 00:01:10,340
those people learning different things

30
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:13,610
about the security industry but I

31
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:17,110
realized what who my team is what we do

32
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,120
and how we think are sort of critical to

33
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,070
understanding why we developed this

34
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:24,560
software and how we did it so you get

35
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,060
both of those stories because I don't

36
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,440
think one makes sense without the other

37
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,120
and that's what we're going to go

38
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,760
through today so of course everything I

39
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,090
say today is not necessarily the

40
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,500
opinions of my employer of the

41
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:42,409
University so my job is to be interested

42
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:44,990
in workforce development particularly in

43
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:49,640
the realm of cyber and security that

44
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,950
landscape we'll walk through today how

45
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,260
it's going to change how we anticipate

46
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,970
it's a change in the next couple of

47
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,040
years and what that might look like and

48
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,930
what the implications are for that

49
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:03,850
change now the TLDR of this talk is that

50
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:06,470
everything that we do in terms of

51
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:09,739
training should be rooted in some sort

52
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:11,930
of realistic scenario right so to borrow

53
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,620
a phrase from the military we want to

54
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,730
train as we fight

55
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:21,090
and so the the exercises and the

56
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,709
training that we put together and I'll

57
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:24,959
walk you through today the number one

58
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,330
pillar that we try to always stay on

59
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:30,180
course for is to deliver something that

60
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,470
people would see in their daily

61
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:34,290
operations and for them to do the sorts

62
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,060
of things that they do in their day job

63
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,500
right and the thinking there is if

64
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,360
you've done it enough times in training

65
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,790
you'll know exactly what to do when that

66
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,390
situation arises in real life correct if

67
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,640
you don't do that then we find that's a

68
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,019
great place to pick up lots of bad

69
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:50,940
habits right if you're gaming

70
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,860
your training you're probably not

71
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,430
getting the most out of it

72
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:59,040
so in terms of realism this is where we

73
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,360
have to start does anybody recognize

74
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,700
this yeah so this is the planet amine

75
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,390
er7

76
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,360
it's from episode 23 of the first season

77
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,829
of Star Trek the original one and so the

78
00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:16,230
crew the enterprise goes there and finds

79
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,510
that the planet has been locked in war

80
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:21,090
for 500 years except there's no

81
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,180
destruction there's no chaos there's not

82
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,060
really any sign of armed conflict at all

83
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,190
so it turns out that the entire war has

84
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,230
been fought in a computer simulation for

85
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:34,920
500 years the the caveat is that if

86
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,170
you're killed in the simulation you must

87
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,180
submit yourself to a disintegrator and

88
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,220
sort of kill yourself in real life right

89
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,530
so that's a pretty realistic simulation

90
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,139
right that's not what we aspire to do

91
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:47,670
right we're not trying to build Skynet

92
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,620
or something like this but I think it's

93
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,329
a very interesting question how far

94
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:52,709
should we go in terms of building

95
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:54,900
training that mimics what you're going

96
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,139
to do in your day job it's probably

97
00:03:58,139 --> 00:03:59,910
short of this right but it's probably

98
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,310
not the basic stuff that you can read

99
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,970
out of a textbook either so yeah that's

100
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:09,660
a Meany r7 and I got some cool suits so

101
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:14,329
as part of our simulation we wrote a

102
00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:16,829
package that's that's a that's a little

103
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,889
bit down the stack so assume we're doing

104
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:21,478
some sort of network training we have a

105
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:23,490
network and there's lots of tools to do

106
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,650
that right on ESXi or some other

107
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,500
hypervisor we have an internet and it's

108
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,610
probably in a box right it probably

109
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:30,660
isn't the actual

110
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,160
Internet that's outside and again

111
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,370
there's tools for that so now we need

112
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,450
activity on that wire right we need

113
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:40,230
users quote unquote I don't like to use

114
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,240
users not not for anything but because

115
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,610
user sim isn't is not a new thing right

116
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:45,960
there's lots of tools out there that

117
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,480
does that but it's a range of things and

118
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,650
we want to be a little bit more precise

119
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,080
in what that is so there there's there

120
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,480
specialized hardware that puts packets

121
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,700
on a wire there they're highly realistic

122
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,500
packets but they don't track back to any

123
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,140
particular machine at the other end of

124
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,880
the spectrum and the sei is actually

125
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,520
done some work in this area we can

126
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,640
automate Windows or Linux or something

127
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,530
like that to do certain things so that

128
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:12,420
it looks like a user is on that box

129
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,460
right

130
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,760
we took that model and we we went with

131
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,210
it

132
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,710
we added a bunch of things that we

133
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,600
hadn't seen in the market before and

134
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,250
again this is not a this is not a sales

135
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,580
talk right but we we added a couple of

136
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,470
features we added the network effect so

137
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,970
that we could command and coordinate

138
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,940
large number of VMs to do certain types

139
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,880
of user behavior either as an enclave as

140
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,680
a group of machines or as a single

141
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,780
machine so at the end of the day we're

142
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,970
able to model all different types of

143
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,520
human behavior on a box and if it was

144
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,080
done really really well you wouldn't

145
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,450
know whether it was me or a computer

146
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,610
simulation of me sitting at the other

147
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:54,390
end of the cable so does everybody have

148
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,370
in mind that person back home on their

149
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,840
network that's super annoying that

150
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,730
clicks on everything that launches like

151
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,440
everything you're not supposed to do

152
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,180
right we could we could actually model

153
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,190
those people with ghosts because you

154
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:07,020
probably have those people that you have

155
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,270
to deal with in your organization now

156
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,800
you can model them and make fun of them

157
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,330
and even give them names right because

158
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,700
they have a user name on your network so

159
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,600
they can have some fun with that as well

160
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,910
so this is sort of the last group that I

161
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,800
need to poke a stick at and say you know

162
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,030
you should be scared there's lots of

163
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:26,280
scary things in the world the point I

164
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,840
want to make is that the scary things

165
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,940
are rapidly increasing right the number

166
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,890
of attacks the sophistication of those

167
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,200
attacks the things that we are seeing

168
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,870
today are largely unseen in the past and

169
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,340
the the thing that a lot of people

170
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,780
forget is that training needs to keep

171
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,980
pace with that

172
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,320
right if we're seeing more sophisticated

173
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,840
attacks that include larger sets of data

174
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,730
that includes machine learning systems

175
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,470
we need to figure out how to build that

176
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,120
my team needs to figure out how to build

177
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,600
that in training and make it affordable

178
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,120
and not super resource intensive and not

179
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,620
custom for every single client that

180
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,050
comes down the path right so that keep

181
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:08,010
that in the back of your mind we do all

182
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:11,160
different sorts of training events I'll

183
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,800
call them training it for our purposes

184
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,140
we'll be sort of a one-on-one thing I

185
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,180
need to learn Python I need to learn the

186
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:18,750
bash shell

187
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,850
I'll eat I need to learn basic

188
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:23,040
networking cloud architecture those are

189
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,080
the things you normally go off and do on

190
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,500
your own in whichever medium suits you

191
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,000
best right you can you can get a book

192
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,370
you can do the audio book you can heck

193
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,260
you can go to youtube and probably learn

194
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,210
it in an afternoon right from some 13

195
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:40,170
year old incur blackest tan we also do

196
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:42,750
exercises which i think is super

197
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,340
interesting because I don't know that

198
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,220
they exist very often in the commercial

199
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:51,720
non military world so an exercise is I

200
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,600
guess the best analogy for it is if we

201
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,000
were an elite soccer team and we had a

202
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,710
game this weekend I think someone is

203
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,250
playing right now right what's the score

204
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,080
if we wanted to know how we were going

205
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,030
to do the best predictor of how we were

206
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,860
going to do is to play a scrimmage game

207
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,990
against a team that is most like the

208
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,760
team were actually going to play right

209
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,210
use the same equipment the same rules

210
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,950
and go out there and try to win and that

211
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,240
would give us some baseline of what

212
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,770
we're good at at what we need to improve

213
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:23,490
upon etc that's an exercise that can't

214
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:25,200
be done in a drill right in a drill you

215
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,420
can stop and tie your shoe in a

216
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,740
scrimmage game and you don't want to

217
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,600
lose you have to be prepared for those

218
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,700
sorts of things so the military does

219
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,070
exercises all the time right that proves

220
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:38,039
that units are our combat ready

221
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:41,549
cyber teams do that just the same and I

222
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:43,200
don't see that in the in the consumer

223
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,880
world too often but it's really

224
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,740
interesting because the dichotomy there

225
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,170
is everybody has a job to do but they

226
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,090
also have to operate as some sort of

227
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:53,310
team right and guess what a lot of us

228
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,290
operate as a team so how do you train

229
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,240
and improve

230
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,610
and even baseline where you're at in

231
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,380
your organization if teams don't train

232
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,470
together and then simulations are of

233
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,029
course they're just automating the whole

234
00:09:06,029 --> 00:09:08,580
thing looking at the result data set to

235
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,810
make some assumptions or some

236
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:11,250
predictions about how it might be in the

237
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,800
future now for all of these we we do a

238
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,220
certain set of of things starting with

239
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,529
the network right we build highly

240
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:21,330
realistic or as realistic as possible

241
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,670
networks that match what people are

242
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,350
using in their production environments

243
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,630
it might be the whole thing it might be

244
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,490
a subset of what we want to train upon

245
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:32,279
but we use the same tools and products

246
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:34,980
that they would use in production you

247
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,930
know cost not being a factor sometimes

248
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:39,510
that sort of changes the dynamic a

249
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,730
little bit but but for most part we're

250
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,470
using the actual tool tools that they're

251
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,810
using in production then on top of that

252
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:48,089
we layer different types of scenarios so

253
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:52,020
it might be to try new some new hunt

254
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:55,290
technique that DCO is is is interested

255
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,330
in it might be to validate that their

256
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,370
internal processes and communications

257
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,829
are up to snuff maybe there are a couple

258
00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:03,000
of years old and they want to take a

259
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,779
look at that maybe it's to assert that

260
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:09,300
soldiers are meeting their mettle which

261
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,430
is that third line that's an interesting

262
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,649
term it's a military term it's a mission

263
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:15,750
essential task list it's typically not

264
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,329
tied to knowing the tool or knowing a

265
00:10:18,329 --> 00:10:20,730
process it's basically can you get this

266
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,980
thing done under a high / high duress

267
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,750
right and I always think that that's

268
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,550
kind of interesting because that's not

269
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,200
how we hire or how we fill out our

270
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,300
resumes right we put I have 10 years of

271
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,220
Python experience I know how to use

272
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,140
plunk and that's what we get hired for

273
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,850
right the military says no we don't

274
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,470
really care so much how you do it

275
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,360
there's there's outcomes that we want to

276
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,740
see and you need to be able to do it

277
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,329
quickly obviously we have to work with

278
00:10:42,329 --> 00:10:44,399
the stakeholders on that side to figure

279
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,649
out how we can validate those

280
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:48,480
assessments and time it and all that

281
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,790
sort of thing some of the more fun

282
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,170
things that we get to do is to actually

283
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:54,630
roleplay the different characters that

284
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:58,079
are in the exercise that might be some

285
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:59,820
headquarters that is telling you what to

286
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,790
do it might be some Intel Group either

287
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,000
inside or outside of your organization

288
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,770
providing you some direction it might be

289
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:10,590
a super grumpy contractor from lock

290
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,480
that's pissed off that his machine you

291
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,090
turned his machine off somehow so we get

292
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:16,529
really into character and we have a lot

293
00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:19,110
of fun with those the funnest of all of

294
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,790
them is when we get to play Red Team

295
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,760
right in military terms that's up for

296
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,990
sometimes we get to do that sometimes

297
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,460
another group does that when the other

298
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,200
group does that that's just another set

299
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,210
of requirements for us they are

300
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:33,029
typically not the ones being evaluated

301
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:35,850
in an exercise so they're part of

302
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:38,339
assessing providing the tools for

303
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:40,890
assessment of the actual blue team we

304
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:44,820
work a lot with blue team's and then a

305
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,620
point that I would like to make is that

306
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:49,500
the exercise can be facilitated meaning

307
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,960
we're they're either virtually or face

308
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,270
to face or it couldn't be completely on

309
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:56,880
demand where you sort of go into the

310
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,160
system you pick this scenario and then

311
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,950
everything is controlled by the computer

312
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:05,040
and of course that is directly linked to

313
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,170
building ghosts and we'll get to that in

314
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:11,810
a second so when we do the red teaming

315
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:15,210
my my team always sort of scoffs at

316
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:16,950
these are these on-demand exercise

317
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:18,690
there's nothing you can do on a computer

318
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:20,070
that's as good as we are we're making

319
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:23,520
all sorts of gut decisions we're reading

320
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,500
all these different data points that

321
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,870
would be all that's impossible to

322
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,850
replicate with with any kind of

323
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,110
programming right that just can't be

324
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:34,980
done I'm a software developer so that is

325
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,780
a really juicy statement to launch in

326
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:39,630
front of me I get excited about what I

327
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:40,920
love when people say that's impossible

328
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,720
right because I want to get started on

329
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,089
that like tomorrow how can I was there a

330
00:12:45,089 --> 00:12:47,880
charged string for that but over and

331
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,500
over people have made this statement and

332
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,050
it's kind of interesting because at the

333
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,910
same time I was reading ready player one

334
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:56,310
I haven't seen the movie and most people

335
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:59,339
say that I shouldn't bother but the book

336
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:01,589
is interesting because you you jack into

337
00:13:01,589 --> 00:13:03,330
the Oasis just like you go into these

338
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:06,450
different scenarios and you you you take

339
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,910
on some task right and at the other end

340
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:11,490
of the task is some thinking adversary

341
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,680
that you have to sort of battle it out

342
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,430
with right I will admit that most on

343
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,700
well not most all on-demand exercises

344
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,040
for anyone of a certain skill set they

345
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,209
start to get they

346
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:25,949
feel very gaming right and you start to

347
00:13:25,949 --> 00:13:27,529
take those shortcuts that we don't like

348
00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:30,149
because it's you know it's not realistic

349
00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:32,759
it's not using the right tools it's for

350
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:34,019
vm's and we're calling that an

351
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:35,699
enterprise network whatever the reason

352
00:13:35,699 --> 00:13:41,160
might be so so that you know that's a

353
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,139
place for us to improve right there's a

354
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:44,970
lot of opportunity to make those better

355
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:47,220
and if I could make an exercise that my

356
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,869
team would be challenged by like that

357
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,029
would be something that would help not

358
00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:55,579
only more experienced cyber experts to

359
00:13:55,579 --> 00:13:58,559
improve and practice new things but that

360
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:00,119
would allow our military to use it etc

361
00:14:00,119 --> 00:14:03,240
etc etc so that's not a new idea right a

362
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,579
thinking adversaries been around for for

363
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:07,829
a long time does anybody remember this

364
00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:09,899
movie I'm not dating I'm dating myself

365
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:13,110
but you know again this is not a new

366
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,790
idea there's lots of reasons that it

367
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,379
hasn't been done right the sheer

368
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:18,420
complexity of being a network

369
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:22,410
administrator the the amount of data

370
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:24,119
that you would have to have on that

371
00:14:24,119 --> 00:14:26,850
exercise being able to make good

372
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:28,860
decisions based on that data that's

373
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:34,559
coming in etc etc etc so yeah so that's

374
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:36,809
the challenge that was sort of the thing

375
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,209
that got us thinking about automating

376
00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:41,850
our users and the good guys and the bad

377
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,379
guys and everything in between and

378
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:46,670
that's sort of the context for it now we

379
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:49,679
we do these exercises right and and I

380
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:52,649
want to veer off for a second and talk

381
00:14:52,649 --> 00:14:54,839
about that team thing right to me

382
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:56,819
cybersecurity is a team exercise there

383
00:14:56,819 --> 00:14:58,860
aren't very many people out there that

384
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,170
are lone guns doing something without

385
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:04,199
any other organization that they're

386
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:06,209
interacting with and that's an

387
00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:08,100
interesting dichotomy because there's

388
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,600
certain skills that you and I have to

389
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,100
have right if we go back to the soccer

390
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,189
analogy we've got to be in peak physical

391
00:15:14,189 --> 00:15:16,709
condition right to be able to run for 10

392
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:18,990
miles in a soccer game we need to be

393
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:21,869
able to not only know our position but

394
00:15:21,869 --> 00:15:23,699
all the other positions around us on the

395
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:25,049
team right where is everybody going to

396
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,610
be when we have the ball where's

397
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:27,959
everybody going to be when we don't have

398
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,119
the ball so we can get it back in and be

399
00:15:30,119 --> 00:15:32,689
back on the attack

400
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:35,309
but then and so we we all do that right

401
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,350
we all train we all learn new things we

402
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:37,660
all

403
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,370
or buying books and listening to

404
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,350
podcasts and all that sort of thing but

405
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,970
again back to that that team thing

406
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:44,920
there's not a lot of opportunities for

407
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,970
teams to train together and sort of

408
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,860
focus on the dynamics of the team and

409
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,899
less on what what each individual

410
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:57,040
component is doing so if you think about

411
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,660
it like how do you how can you say that

412
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,990
your DCO is a great DCO and is effective

413
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,459
in its job if you've never trained them

414
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:06,069
if you have no baseline for it as an

415
00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:07,720
aside I suspect that the commercial

416
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,220
world does not do that because they

417
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,990
might be very disappointed with the

418
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:13,180
results and therefore somehow are liable

419
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,839
for it I don't know right but but it's

420
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:18,670
but it's an interesting thing that we

421
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:21,550
don't see very often outside of our DoD

422
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:25,449
partners now this is a say it's it's

423
00:16:25,449 --> 00:16:27,160
really it's actually not that hard right

424
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,139
there are five areas that we typically

425
00:16:29,139 --> 00:16:31,870
concentrate on for even the most

426
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:34,180
unsophisticated exercise that gives

427
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,610
teams opportunities to baseline and say

428
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:39,100
hey we're doing very good at this hey

429
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,730
our SOP is is entirely adequate even

430
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,949
though it's five years old so as long as

431
00:16:44,949 --> 00:16:47,350
we are clear about what roles people are

432
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,639
playing and they're the same and the

433
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,069
exercise as they are in real life

434
00:16:51,069 --> 00:16:53,649
the tactics and the adversaries that

435
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:55,540
we're dealing with are realistic to what

436
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,939
our job is so if we do an exercise where

437
00:16:57,939 --> 00:16:59,709
we're defending webservers and I don't

438
00:16:59,709 --> 00:17:02,800
actually have that in in my in my daily

439
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,470
operations back at company X that's not

440
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:08,709
really helpful right communication is an

441
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:10,480
interesting one because it's an easy way

442
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,099
to practice like hey we've identified

443
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:14,230
something how fast can we turn around

444
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,929
and do something about this and mitigate

445
00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:18,819
some threat or some vulnerability that's

446
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:21,849
just been announced and that environment

447
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:23,799
is also an interesting one if a team

448
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:25,809
sits together we train them together if

449
00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:27,220
they don't sit together we don't let

450
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,110
them sit together right so that they get

451
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:32,020
used to how things are actually on the

452
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:36,880
company floor on the technology side we

453
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,130
again we install all the tools that they

454
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,750
would expect to see and they use every

455
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,940
day I assume at some point they're an

456
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,710
expert on that tool so let's put it into

457
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,840
training so that they can they can show

458
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,970
that off a bit so if we're using Cisco

459
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,809
routers we put them in in game

460
00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:53,029
as well I will admit that licensing is a

461
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:55,009
huge pain in the neck right right in the

462
00:17:55,009 --> 00:17:57,649
middle the exercise it like never fails

463
00:17:57,649 --> 00:17:59,960
that the Cisco licensing goes down and

464
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,690
everything slows to a crawl and and

465
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:04,519
everybody sort of slaps their forehead

466
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:07,730
but replacing it with some other router

467
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:09,710
severely handicapped so those teams and

468
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:12,710
we try to avoid it likewise for the red

469
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:16,070
team we try to make it so that they're

470
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:18,409
able to do all of the things that they

471
00:18:18,409 --> 00:18:21,309
want to do in that than that scenario

472
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:24,169
sometimes that means before the exercise

473
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:25,279
starts we have to have a conversation

474
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:28,190
with blue team's about letting

475
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,249
PowerShell execute or letting off on

476
00:18:31,249 --> 00:18:33,409
some GP oh right but that's an

477
00:18:33,409 --> 00:18:35,600
understood game ISM and they're sort of

478
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,399
okay with that the worst possible thing

479
00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:39,769
is when the cyber ghost comes in at some

480
00:18:39,769 --> 00:18:42,320
predetermined time put some payload on a

481
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,149
machine that nobody can explain how it

482
00:18:44,149 --> 00:18:46,490
got there or why it's there and then all

483
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:48,470
of a sudden hell breaks loose and teams

484
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,389
are like wow I was really realistic

485
00:18:50,389 --> 00:18:51,590
that's great where did that come from

486
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:55,149
right so we we really avoid that and and

487
00:18:55,149 --> 00:18:57,559
work hard to make it a more realistic

488
00:18:57,559 --> 00:18:59,570
hey this is how this got inside the wall

489
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,940
and you can find that in the logs you

490
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,769
can see that in the network traffic etc

491
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:07,700
etc of course for a red team they have a

492
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,519
host of different personas that they're

493
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:12,259
going to use in that scenario might be a

494
00:19:12,259 --> 00:19:14,350
hostile nation state I saw someone with

495
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,399
with the t-shirt with these three

496
00:19:16,399 --> 00:19:19,720
characters on such a cool t-shirt but

497
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,070
right all these all these different

498
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,690
personas have different motivations

499
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:26,059
different strategies about how they're

500
00:19:26,059 --> 00:19:28,669
going to attack and death of course

501
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:30,289
that's different opportunities for teams

502
00:19:30,289 --> 00:19:32,210
to learn about what that's going to look

503
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:34,369
like in the real world how to identify

504
00:19:34,369 --> 00:19:37,850
it how to mitigate it and for our

505
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:39,649
software's purposes we would want to be

506
00:19:39,649 --> 00:19:41,499
able to recreate all of these different

507
00:19:41,499 --> 00:19:48,289
personas in our exercise right so let's

508
00:19:48,289 --> 00:19:50,840
get down to the to the software the

509
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,519
software is called ghosts it's open

510
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:55,100
source it's out on github right now I do

511
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,200
all the development out there all the

512
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,090
bugs are are plain to see

513
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:02,539
all the feature requests are as well we

514
00:20:02,539 --> 00:20:05,019
have used it for the last two years

515
00:20:05,019 --> 00:20:07,399
operationally that's our our test ground

516
00:20:07,399 --> 00:20:09,950
some of these bigger exercises are using

517
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:13,460
multiples of thousands of characters in

518
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,649
game and we're able to support that with

519
00:20:15,649 --> 00:20:18,799
a with a pretty simple stack but it's

520
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,029
out there check it out if you're

521
00:20:20,029 --> 00:20:21,919
interested in building your own sort of

522
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,080
training environment we have a lot of

523
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,940
tools to help you do that quickly and

524
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:30,950
easily for for any kind of exercise or

525
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,809
training typically we have interactions

526
00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:35,179
between humans that's us right and then

527
00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:37,220
these characters that are represented in

528
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:40,070
game as NPCs to borrow a term from from

529
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,809
D&D right that's any that's any

530
00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:43,429
character in the game that's controlled

531
00:20:43,429 --> 00:20:45,409
by the computer and again if ghost is

532
00:20:45,409 --> 00:20:47,059
gonna do it really well you won't be

533
00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:49,970
able to tell which is which right they

534
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,649
need to be behaviorally accurate that

535
00:20:51,649 --> 00:20:54,080
means Todd and logistics needs to be

536
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,970
doing logistic e types of things

537
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:57,799
browsing certain websites filling out

538
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:59,869
certain types of documents sending

539
00:20:59,869 --> 00:21:02,659
emails to certain types of people versus

540
00:21:02,659 --> 00:21:03,769
someone over in marketing or

541
00:21:03,769 --> 00:21:07,070
communications or etc etc so that's

542
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,600
really an infinite array of

543
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,489
configurations that you'd that you'd

544
00:21:10,489 --> 00:21:11,809
want to have right you want to have that

545
00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:14,090
real enterprise-e level configuration

546
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:18,139
mess that we try to avoid but in in no

547
00:21:18,139 --> 00:21:20,929
short order is sort of necessary and of

548
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:22,340
course they need to be fully autonomous

549
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,919
in a in a long-running exercises some of

550
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:27,739
ours are are over nine months we're not

551
00:21:27,739 --> 00:21:29,090
gonna go in and tinker with them right

552
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:30,499
we might reconfigure them or whatever

553
00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:33,649
but but we don't have to restart them or

554
00:21:33,649 --> 00:21:35,989
do anything like that so if we were able

555
00:21:35,989 --> 00:21:37,850
to do that if we were able to replicate

556
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:39,889
the the people that we're there to

557
00:21:39,889 --> 00:21:41,960
protect bless you and the people that

558
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,119
are coming in from the outside scanning

559
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:45,980
our networks looking for vulnerabilities

560
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,559
right that would be kind of like real

561
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:49,970
life and that would give our

562
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:52,309
participants higher training value and

563
00:21:52,309 --> 00:21:54,799
of course we correlate that with hey if

564
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,480
you're doing exactly what you're doing

565
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,239
in operations in your training you're

566
00:21:59,239 --> 00:22:01,429
gonna know how to react that should be

567
00:22:01,429 --> 00:22:02,989
successive that should that should

568
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:05,389
result in better chance of success in

569
00:22:05,389 --> 00:22:08,600
the real world than not so the

570
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,309
technology behind ghosts is a simple

571
00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:13,099
client-server architecture the server

572
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:14,929
we've been working over and over again

573
00:22:14,929 --> 00:22:16,429
to make it as simple as possible to

574
00:22:16,429 --> 00:22:18,169
stand up right now it's three doctor

575
00:22:18,169 --> 00:22:20,269
containers so docker compose up and

576
00:22:20,269 --> 00:22:25,210
you're ready to roll and the clients are

577
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,470
approaching that that level of ease as

578
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:29,119
well their zip file they don't require

579
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:30,799
any special permissions or any kind of

580
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,470
install scripts put it in a folder run

581
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,989
it as that user and it should be good to

582
00:22:35,989 --> 00:22:37,879
go there's a little bit of configuration

583
00:22:37,879 --> 00:22:40,100
to get the - to talk of course but other

584
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,289
than that you should be good initially

585
00:22:42,289 --> 00:22:44,299
they will get their instructions from

586
00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:46,669
the command server including who am i

587
00:22:46,669 --> 00:22:49,879
representing right I'm Tony from from

588
00:22:49,879 --> 00:22:51,859
marketing and here is my list of

589
00:22:51,859 --> 00:22:53,690
timeline events that I'm gonna do

590
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:55,340
throughout a day I'm gonna browse these

591
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,629
websites I'm gonna fill out these

592
00:22:56,629 --> 00:22:58,639
documents every so often I'll respond to

593
00:22:58,639 --> 00:23:02,059
email etc and I did and of course we can

594
00:23:02,059 --> 00:23:04,070
update that throughout the exercise for

595
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:06,950
the entire exercise for groups of

596
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:10,249
machines or one machine at a time in

597
00:23:10,249 --> 00:23:12,499
addition to that the agents are starting

598
00:23:12,499 --> 00:23:14,239
to learn about where they're sitting on

599
00:23:14,239 --> 00:23:16,340
the network as well so we call it the

600
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:19,369
coffee counter effect if we took any one

601
00:23:19,369 --> 00:23:21,320
of us and put us in a new company on

602
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,970
Monday right we start to figure some

603
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,950
things out we even with the least

604
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:26,539
permissions we'd be able to figure some

605
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:28,460
things out like what's my upstream

606
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,379
Network look like what file shares are

607
00:23:30,379 --> 00:23:32,419
available what printers are out here

608
00:23:32,419 --> 00:23:34,759
what other machines are around me in

609
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:36,320
addition we probably go get a drink at

610
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,239
some point coffee water whatever right

611
00:23:38,239 --> 00:23:39,919
and we be like hey Chris where do you

612
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,720
work what are you doing today right and

613
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,669
we start to figure out who sits around

614
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:46,730
us and what they do right so all of that

615
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:50,210
information the agents use the agents

616
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:52,669
clients use to reason about what to do

617
00:23:52,669 --> 00:23:54,559
next so you gave me these sort of

618
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,629
guardrails of things to do throughout

619
00:23:56,629 --> 00:23:59,149
the day but I'm going to pick what is is

620
00:23:59,149 --> 00:24:01,820
is next for me on my list unless we

621
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,440
specifically program it to do one two

622
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,330
three right which is which is not kind

623
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:07,869
of real-world that we're looking for

624
00:24:07,869 --> 00:24:10,730
typical install for us is to put the

625
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:12,889
control server out of game across the

626
00:24:12,889 --> 00:24:15,019
hypervisor we have a technology called V

627
00:24:15,019 --> 00:24:18,799
tunnel you install on ESXi and it

628
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,539
tunnels all of the traffic from the

629
00:24:20,539 --> 00:24:22,639
clients so that players can't see it

630
00:24:22,639 --> 00:24:24,679
that's actually important because really

631
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:26,389
good players will see that traffic and

632
00:24:26,389 --> 00:24:27,769
they'll start to take a look right

633
00:24:27,769 --> 00:24:30,410
they'll use any edge they can to win

634
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:32,780
and I don't blame them right but we use

635
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,280
this v tunnel to hide it so they don't

636
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,320
see it at all so there's nothing on the

637
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,940
clients that you can look at that would

638
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,070
tell you oh this is this is a this is

639
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,690
something good and this is something bad

640
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:43,670
right so let's watch over here that

641
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:45,470
doesn't exist and we hide all the

642
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:47,810
traffic back and forth that gives us the

643
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:50,030
opportunity to do a lot of different

644
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,460
things so blue team can set up however

645
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,570
they want they can set up their

646
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:55,700
firewalls there they can divide up their

647
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,980
networks however they want they want to

648
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,420
do that ghost doesn't care about any of

649
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,560
that it just stands up and starts

650
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,900
running as long as it has permissions to

651
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:06,590
run as the user it's good to go same

652
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,090
thing for the red team they can organize

653
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:11,210
by they could stand up boxes that do

654
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,890
different parts of the kill chain right

655
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:14,810
I have these bunch of boxes over here

656
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:16,940
doing recon and when they find something

657
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:19,340
they're gonna send that over to the next

658
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,920
phase which is going to look to exploit

659
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,360
some vulnerability that's been found

660
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,970
right and then of course we can do stuff

661
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:27,950
in the middle so that the red team can

662
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:31,250
either attack directly they can MIT can

663
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:33,410
cover my Sun box in the middle and and

664
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:36,290
do a jump or we can do insider threat

665
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:38,240
right the sei has done a ton of work in

666
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,970
s in insider threat and we can represent

667
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:43,190
the the malicious plant that would

668
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:44,660
that's like a foreign nation spy is

669
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,490
putting responder and all sort of nasty

670
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:49,520
stuff on the network or we can have you

671
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,530
know that person that we were talking

672
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:53,240
about before that clicks on everything

673
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,680
and just keeps clicking and just keeps

674
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,480
getting themselves further down the hole

675
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,020
we can do any one of those things so I'm

676
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,970
going to do a demo and I apologize

677
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:04,490
distributed systems are sort of hard to

678
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:07,310
demo but we'll go through it so you get

679
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:10,970
a flavor of what it looks like so this

680
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,860
is the Windows client right it fires up

681
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:16,370
as the user once it installs it's going

682
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:19,430
to it installs itself and then it goes

683
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:22,400
off and hides and starts to get to work

684
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,530
on the configuration that we've given it

685
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:26,270
so you can see it's firing up different

686
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:28,660
office documents it's going to pull up

687
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:32,930
Word Word Excel PowerPoint and going to

688
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:34,670
start sending and responding to emails

689
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:36,680
now there's no browser so the

690
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,810
configuration let's change that it's all

691
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:41,510
JSON text files you can go in and and do

692
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:43,130
it here you can do it on the server and

693
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:44,559
send it down

694
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,299
the browser is actually running in

695
00:26:46,299 --> 00:26:47,980
headless mode because for larger

696
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,620
thousand VM enclaves that's pretty

697
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,750
resource intensive so we run it headless

698
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:55,390
so I changed that file I save it go says

699
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:58,090
oh I got new instructions to do and it's

700
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:00,880
gonna restart and start to perform those

701
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,090
new actions and there's the browser so

702
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:06,400
you can for all these configurations

703
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,260
that can be random right you can you can

704
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,960
browse HTTP HTTPS sites at random

705
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,970
you can browse them go to this site go

706
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:14,890
to this page download this payload unzip

707
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:17,590
it do something nasty but here we just

708
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,090
have a normal machine that's going to go

709
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:21,039
throughout the day create different

710
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,870
kinds of documents browse different web

711
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:27,070
sites and you know that creates a lot of

712
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:31,179
of realistic noise on the network that's

713
00:27:31,179 --> 00:27:33,250
just people doing their day jobs if I

714
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:34,840
wanted to fire off something that's a

715
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,700
one time I'm thoughtful I'm over here

716
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,260
doing all these different timeline of

717
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,299
events I can do that a couple different

718
00:27:40,299 --> 00:27:41,909
ways there's a drop box where I just

719
00:27:41,909 --> 00:27:45,399
paste in a script and it's gonna execute

720
00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:47,980
that script move it to the outbox as

721
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,690
completed here you see it's just running

722
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:52,120
PowerShell and unzipping some file I can

723
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,220
do that as many times as I want so now

724
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,750
you have a machine that's doing its

725
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,909
normal things of the day and then

726
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:00,309
someone stops by and says hey can you

727
00:28:00,309 --> 00:28:01,960
take a look at the zip file you can do

728
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,789
those sorts of scenarios as well and

729
00:28:03,789 --> 00:28:05,559
again you can do it here on the box but

730
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:06,909
you probably do it up at the command

731
00:28:06,909 --> 00:28:10,299
server send that to an API and ghosts

732
00:28:10,299 --> 00:28:11,919
will deliver it to the machines that you

733
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:13,929
indicate could be all of the machines

734
00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:16,539
could be some of the machines or it

735
00:28:16,539 --> 00:28:18,220
could be one machine all that

736
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,779
information gets logged up at the

737
00:28:19,779 --> 00:28:21,940
command server I have this really

738
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,190
cranked up so you can see a new Enclave

739
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:26,289
is coming online is checking in saying

740
00:28:26,289 --> 00:28:29,529
hey I'm here and reporting all of its

741
00:28:29,529 --> 00:28:31,659
activity so the top line is your macro

742
00:28:31,659 --> 00:28:34,330
numbers and that middle graph is well I

743
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:37,770
ran 15 PowerPoint documents today I did

744
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:40,690
35 emails I clicked on a bunch of things

745
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:43,539
and I ran these ten PowerShell commands

746
00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:47,559
so all of that gets logged if it's a

747
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,539
command where there's an expected

748
00:28:49,539 --> 00:28:51,520
payload you get that payload as well and

749
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,809
then you can do something with it so you

750
00:28:52,809 --> 00:28:54,730
can LS on a folder until something

751
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:55,510
happens

752
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:57,820
now if I show you one machine and the

753
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,200
command server that's really not that

754
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,240
exciting right what's exciting is when

755
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,070
you have a bajillion machines out there

756
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:05,620
doing all these random things that kind

757
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,300
of looks like a corporate network right

758
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:10,450
actually the best ghost installation I

759
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:11,980
can't tell you what they're doing right

760
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:14,440
just like I can't tell you what Joe

761
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,880
Schmoe is doing on a corporate network

762
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,750
on Tuesday morning at 10:15

763
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:25,030
that's pretty real so back to the back

764
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:27,610
to the admin dashboard for a sec again

765
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:30,010
the top line is the macro numbers this

766
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:32,110
is a nine month exercise that we did

767
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:35,200
where a team would exercise then they

768
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,660
would go into a sandbox period to sort

769
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:40,150
of respond to how they did adjust some

770
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:41,590
of their configurations put new things

771
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:43,780
in then we'd exercise again

772
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,390
then we sandbox we did that four times

773
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:50,620
but you can see at the top we get a an

774
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:53,560
overall picture of agents reporting in

775
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,330
this is the timeline of events that I've

776
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:57,610
done they also report in their health

777
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:59,830
statistics so you can configure hey

778
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:01,990
these clients need to be able to get out

779
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:03,580
to these internet sites they need these

780
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:06,490
permissions they need whatever and then

781
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:08,890
when they can't do one of those things

782
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,020
they'll report back as an alert right so

783
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,690
sometimes we see teams block whole 24's

784
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:14,980
or something like that

785
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,500
which is a sort of a game violation and

786
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,000
and this is a way that we get alerted

787
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,400
and then they poll as well just to say

788
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,290
hey I'm here is there anything new for

789
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:26,290
me to do the second line is just meant

790
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:28,630
to show that we can tune the activity

791
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:31,450
pretty precisely in terms of let's turn

792
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:33,760
up the amount of stuff that our users

793
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,160
are doing or let's turn it down at

794
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,690
different points throughout the exercise

795
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:40,180
and then the bottom line is just a slice

796
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:44,110
of in this particular time period we had

797
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:47,710
111 machines browsing Firefox for them

798
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:50,080
working on Excel documents clicking on

799
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,450
things running commands etc so you have

800
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,820
access to all that data row by row this

801
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:58,690
is just a rollup it's nice to have at at

802
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,400
the you know if you're facilitating an

803
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,380
exercise that here's what's going on and

804
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,780
everything is sort of happening as you

805
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,870
expect so as far as working on this

806
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:09,309
software like I said it's about

807
00:31:09,309 --> 00:31:11,049
years old we've worked through that I

808
00:31:11,049 --> 00:31:12,490
don't know why we picked a three-phase

809
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:15,009
approach maybe it sounded good or we saw

810
00:31:15,009 --> 00:31:17,649
it on some blog post but in the third

811
00:31:17,649 --> 00:31:19,240
year where we're sort of down there at

812
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,059
phase three we can deploy really large

813
00:31:22,059 --> 00:31:24,220
networks we can have them do all sorts

814
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,950
of random things on a machine that you

815
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:30,730
and I would do and we can get all that

816
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:32,529
information back that leaves us with

817
00:31:32,529 --> 00:31:34,809
this huge data set of everything that

818
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:37,509
basically happens in that exercise and

819
00:31:37,509 --> 00:31:39,879
so what we're looking at this summer is

820
00:31:39,879 --> 00:31:41,590
can we start to automate some of those

821
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:43,240
things that my team said we couldn't

822
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:46,029
automate so can we have machines that

823
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:49,119
are doing scans and then find something

824
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:50,710
that we can actually do something with

825
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:52,059
and trip that off to another machine

826
00:31:52,059 --> 00:31:53,679
that's going to try to take advantage of

827
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,869
it right that's where we're at this

828
00:31:55,869 --> 00:31:57,309
summer we have a couple people working

829
00:31:57,309 --> 00:31:59,139
on it I can't tell you that that's

830
00:31:59,139 --> 00:32:00,490
something we're gonna turn around next

831
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:02,080
year and come back here and say well we

832
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,820
have all these automated tools now to

833
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:06,820
attack other nations with like no it's

834
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,470
it's going to be a long process but if

835
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:09,940
we can start to make some progress with

836
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,919
that maybe in a few years we'll have

837
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:14,759
something that's worth talking about

838
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:17,019
because it would be totally awesome to

839
00:32:17,019 --> 00:32:19,600
have a simulation where experienced

840
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,700
players could go in and have have an

841
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,169
experience where they say hey that that

842
00:32:23,169 --> 00:32:24,549
was actually pretty challenging like

843
00:32:24,549 --> 00:32:26,679
that thing was who's not cheating right

844
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:27,759
we don't want to create something that

845
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:29,559
knows everything about everything but

846
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:31,119
hey this was pretty realistic and it was

847
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:33,279
pretty challenging it taught me some

848
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:37,029
places I need to improve and so that's

849
00:32:37,029 --> 00:32:40,450
sort of the lead-in to where we think

850
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:42,850
some things are going right training and

851
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:44,919
exercise should always be rooted in that

852
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:47,110
that next level thing right that's why

853
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:48,820
we're working on this so that we can

854
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:51,220
have teams be able to train on things

855
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,049
that are happening right now in the

856
00:32:53,049 --> 00:32:55,240
world or are about to happen or expect

857
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,580
it to happen right so the best exercise

858
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:00,009
is for us or when we see something in

859
00:33:00,009 --> 00:33:01,360
the news and we're able to get it in

860
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,129
there that week and teams are like wow

861
00:33:03,129 --> 00:33:04,600
now I know what that's going to look

862
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,669
like in the real world I can identify it

863
00:33:06,669 --> 00:33:08,590
and hopefully I can mitigate it before

864
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:10,269
you know we even have to deal with it

865
00:33:10,269 --> 00:33:13,029
but that's what training and exercise is

866
00:33:13,029 --> 00:33:14,860
about right it's not about training on

867
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,419
things that are five years old and

868
00:33:16,419 --> 00:33:19,090
learning to deal with things that five

869
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:21,610
year old way right that's fighting a new

870
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:23,020
battle with old tools and

871
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:26,650
I think we know how that turns out so

872
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:28,240
that's part of our problem part of our

873
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,430
problem is the sophistication of the

874
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:32,770
networks that everyone is managing and

875
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:35,530
securing is sort of outpacing our

876
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:37,620
ability to keep pace with it right or

877
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,880
keep up with it

878
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,950
that could be cost that could be

879
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,720
resources training is always sort of the

880
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,220
last thing that people want to pay for

881
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:48,250
right so we have to look at new ways to

882
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:52,240
recreate these hyper realistic scenarios

883
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,710
without breaking the bank and without

884
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:58,750
having to use a hundred people to do

885
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:01,330
every single one of them custom right

886
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,220
and so some of the things that we're

887
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,450
looking at is using machine learning

888
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:07,810
using shared resources to recreate that

889
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:11,380
now imagine if I know everything with

890
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:13,300
ghosts I essentially know everything in

891
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,179
an exercise that my NPCs are doing I

892
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,190
know the results of everything they're

893
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,780
doing so I sort of know that whole one

894
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:24,489
side of the exercise now maybe I can

895
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:27,219
provide my players feedback and work

896
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:30,909
like a custom experience for them based

897
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:32,620
on how they're moving through that

898
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,360
exercise it's like a it's like a

899
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,130
choose-your-own-adventure if we were

900
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:38,679
able to do that maybe we could we could

901
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:41,620
use that to bring higher fidelity to the

902
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,659
types of scenarios that we see right

903
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:45,418
maybe there's a way that we can reuse

904
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:47,980
some of the vulnerabilities and some of

905
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,899
the malware that we're using in

906
00:34:49,899 --> 00:34:51,340
different ways without having to write

907
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:55,750
it from scratch maybe if we could add

908
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:58,450
everything that the actual human players

909
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:00,940
were using to that are doing to that

910
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:03,220
data set then we'd really have something

911
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,810
right now I know basically everything

912
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:07,030
that's going on inside my exercise maybe

913
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:08,890
I can really give you feedback about

914
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:10,960
well this thing happened and you missed

915
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,820
it and now you know things are really

916
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:15,430
going wrong inside your network that

917
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:18,430
real-time that real-time feedback would

918
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:21,310
be sort of key to that jacking into the

919
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:22,900
Oasis and taking on this thinking

920
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,120
adversary in a way that actually helps

921
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:29,080
you get better as an operator and then

922
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,270
the last step of that is if we were

923
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:33,400
doing exercises that we're doing that

924
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,950
then why couldn't we just add a layer of

925
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:36,730
machine learning

926
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:39,250
on top of the exercise to tell you which

927
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:41,070
exercise you would get the most from

928
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:43,540
right how do you pick which scenario to

929
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:46,630
train on going back to the Vietnam slide

930
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:48,520
right you shouldn't train on things you

931
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,660
already know and things that you're

932
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:50,440
already good at

933
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,119
maybe you should train on this thing

934
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:54,010
here because we've detected some

935
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:57,760
weakness in the force right that's scary

936
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,290
right for this room that should be super

937
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:02,890
scary because what if we hooked what if

938
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:04,450
we hooked production systems to our

939
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:06,400
training environments like what if the

940
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,440
training was so good and so realistic

941
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,050
and so oasis like that we just took the

942
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:12,820
results of training to improve our

943
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:15,790
production systems what if we took our

944
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:17,410
production systems to build better

945
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:19,300
training modules because it would be

946
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,070
then based on the things that are

947
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:22,570
actually running in production now

948
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:25,000
that's crazy right that's a whole new

949
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,040
vector we are opening ourselves up to

950
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,140
attack how do you separate training data

951
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:31,060
from real data well what if the training

952
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:33,010
data was actually valuable in some way

953
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:34,950
that influenced what we do in production

954
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:37,240
these are not my words these are what

955
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,830
they're talking about inside the sei

956
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,630
there are lots of agencies already

957
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:42,730
thinking about how can we do our

958
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:45,010
training almost as a simulation to

959
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:46,869
influence what we do in real production

960
00:36:46,869 --> 00:36:48,850
environments and therefore how can we

961
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:50,410
use production data to create better

962
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:54,930
training for our for our employees so

963
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:59,470
the takeaways I hope that you might get

964
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:02,980
from that is there's lots of different

965
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,960
ways to train as individuals how do you

966
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,890
get better as a team

967
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,380
right how do you learn new things versus

968
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:11,140
get better at things both individually

969
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:14,890
and like I said as a team and these last

970
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:16,840
couple of slides right how do you build

971
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,609
a training environment that's very very

972
00:37:18,609 --> 00:37:21,609
realistic and then how do you maximize

973
00:37:21,609 --> 00:37:24,910
that training to improve your daily

974
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:28,630
operations right hopefully I hope you

975
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:31,780
get something that might help you to

976
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,820
improve your current organization today

977
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:36,340
we got tons of tools out there on the on

978
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,410
the table that might help you build that

979
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:42,670
simulated environment and that's all I

980
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:45,250
have I'm Dustin I am a researcher up at

981
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:48,369
cert but I snuck in here I don't have a

982
00:37:48,369 --> 00:37:50,020
security background it's like I'm a

983
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:50,500
total

984
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:54,660
Fausta right I'm a software developer

985
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:57,460
but I have been in security for the last

986
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,830
two years and I'm studying philosophy at

987
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:02,530
CMU which is all about game theory

988
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,570
making decisions and complex systems

989
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:07,510
it's pretty cool program so that's my

990
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:08,830
story I'm sticking to it

991
