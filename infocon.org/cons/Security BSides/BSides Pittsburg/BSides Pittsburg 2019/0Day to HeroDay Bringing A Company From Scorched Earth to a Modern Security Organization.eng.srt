can't see the screen but uh we got a

30
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,940
pretty big screen today so today we're

31
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:27,799
gonna talk about ransomware destroyers

32
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:29,729
basically anything that could go wrong

33
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:31,680
with your environment to the point that

34
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,670
you're at basically a desolation so a

35
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:37,170
lot of the examples I give they might

36
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,240
sound exaggerated they might sound

37
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,180
fictitious they're not these are

38
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,220
real-world situations a lot of small

39
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,140
businesses a lot of schools a lot of

40
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,540
charities they have underfunded IT and

41
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,119
non-existent security so we really need

42
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,500
to think about what are we going to do

43
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,600
in case we do get hit by something that

44
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,070
just absolutely devastates our

45
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,490
environments so since I started giving

46
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,770
this talk there's been a couple news

47
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:07,080
stories anybody not Pat yeah okay couple

48
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,519
couple were you impacted or just know

49
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:13,139
about it okay okay so yeah it's pretty

50
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:14,489
bad one about ten billion dollars

51
00:02:14,489 --> 00:02:17,340
estimated right now mayors

52
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,530
on delays a couple of our FedEx got hit

53
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,769
it was a bad one

54
00:02:21,769 --> 00:02:24,510
anybody see this one on Twitter so

55
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,730
there's a small email hosting company

56
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,470
via female they're very transparent

57
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,440
about their instant response but

58
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,519
essentially they caught the attack

59
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:36,000
during the middle of the white basically

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,560
and he's just writing zeroes to all of

61
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,049
his backup servers they really haven't

62
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:41,610
recovered they lost all their customers

63
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,870
emails anybody working oh seven oh eight

64
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,599
right now you get your spreadsheets out

67
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,190
this week Florida Baltimore you guys

70
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:12,079
what's it at today eleven twelve yeah so

71
00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:14,400
here's another talk anybody that wants

72
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,040
to give a talk go submit it right now

73
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,569
ransomware occurrences with the cost of

74
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:20,160
Bitcoin so bitcoins back on the rise

75
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,389
you're gonna see ransomware coming up

76
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:24,420
again so these things actually happen so

77
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,850
although that this is definitely a

78
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,690
hypothetical never happened I swear

79
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:33,959
let's take a hypothetical so you're

80
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:36,329
sleeping but two o'clock in the morning

81
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:37,620
you get a text message from your boss

82
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,709
says hey a lot of people are complaining

83
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:42,569
stuffs down you take a look at the

84
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:44,810
network it's probably a firewall issue

85
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:48,590
you log on a server and you see this

86
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:52,160
maybe you see this one

87
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,450
how about that one anybody know what

88
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:57,510
that one is wanna cry

89
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:01,830
anybody know is a little important or

90
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,180
maybe you just see this in the case of

91
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,220
VF email where they were just writing

92
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,550
zeroes to your hard drives so what do we

93
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,790
do we got instant response plans right

94
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:14,340
well we know it's important we just

95
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,630
haven't got around to it yet we had

96
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,950
bigger problems we had to upgrade our

97
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,298
Microsoft Exchange servers first and

98
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:19,548
then we're gonna get to instant response

99
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:20,730
awesome

100
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,920
how about disaster recovery oh yeah we

101
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,080
have disaster recovery Jim runs it every

102
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,030
five years and it's great well where's

103
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:30,470
Jim I he retired four years ago

104
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:34,140
excellent anybody know how this stuff

105
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,220
was built do we have any system

106
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,710
documentation oh yeah yeah yeah remember

107
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:42,030
Jim all right that's fine

108
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:46,620
we can do this so we are at a point now

109
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,170
that we assume that our servers are

110
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:52,230
ransomware they're wiped maybe it was

111
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,300
just a huge corruption on your storage

112
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,630
for some reason your company yeah your

113
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,970
computer's just aren't working what do

114
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:03,840
we so step one is to breathe this is

115
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,220
gonna be awful I'm not gonna lie this is

116
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,169
gonna be one of the worst experiences in

117
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:09,330
all your life but afterwards you can

118
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,370
come talk of b-sides so they got free

119
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:15,570
beer and uh remember to think okay slow

120
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:17,250
smooth smooth fast that's from the US

121
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,980
Navy you don't have time to screw up in

122
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,590
these situations anybody know how long

123
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,060
their company can stay down before

124
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:29,940
you're declaring bankruptcy anybody all

125
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,700
right if you guys don't know use a

126
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:38,310
barometer of two weeks why two weeks I I

127
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:41,669
can't hear anything scream pay period

128
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:42,930
thank you it's really hard to keep

129
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,430
employees if you're not paying them it's

130
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,540
really hard to run a business without

131
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,850
employees at minimum two weeks you can

132
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,200
be down and you're gonna have problems

133
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,840
okay so you don't have time we can't

134
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,340
risk a reinfection after we start

135
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:57,260
recovering this all right step zero one

136
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,850
engage your legal counsel if you don't

137
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:02,580
have one go to outside counsel there are

138
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,380
very special things I'm not a lawyer I

139
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:04,980
can't get

140
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,800
but you can work under privilege if you

141
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,720
engage legal and they engage the

142
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,330
incident response procedures let's say

143
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,550
you don't do this and the case does go

144
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,060
to court

145
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,770
everything's discoverable that you found

146
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:20,010
if you go to legal first you get to work

147
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,330
under privilege and not much is

148
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,740
discoverable it might save you in the

149
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,700
future all right so now we got Incident

150
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,890
Response guys because we're underfunded

151
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,390
IT we don't have a security team we

152
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,580
don't have dedicated IR people so we

153
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,500
called out somebody mandiant whatever it

154
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,220
is our job is to get this company back

155
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,060
up and running

156
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,980
so we gotta figure out how are we gonna

157
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,990
fix this so we got to say what do we

158
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:45,450
know how do we stop this from getting

159
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:48,660
worse and are we gonna accidentally make

160
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,170
it worse

161
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:51,830
that's a bad thing don't don't do that

162
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:55,710
so what do we know this is so I'm gonna

163
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:58,020
adventure 90% of infrastructure kind of

164
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,910
looks like this you got these old legacy

165
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:02,190
Windows boxes that just kind of exist

166
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,030
because you haven't figured out how to

167
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,470
migrate them yet they're kind of sitting

168
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:05,610
in the back corner they're running some

169
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,680
legacy stuff you have some stuff in the

170
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,300
cloud because cloud is cool so

171
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,890
everybody's going you got clients

172
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:13,470
running Windows maybe some Mac's but

173
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,240
haven't seen that a lot of places and

174
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,470
then in the corner you got this really

175
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:20,160
dusty black in blue or green it says IBM

176
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,650
on there so either a mainframe as400

177
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,030
it's just something that you can't

178
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:25,380
figure out how to move off of

179
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:29,330
economically so it's still there now

180
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:33,440
where we at so this is what we're saying

181
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,940
every single Windows system is impacted

182
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,310
by whatever we just got hit by we see

183
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,740
some c2 traffic leaving both our client

184
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,660
and server networks we see malicious

185
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,280
traffic being passing back and forth

186
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,200
internally clients so we see accounting

187
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,670
come in they power on their machines

188
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,320
about two minutes later all of them go

189
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,460
black payroll comes in same thing so

190
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,170
we're kind of in this mixed situation on

191
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:00,270
if you have a client right now you're

192
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,090
impacted but you're not affected so

193
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,290
maybe you have the dropper installed on

194
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:07,500
all your laptops and they got a timer on

195
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,990
there on next reboot in fact so we're in

196
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:13,050
this little mixed state IBM ERP yeah

197
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,840
it's chugging along it's doing okay

198
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,020
cloud

199
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,790
cloud yeah we're getting some alerts

200
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,140
from there but the server's themselves

201
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,840
look okay so I told you it's gonna be

202
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,860
interactive what are we doing who wants

203
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,400
to go first

204
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,180
not everybody wants I'll start off

205
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,640
update resumes okay that's gonna be the

206
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,159
first one okay well as we want to do

207
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:40,679
give me a hand cuz I can't see anybody

208
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,539
anybody anybody there's no wrong answers

209
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:44,420
yes sir

210
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,790
Roxy - excellent

211
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,790
what happens if let's say the virus is

212
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:53,370
installed talking out see - it's got a

213
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:55,560
kill switch in there you lose connection

214
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,500
- see - it just wipes something we gotta

215
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,360
think about but maybe we stop them in

216
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:00,890
his tracks

217
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:05,160
anybody else oh we're going bankrupt

218
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:10,710
quick okay identify okay so maybe this

219
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,300
is a commodity hardware off-the-shelf

220
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,980
that encryption keys are already up

221
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,920
there maybe maybe not

222
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,890
anyway else anybody want to do anything

223
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:25,440
on the network all right I'll let you

224
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,010
get cheap so we can power it on the

225
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,600
system's right if we power down the

226
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,020
systems maybe we lose forensics maybe we

227
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,360
stop it what if we disconnect the

228
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:36,810
Internet

229
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,510
we're bring the business huh maybe we

230
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:42,980
stop see to though maybe stop spreading

231
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,810
how did they get in we're not sure

232
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,880
exactly yet do they have one of our user

233
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,710
accounts at spreading maybe we disabled

234
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:52,620
users sure we power down the IBM stuff

235
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,420
it looks good

236
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:58,200
power down the cloud so once we have a

237
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,200
kind of idea of what we can do we need

238
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,760
to figure out what impact that's gonna

239
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,100
have right is there a kill switch we're

240
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,720
gonna probably bring down the business

241
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,460
if we're bringing down Internet

242
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,500
connectivity network connectivity all

243
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,050
right if we disable all users well we

244
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:15,420
got nobody working so we got to weigh

245
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,590
these and weigh these pretty quickly

246
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,990
because again this is probably an hour

247
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,360
one hour to of response we need to

248
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,260
figure out what exactly what we're gonna

249
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,710
do so most of the cases that I work this

250
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,030
is what we do

251
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,530
we're disabled routing between the

252
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:31,170
environments we disabled domain the

253
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,210
domain accounts not just domain admin

254
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:36,240
but actual domain accounts now that we

255
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,500
disabled their accounts we send people

256
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,170
home so something interesting is gonna

257
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,040
happen in your office too

258
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,900
you're gonna find out that the rumor

259
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:50,130
mill has a mind of its own it's going to

260
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,840
get out that you had an incident if

261
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,370
you're sending people home and all your

262
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:55,860
systems are dying you are not gonna

263
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,970
believe the stories that you're gonna

264
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:59,820
hear oh well the guy that was working on

265
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,080
a printer he kind of looked the Russian

266
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,900
do you think he was a hacker no you guys

267
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,430
got popped 200 days ago and you just

268
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:08,370
didn't know it but um try to control the

269
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,710
rumor mill and then go get management to

270
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,030
go figure out how to keep this company

271
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:14,760
afloat without technology management

272
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,920
they're good at they're very good at

273
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,690
very little actually so they're very

274
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,040
good at figuring out how to make money

275
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,140
and managing risk it's about it though

276
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,050
keep them out of your IT shop so we got

277
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:27,380
this right here we go businesses don't

278
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:31,110
more questions what's broken how bad is

279
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:31,380
it

280
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,820
what do we need to fix and what do we do

281
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,089
first let's go answer them so what's

282
00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:39,360
broken be very careful on how you ask

283
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,830
this and who you ask this to because

284
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:44,130
this is what you're gonna get okay I

285
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,050
actually got video of one of the

286
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,490
breaches that I was on it looked like

287
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:50,280
that okay it's bad

288
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,260
so rephrase that went a little bit what

289
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,880
do we need to do to stay in business

290
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,770
alright this is actually a better

291
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,900
question people can run with this and go

292
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,640
figure it out okay

293
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,260
most of the companies out there this is

294
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,220
what your business cycle is gonna look

295
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,960
like you gotta be able to take orders

296
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,640
make products ship product pay bills and

297
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,620
receive money it's that simple

298
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,720
that's how businesses work it's a little

299
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,190
bit different if you're in technology

300
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:13,860
but it's all about the same figure out

301
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,020
what you need to do stay in business

302
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,850
okay now we know how we make money what

303
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:19,800
do we need to do that red teamers

304
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,100
anybody I guess I should ask red team

305
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,310
nobody blue team couple all right I

306
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,990
don't identify with colors because I do

307
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:30,690
absolutely everything in my job oh yeah

308
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:33,000
those are my people so how do we do

309
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,830
these things so you are now on a black

310
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,630
box pen test you are going to be

311
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,339
scanning the bejesus out of your network

312
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:40,360
you're going to be looking for

313
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,190
Colette's you're going to be looking for

314
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:45,310
anything and there's a few ideas of what

315
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:47,110
you should be looking for anybody work

316
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:50,260
in a data center with a raised floor pop

317
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,510
the tiles off I found a dr binder

318
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,800
underneath the floor in one of these

319
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,930
shops and you are looking for anything

320
00:12:55,930 --> 00:13:00,490
and everything and at the time don't

321
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:03,250
dismiss anything as old or outdated it

322
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,959
might be on there you might got a pop-by

323
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,089
observer that nobody even knew is still

324
00:13:07,089 --> 00:13:09,430
existing draw this up on a whiteboard

325
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,440
okay this is what we're looking to get

326
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,130
to problem is this is what's gonna look

327
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,720
like to you this is what its gonna look

328
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,339
like to other people okay so again our

329
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:23,620
Blue team handbook Microsoft Excel but

330
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:26,140
everything in Excel things get done okay

331
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,490
so we're gonna create this matrix we're

332
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:28,870
gonna say what's our critical function

333
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,490
that we're supporting what systems are

334
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,740
supporting it and what state is this

335
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,899
system in right so we're just kind of

336
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:37,450
walking through a basic system recovery

337
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,339
procedure at this point all right have

338
00:13:39,339 --> 00:13:41,680
we scanned it is it affected do we need

339
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,450
to restore it do we need data on there

340
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:45,940
have we tested it so we're gonna move

341
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,980
forward on this make sure you're using

342
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,959
colors management loves colors they

343
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:51,430
don't understand exactly what that is

344
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,199
but they know green is good red is bad I

345
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,750
put this up on a big projector like this

346
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,060
find a TV we lit out of the war room

347
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,920
make sure that people can see it without

348
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,019
talking to you because the last thing

349
00:14:02,019 --> 00:14:03,550
that you want is them coming to you

350
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,320
every 20 minutes for a status update and

351
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,060
it takes you 10 minutes to draft a

352
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,680
status update and you only get 10

353
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,760
minutes to work out of that half hour

354
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,399
then don't do that make sure that your

355
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,959
noses to the grindstone because you got

356
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:18,220
a business to say okay now so how do we

357
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,500
restore this business well we got a

358
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,329
backup system we're gonna put in this

359
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:24,820
quarantine zone because we can't risk a

360
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,740
reinfection we're not exactly sure when

361
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,510
we got popped we're not exactly sure

362
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:31,000
what even hit us so at this point we

363
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,579
need to restore and see if the restore

364
00:14:33,579 --> 00:14:36,070
is infected this quarantine zone is

365
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,959
gonna be crucial and then you notice up

366
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:39,070
there I got new network we're not

367
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:41,740
restored into old network and this

368
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,630
morning Verizon data breach anybody

369
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:47,860
there couple you go so one of the first

370
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,510
cases they talked about was a ransomware

371
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:52,270
where they got a domain admin account

372
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,740
and launched ransomware so they

373
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,300
up the right square that's good they

374
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,980
still have domain admin over your

375
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,550
network great like next week you're

376
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,630
gonna do the same thing you're gonna get

377
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:04,660
really good at this if they got a domain

378
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,340
admin how are you cleaning up that

379
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,860
domain admin how do you alright so I'm

380
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,240
gonna make another generalization if you

381
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,770
got popped by this they got domain admin

382
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:14,350
they went rampant on your system how

383
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,850
many wanna bet that they have Cisco

384
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:18,340
Cisco on their network switches or admin

385
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,080
Paulo on their palettes and firewalls

386
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,560
right you're not sure exactly what you

387
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,130
still control chances are nothing it's

388
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:29,380
it's gonna be bad so we need to build

389
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,120
out a new network with new

390
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,520
authentication servers depending how bad

391
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,050
it is maybe new switches are they

392
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,940
rewriting your firmware you're not sure

393
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,550
at this point so we got to gauge quickly

394
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,890
exactly how big of a rebuild effort this

395
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:47,410
is but we got one problem up here yeah

396
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:49,810
you were running old Windows as your

397
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:53,650
backup system - he's also gone maybe

398
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,120
you're part of a wiper where they hit

399
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,880
the backup systems first so what are we

400
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:02,890
doing update resume right yeah come on

401
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:05,410
we got offline tapes don't we

402
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:07,990
who here has some type of offline backup

403
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:09,850
that is saving them from ransomware

404
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:10,420
right now

405
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:13,420
I should see every hand if not I hope

406
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,010
you have a good Bitcoin wallet huh

407
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:17,740
because what's going on more and more is

408
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:20,170
they understand that most people are

409
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,550
just recovering from ransomware attacks

410
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:24,010
and it's no big deal so they're

411
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:25,800
targeting the backup systems first if

412
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,170
you don't have offline that is protected

413
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:31,480
from an actual right you might be up a

414
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,850
creek make sure you have some type of

415
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,500
offline I don't care if it's direct ask

416
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,920
no I direct disk tape nothing don't care

417
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,840
make sure that it's protected okay

418
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,100
so we're gonna build a new backup system

419
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,840
we're gonna rebuild all of our tapes and

420
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,610
then we're gonna start restoring into

421
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:49,150
the quarantine quarantine quarantine

422
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:51,460
system out-of-band air-gapped and that

423
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,260
is not in quotes an air-gap that is

424
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,610
physically air-gapped it is in a

425
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:56,620
different rack with no communication to

426
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,330
the outside world you have a monitor

427
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,550
physically plugged in there's no RTP you

428
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,770
cannot risk a reinfection i'll say that

429
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:04,839
over and over again because right now

430
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:07,619
we're probably 24 36 hour

431
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:09,569
into the incident and we still have

432
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:11,490
nothing right we're just starting to

433
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:14,760
restore system by system monitor for iOS

434
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,709
iOS sees indicators attack indicators

435
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:19,230
compromise and verify that that date is

436
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:23,339
clean then we go to new network all

437
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:23,670
right

438
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:25,439
I usually I'm gonna start bringing candy

439
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,930
do these get you guys talking what do we

440
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:29,940
want to build a new network because

441
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,050
there's a funny thing that happens when

442
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,460
you get breached guess what happens to

443
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,460
the pocketbooks of the executives we can

444
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,110
go build whatever we want so what do we

445
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:41,730
want to build oh you guys are still

446
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:44,790
updating your resumes what do we want

447
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:49,170
what do we want yeah Network

448
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:51,600
segmentation excellent we can't spread

449
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,130
to all systems if all systems can't talk

450
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:57,420
to each other oh that's what guy oh this

451
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:04,050
pick on you I heard somebody know yeah

452
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:07,190
you guys on next

453
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,809
all the cool tools that we couldn't buy

454
00:18:10,809 --> 00:18:13,289
before what's your number one tool you

455
00:18:13,289 --> 00:18:16,590
can't go wrong

456
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,580
okay he's driving insecurity on you no

457
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:24,720
excellent what are we gonna use it for

458
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:28,090
monitoring traffic excellent something

459
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:29,919
right we probably don't have anything if

460
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,570
because if we had something we probably

461
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:33,129
would have noticed it we're monitoring

462
00:18:33,129 --> 00:18:35,320
traffic all right we're gonna rebuild

463
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,639
our Active Directory because that

464
00:18:36,639 --> 00:18:39,309
thing's gone oh so we got here we go

465
00:18:39,309 --> 00:18:43,169
chichi so we got network segmentation

466
00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:46,799
new Active Directory let's go get us in

467
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,509
go roll in ELQ if you want to roll in a

468
00:18:49,509 --> 00:18:53,019
security onion go boom I think spunk has

469
00:18:53,019 --> 00:18:55,330
a 500 gig trial license go throw

470
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:56,980
something in make sure that you have

471
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:59,080
something because here's another cool

472
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,669
thing that happens anybody here have

473
00:19:00,669 --> 00:19:04,299
kids what happens when you take kids

474
00:19:04,299 --> 00:19:05,440
toys away what's the only thing they

475
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,529
want back now all right we just took the

476
00:19:08,529 --> 00:19:11,019
attacker's toy away the attacker wants

477
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:13,960
back in so they're gonna come back this

478
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,360
time we're gonna be ready for them

479
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,769
multifactor you probably got popped

480
00:19:17,769 --> 00:19:19,539
because you had OWA exposed

481
00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:22,720
single-factor password spray for let's

482
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,580
hear what are we in summer 2019

483
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,399
they got 30 users and they tried each

484
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:29,740
one oh look VPN is also single factor

485
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,769
therein not difficult multi-factor that

486
00:19:32,769 --> 00:19:38,139
stuff patch managers chances are we got

487
00:19:38,139 --> 00:19:40,779
hit by either pick your favorite Oh 867

488
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:45,039
17 1007 o8 we didn't patch that's why we

489
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:48,249
got popped patch your stuff check your

490
00:19:48,249 --> 00:19:50,590
patches with vulnerability scanner got

491
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,509
necess you got Qualis you got free stuff

492
00:19:52,509 --> 00:19:55,960
open vas do something anybody here

493
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,840
running IR toolkits EDR with like full

494
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,809
shell access to your clients if you're

495
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:03,820
not check out grr it's made by Google

496
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,190
Google Rapid Response it's basically a

497
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:07,690
rootkit that you install but you can

498
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:10,509
take remote memory forensics so when you

499
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:12,220
do get hit again you can grab the

500
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,279
forensics from your remote sites even

501
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:16,509
really good stuff you can kill processes

502
00:20:16,509 --> 00:20:17,910
and stuff yes sir

503
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:26,580
Google rapid-response grr and throw up

504
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:30,480
HTTP proxy email protection you name it

505
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,390
right now here's the challenge that

506
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,370
we're gonna have we got a lot of work to

507
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:37,049
do now so and we're also running the

508
00:20:37,049 --> 00:20:39,720
Recovery's in the background when do we

509
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,860
know when to quit

510
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,530
so can you perform your critical

511
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:45,450
functions are you getting paid for the

512
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:46,710
product that you're shipping that your

513
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:49,110
customers are ordering right how much

514
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,059
longer can we keep the business down we

515
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:52,830
can put in a lot of stuff because we

516
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,179
don't have change control because we

517
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:55,020
don't have to worry about breaking

518
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,450
systems they're broken already right so

519
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:58,830
how much longer can we keep the business

520
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:01,230
down prioritize your work based on how

521
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:03,090
much time you have and then how much

522
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:04,370
more can you do without any sleep

523
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:07,440
guarantee you're not sleeping it's gonna

524
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,280
be my record is 168 hours I think you

525
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,809
start seeing stuff it's much better than

526
00:21:12,809 --> 00:21:14,940
beer like if you're a cheap date to stay

527
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,340
awake to find these ahead of time so you

528
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,020
don't have to think about this when

529
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,020
you're in the ninth hour

530
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,580
stupid tips of recovery three to one of

531
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,960
conferences everybody know that one

532
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,940
three hours of sleep two meals one

533
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,500
shower

534
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,840
yeah these can become negotiable your

535
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:35,490
war rooms gonna smell sorry war room get

536
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:37,409
a war room manager get somebody to take

537
00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:39,900
care of the team basically manage the

538
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,789
caught in the caffeine intake manage the

539
00:21:41,789 --> 00:21:44,100
food manage the schedules set up the

540
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:48,059
phones get the TV's working go buy USB

541
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:50,039
drives save everything you're not sure

542
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:51,450
what's gonna be discoverable if this

543
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:53,580
does hit the court systems it's part of

544
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:56,700
one about six years later they actually

545
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,950
were subpoenaed for some old email

546
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,360
records and they didn't have them

547
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,669
because they were gone but because they

548
00:22:02,669 --> 00:22:04,500
had an actual evidence and everything

549
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,900
they put that to the court case and it

550
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,480
was actually dismissed due to whatever

551
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,090
again not a lawyer but because they had

552
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:13,620
everything they could prove that they

553
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,000
actually didn't have it and they weren't

554
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
holding it back from the court well as

555
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,370
part secured out of Bank communications

556
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:21,929
the last thing you want to do is

557
00:22:21,929 --> 00:22:23,490
communicate new credentials over a

558
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:25,169
compromised email system don't do that

559
00:22:25,169 --> 00:22:28,020
if you have corporate phones and you

560
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,240
think those are breached don't you

561
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,920
them go by burners alright so moving on

562
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,500
second half of the talk yeah that was

563
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,830
awful I don't ever want to do that again

564
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:43,830
so how do we do that well again I like

565
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,420
asking questions so where are we worried

566
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,730
weak and how do we prioritize to work

567
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:50,610
so it's this peas in the room anybody

568
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:54,870
got a few hay gap analysis so we're

569
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,640
gonna look at where we are well we know

570
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,340
where we are we're we're pretty bad we

571
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,270
know where we want to be want to be

572
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:02,340
pretty good how do we get there that's

573
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,890
what we're gonna talk about so where do

574
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:05,580
we want to be

575
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:08,100
you can try to define a framework on

576
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,179
your own or you can just go steal

577
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,520
somebody's hey come on we're all hackers

578
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,900
here for all pirates just go steal

579
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,280
somebody else's work they do a lot

580
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,220
better anyways okay good so I stole

581
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,770
mists and I made it really pretty for

582
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:21,059
management so here's one of the eye

583
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:22,800
charts feel free to steal it

584
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,179
I've got the link at the bottom but

585
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:28,380
basically I broke down NIST 853 into

586
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,240
these very easy to understand control

587
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,450
cards and organized them by you know

588
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:37,080
your response phases and then I threw

589
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,030
down a little 1 through 5 tracker on it

590
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,740
to make sure that we are where we want

591
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:43,320
to be so here's the zoomed up one I saw

592
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,280
a couple cameras feel free

593
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:57,750
I really hope you're not recording me

594
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,190
alright so here's the zoomed up version

595
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,350
on one of them so you can look at

596
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:04,720
anybody reading this - 853 it's

597
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,850
wonderful if you can't sleep yes you

598
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:09,610
know my pain it is awful so there's a

599
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:11,530
whole section on physical asset

600
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:13,390
inventories annoy things you have to do

601
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:14,950
or you can just say physical devices are

602
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:17,160
inventoried and rank it one through five

603
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,560
okay so we decided on this one we know

604
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,120
we don't have any inventory system so

605
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,860
we're a zero we want to be a three

606
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:26,560
though so let's talk about what a three

607
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:30,460
actually means so capability maturity

608
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,680
model against ESPYs systems they teach

609
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,120
this all in the management the boring

610
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:37,300
stuff so we talk about one through five

611
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:40,450
one is a very ad hoc process this is a

612
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:42,790
single person defining what the answers

613
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:45,010
gonna be okay so this is really typical

614
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:47,080
in small shops where you are making all

615
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:50,050
the decisions step two is you kind of

616
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:51,760
know how you're gonna make the decision

617
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,220
you have a kind of framework but nobody

618
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,080
else does so it's still dependent on you

619
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,240
number three is an actual defined

620
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,400
process you can take a playbook or you

621
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,630
can take a process and hand it to

622
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:03,100
somebody and they're gonna get the same

623
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,960
results that you did if you both follow

624
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,630
the same process number four is managed

625
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:09,760
so this is a process where we have

626
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,010
exception reporting and alerting and

627
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,780
we're finding out where the process

628
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:16,150
screws up and then to get to five is we

629
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:18,190
take that feedback and we feed it back

630
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:20,340
in to product development or whatever

631
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,540
portfolio we're working on and we

632
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:25,840
continually improve this process okay I

633
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,340
had it on the last slide I think but uh

634
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,620
not everything should be a five if you

635
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,820
have everything as a five you're

636
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,470
probably miss managing your budget and

637
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,180
your money because every dollar we spend

638
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,550
on security is not being spent on making

639
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:38,410
money for the business so like it or not

640
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:40,870
we still are a cost center we can try to

641
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:42,850
change those words around as much as we

642
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:44,320
want to get whatever budget we need but

643
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,670
at the end of the day we don't make the

644
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,020
company money unless we're a security

645
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:50,890
company okay so we're at zero we want to

646
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,330
get to a three how do we do that well we

647
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:53,620
throw in an asset management program

648
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,930
right we set up some pretty lofty goals

649
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:58,420
on what we want to do you know we if we

650
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,530
have an asset we want to know where it

651
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:01,990
is at all times simple as that so

652
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:05,950
we throw down some basic objectives and

653
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:08,289
we do this for every control what

654
00:26:08,289 --> 00:26:09,789
happens is you end up with this

655
00:26:09,789 --> 00:26:12,700
portfolio you'll notice that like five

656
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,100
or six cards full in two asset

657
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,230
management you'll notice a thirteen

658
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:19,570
might fold into boner ability management

659
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:21,760
and there's more these are dis examples

660
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,529
but there's more groups out there and

661
00:26:23,529 --> 00:26:25,929
we're just going to see is you got a lot

662
00:26:25,929 --> 00:26:28,059
of work to do but if you get all this

663
00:26:28,059 --> 00:26:29,770
done you have a pretty good security

664
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:32,399
organization at this point so again

665
00:26:32,399 --> 00:26:34,750
we're coming off a week three probably

666
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:38,409
of recovery what do we do first now this

667
00:26:38,409 --> 00:26:39,789
is where we're threat modeling alright

668
00:26:39,789 --> 00:26:42,460
this is how we prioritize our work so

669
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,870
we're gonna there's a couple different

670
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:46,360
models you got data definitions you got

671
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,500
data flows you got any of your

672
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,090
relationships we can make it more

673
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:50,440
complicated and may talk about the

674
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,909
geopolitical relationships the Middle

675
00:26:51,909 --> 00:26:57,370
East right we just got hit with a basic

676
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:58,809
ransomware we don't need to worry about

677
00:26:58,809 --> 00:27:00,850
that this is what we need to worry about

678
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:05,230
okay we have things we have things that

679
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,520
are protecting them and then we have bad

680
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,630
guys yep

681
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:10,539
so let's break that down it's kind of a

682
00:27:10,539 --> 00:27:13,330
risk-based approach so got this idea of

683
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:17,500
loss expectancy so on the X we got

684
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,779
likelihood of something occurring on the

685
00:27:19,779 --> 00:27:21,779
why we have the impact of the occurrence

686
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:25,090
so anything on the top right it's gonna

687
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:26,770
be a big deal we're gonna lose a lot of

688
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,929
money all the time that's bad we need to

689
00:27:28,929 --> 00:27:31,419
fix that bottom left we're gonna lose a

690
00:27:31,419 --> 00:27:34,120
little bit of money never don't care

691
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:37,419
don't worry about it the other quadrants

692
00:27:37,419 --> 00:27:39,880
are a little bit more difficult so let's

693
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:43,539
say we're in st. Louis and we're threat

694
00:27:43,539 --> 00:27:45,880
model in an earthquake yeah if it

695
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,070
happens it's gonna be really bad likely

696
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:50,169
how did about happening probably pretty

697
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:51,880
low and we're gonna bigger problems if

698
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,390
that hits right but I don't like I name

699
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:57,100
a lot of time on those and figuring out

700
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,740
exactly how to justify it so I have at

701
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,270
one model that takes us one step further

702
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:04,270
I call bang for buck so we take that

703
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,919
loss expectancy that we just calculated

704
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,190
by taking impact times likelihood

705
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:10,779
throwing that on the Y and then the ease

706
00:28:10,779 --> 00:28:13,990
of implementation on the X so on the

707
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:15,610
Left we have very difficult project

708
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:18,220
on the right we have piece of cakes now

709
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:21,790
what we have is top writers a no-brainer

710
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:23,590
these are things the easy to do and

711
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:26,940
they're gonna mitigate a ton of risk

712
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:30,280
anybody here running laps local admin

713
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,970
password solution how hard is it dead

714
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,860
simple right PowerShell script GPO

715
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,750
you're done anybody that doesn't know

716
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:40,000
elapsed is Labs is a tool provided by

717
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,160
Microsoft for free what it does is it

718
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,320
rotates all your client local admin

719
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,650
passwords so if you don't have this

720
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:50,260
chances are you're running with company

721
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,270
password one two three exclamation or

722
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,559
something as your local admin shared

723
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:55,780
across all your clients so if I get on

724
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,730
one of your clients I dump hashes I now

725
00:28:57,730 --> 00:28:59,559
have the password for your local

726
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:01,570
administrator on every laptop and maybe

727
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:04,750
server laps rotates that automatically

728
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,460
for you it gives you a little GUI that

729
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,049
you can look up the password for the

730
00:29:08,049 --> 00:29:09,400
client at a given time you can press the

731
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,679
rotate button so if you do need it it's

732
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:13,780
there but it gets rotated you're

733
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,850
different you're unique it's dead simple

734
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:17,980
it's like a three-step process put it in

735
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,360
change control get it done next week

736
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,330
that's a no-brainer

737
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:24,850
big projects top left these are things

738
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:28,299
like zero trust micro segmentation these

739
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:30,210
are things that are going to be awesome

740
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:34,890
but they're going to be hard okay

741
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:37,299
bottom left again don't pursue don't

742
00:29:37,299 --> 00:29:39,370
care about those bottom right are kind

743
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:41,440
of things like when we have time they

744
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,790
really don't mitigate much but we know

745
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:45,160
they have to do it you know these are

746
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,870
like cross-site scripting on an internal

747
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,130
only

748
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,960
only visible to internal and it doesn't

749
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,580
really impact anybody yeah we know we

750
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,750
have to do it but when we have time

751
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:56,890
we'll clean it up so cool now we have

752
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:59,020
what we need to do we need we know what

753
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:02,380
we need to do first let's go do it so

754
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:05,110
we're going to obtain resources we need

755
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:07,020
people all right whether these are

756
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,100
six-month contractors whether they're

757
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,900
full times that's something for you to

758
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,880
decide right but we have a lot of work

759
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,559
to get done we have to figure out what's

760
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,179
the best way to get it done go get the

761
00:30:16,179 --> 00:30:19,330
budget for it go govern the progress so

762
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:21,760
we have an empty checkbook anybody know

763
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,300
how long the blank checks last after a

764
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,760
breach it's about three to six months

765
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,410
then you have to start

766
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,180
moving yourself and justifying your

767
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,640
budget so go govern the progress right

768
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,830
show fancy charts these aren't hard to

769
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,150
make they look great for management

770
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:40,170
right so govern the projects

771
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:42,010
reprioritize based on business need

772
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:43,950
continue a gap doubt analysis and

773
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:46,950
congratulations we're all CISOs

774
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:50,530
alright everybody on three ready yeah

775
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:53,110
whether you like it or not this is kind

776
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:56,020
of the work of a small security manager

777
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,790
see so kind of thing that you're going

778
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:59,230
to kind of have the responsibility of

779
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:01,240
now because you are the expert in the

780
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,610
company now where you take this from

781
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:05,920
here that's gonna depend highly on

782
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,480
business need in your relationship with

783
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,730
the Executive Board but essentially we

784
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:11,680
just took the company from absolute

785
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,210
ground zero things are literally on fire

786
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:16,240
- you know it's not bad and we have a

787
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,160
roadmap forward and we're starting to

788
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,430
get stuff done so at this time I'm tired

789
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:23,260
of talking I really like to make this a

790
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,420
discussion afterwards you know war

791
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:28,990
stories are fun email Twitter slide

792
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:33,490
shares thanks Sarah I'm willing to stay

793
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:34,810
here as long as you do because there's

794
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:41,170
nobody in here until - cool anybody for

795
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:42,730
the group otherwise I'm just gonna stay

796
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:45,180
up here yes sir

797
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:52,460
laughs for Windows Land anybody Linux

798
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,780
administrators here that has something

799
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,310
similar that rotates passwords on Linux

800
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:59,060
I do not write

801
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,280
I would custom write it because and my

802
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,879
codes gonna be ugly

803
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:11,960
yeah Labs is all GPO base active

804
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:16,090
directory you know shenanigans

805
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,760
come it was there's a lot of paid

806
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,210
projects out there Labs is free anybody

807
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:28,289
else for the group otherwise I'll stay

808
00:32:28,289 --> 00:32:28,789
up here

809
00:32:28,789 --> 00:32:31,620
so everybody's bored of me all right

810
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,799
thanks
