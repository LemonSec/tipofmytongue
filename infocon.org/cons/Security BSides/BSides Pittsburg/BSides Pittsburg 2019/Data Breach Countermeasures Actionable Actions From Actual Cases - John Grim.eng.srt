1
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:07,340
all right folks so we're about to begin

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,030
here our first talk today on this track

3
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:14,809
is going to be by John Grimm John is the

4
00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:17,509
primary author of the rise in insider

5
00:00:17,509 --> 00:00:20,630
threat report he has over 16 years of

6
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,849
experience investigating data breaches

7
00:00:22,849 --> 00:00:24,829
cyber security incidents within the

8
00:00:24,829 --> 00:00:28,009
government and civilian security sectors

9
00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:31,520
John is also also manages a highly

10
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,090
technical investigative response team

11
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:37,520
and they investigate data breaches and

12
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,520
advises on containment eradication and

13
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,330
remediation for customers will wide so

14
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:48,050
without further ado let John kind of get

15
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,940
set up here and we'll start the timer in

16
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:54,079
a moment thank you good morning

17
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,300
Pittsburgh and Friends of Pittsburgh can

18
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,890
you hear me in the back is everybody

19
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:01,070
good okay let me try speaking a little

20
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:06,290
bit louder can you hear me now okay so

21
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:09,500
it's my pleasure to present this year at

22
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,380
besides I was here last year had a lot

23
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,210
of fun presenting last year on a topic

24
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:16,400
and this year was fortunate enough to be

25
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,530
accepted once again to come back here

26
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,840
and speak to a wonderful Pittsburgh

27
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,450
black-and-gold audience so without

28
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,680
further ado let me go ahead and

29
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,540
introduce myself I come from a

30
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,420
background with the US Army doing cyber

31
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,880
counterintelligence and I was able to

32
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,070
move into the corporate world in 2009

33
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:37,070
and use those same skill sets to support

34
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,250
our customers our Verizon customers

35
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:42,430
external to us in terms of data breaches

36
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:45,860
most of the time I'm in react mode but

37
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,380
for instance today I'm actually in a

38
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,030
position where I'm in proact mode so

39
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:51,860
what I wanted to do is take this

40
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,920
opportunity today to share with you some

41
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,900
of the things that I've learned out in

42
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,790
the field some of the things our team

43
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,259
has collectively learned in the field

44
00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:02,960
and highlight five specific different

45
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,360
types of incidents that we've had give

46
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,030
you some direct countermeasures that you

47
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,580
can use for mitigation and prevention as

48
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,050
well as detection and response

49
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,760
so I'm actually on a team called the V

50
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,540
track team

51
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,400
it's the Verizon threat research

52
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,800
advisory Center formerly known as the

53
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,620
risk team we have a global presence we

54
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,410
have teams in amia teams in a pack and

55
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,360
here in teams here in this hemisphere in

56
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,230
North America we have the capability to

57
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:35,420
do forensic investigations everything

58
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:38,480
from file analysis memory forensics

59
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,150
endpoint forensics network forensics

60
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,410
full packet captures net flow analysis

61
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:47,480
recovering data from damaged devices

62
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,000
mobile device forensics and we also have

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,950
a cyber or threat intelligence element

64
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:52,970
that we can bring to bear with our

65
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:56,870
investigations as was indicated earlier

66
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:01,310
we I put together with a team of our

67
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:04,010
folks the insider threat report also a

68
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:06,019
data breach digest in years past but

69
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,700
more specifically today I wanted to hire

70
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,410
highlight the data breach investigations

71
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,750
report how many folks are familiar with

72
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,970
the DB IR in the audience okay good good

73
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:16,130
portion the audience usually years ago

74
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:18,230
when I would present the DB IR most

75
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,030
folks didn't know about the DB IR they

76
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,709
only heard Verizon and heard Verizon

77
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:25,100
Wireless or maybe FiOS but it's been

78
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,769
something that we've been briefing

79
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:30,530
putting together for the 12th year now

80
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:34,130
our actual data set goes back to 2004 so

81
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:38,209
within our data set there's been 86

82
00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:40,070
different countries covered this year

83
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,070
we've had 73 different contributors

84
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:46,100
we're looking at just under 42,000

85
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,560
incidents and just over 2000 data

86
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,420
breaches so when I use the term incident

87
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:50,840
please

88
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,450
that is anything including denial of

89
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,610
service attacks ransomware outbreaks and

90
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,040
as well as data breaches when I use the

91
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,769
term data breach just as a little note

92
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:03,799
here that is anything where a successful

93
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:05,780
threat actor has actually exfiltrated

94
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,430
data or compromised data from an

95
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:11,150
environment so one of the things here

96
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,220
and setting up for these five different

97
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,079
incidents that we've seen in the past

98
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:17,120
that I'll cover here in a second here I

99
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,160
wanted to kind of show you what we're

100
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,390
dealing with when it comes to data

101
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:23,030
breaches in terms of timelines when it

102
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,970
comes to the threat actor in

103
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,670
initially reaching the environment and

104
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,320
exfil training data it's happening

105
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,210
pretty quickly we're talking minutes and

106
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,850
hours however when it comes to detecting

107
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:37,270
and containing the data breach detecting

108
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,040
in particular it may take months or even

109
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,050
years we've had cases where we found

110
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,550
that the threat actor has actually been

111
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,680
in the environment for several months

112
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:50,530
and even a few years okay one of the

113
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,410
things - I wanted to kind of show you is

114
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:56,050
when we look at the data set all 73

115
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,850
different contributors and those

116
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:00,100
contributors 66 of them are beyond

117
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,350
Verizon their law enforcement their cert

118
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,880
folks there are other similar

119
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,710
organizations to Verizon who do data

120
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:08,140
breach investigations when we look at

121
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,180
those data sets and we look back in time

122
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,300
especially starting in 2014 and we do

123
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,640
our analysis we've seen consistently

124
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,470
over the years nine different incident

125
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:20,560
patterns okay nine different patterns

126
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,450
when it comes to cybersecurity incidents

127
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,760
and the same nine patterns when it comes

128
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,420
to data breaches okay and you can see on

129
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,070
the slide up here on the left hand side

130
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,980
is those nine incident patterns on the

131
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,780
right hand side is those same nine

132
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,400
incident patterns when it comes to data

133
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,720
breaches so what's going on here well

134
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,600
what we're seeing in gets compared to

135
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,760
the previous DBA are in the year prior

136
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,160
to this that insider and privilege

137
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,140
misuse in terms of incidents has moved

138
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,850
up to the number one type of incident

139
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:54,419
pattern or we're seeing okay

140
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:57,340
we're also seeing web app attacks moving

141
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,669
up the stack when it comes to data

142
00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:02,169
breaches as you can see over on the

143
00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:05,230
right hand side privilege misuse or

144
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,850
insight and privilege misuse has moved

145
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:09,790
from fifth to third and we can see also

146
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:15,460
that point-of-sale environment has

147
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,320
dropped down to the bottom of the stack

148
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,680
and then finally we can also see that

149
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,370
crime wear has moved up to this up to

150
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:26,610
spaces on the stack

151
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,590
so what is this telling us well this is

152
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,689
telling us that the threat actors

153
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:32,909
especially with the PCI environment are

154
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:34,650
moving from the payment card skimmers

155
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,650
the point-of-sale terminals into

156
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,849
card-not-present environments into the

157
00:06:38,849 --> 00:06:41,159
cloud okay we're seeing insider and

158
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:43,080
privilege misuse becoming more and more

159
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,340
prevalent I'm going to show you a little

160
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,219
bit more in terms of insider statistics

161
00:06:47,219 --> 00:06:49,800
that we have we're seeing the threat

162
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,569
actors adjusting to where the data is

163
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:54,000
moving to we're seeing the threat actors

164
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,819
using different techniques to get to

165
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:58,439
what they're looking for and I'll talk

166
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:04,110
about motivations as well in a second so

167
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,490
in terms of the five patterns that I

168
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,800
wanted to cover today the first one is

169
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,949
going to be web app attacks the second

170
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:12,180
is going to be the insider and privilege

171
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,729
misuse the third is going to be cyber

172
00:07:14,729 --> 00:07:17,370
espionage the fourth is going to be

173
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,979
crime wear and the fifth is going to be

174
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:22,349
point-of-sale I felt those were the most

175
00:07:22,349 --> 00:07:23,669
interesting when it comes to data

176
00:07:23,669 --> 00:07:25,680
breaches the other categories that are

177
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,629
listed up there have to do with

178
00:07:27,629 --> 00:07:29,520
miscellaneous errors have to do with

179
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,580
lost assets and those really aren't as

180
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,469
interesting because typically there's

181
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:36,000
not really a malicious threat actor

182
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,190
that's involved so in terms of threat

183
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,659
actors when we first started looking at

184
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:44,759
datasets we looked at the threat actors

185
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:46,500
and their access to the environment and

186
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,409
as you can see going back in time this

187
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:51,750
actually goes back to 2011 it actually

188
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,580
goes further back in time and it's

189
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,409
pretty consistent you see the external

190
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:57,659
threat actor is essentially three out of

191
00:07:57,659 --> 00:08:00,240
four in terms of the threat actors about

192
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,389
75% of the time insider threat actors

193
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:05,039
are about twenty five percent of the

194
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,839
time or one out of four times and then

195
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:09,539
there's a small amount of partner actors

196
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:10,919
which are kind of combination between

197
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:13,949
external and insider threat actors as I

198
00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:14,909
mentioned a little bit ago

199
00:08:14,909 --> 00:08:16,889
the insider threat has actually ticked

200
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:18,719
up over the previous year and you can

201
00:08:18,719 --> 00:08:21,599
see actually that the insider threat is

202
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,490
34 percent of the threat actors that

203
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:25,919
we're looking at another way to look at

204
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,009
threat actors is their motivation okay

205
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,330
and as you can see on this chart

206
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:34,260
on the right-hand side for 2011 on

207
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,429
Financial is the number one threat

208
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:38,919
motivator and this is actually prior to

209
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:43,149
2011 we're just showing you 2011 on the

210
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:45,880
second motivation for threat actor and

211
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,089
by far a distant second is espionage

212
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:51,640
okay so for financial we're talking PCI

213
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,160
we're talking fraud anything where a

214
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,500
threat actor can directly make a profit

215
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,140
off of or make money off of or sell it

216
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,270
and make money on the dark web for

217
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:04,480
example for espionage this is something

218
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,890
where the threat actor is specifically

219
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:09,070
targeting a certain type of data maybe

220
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:11,500
it's just a single file maybe it's for

221
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,020
an advantage when it comes to the

222
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,700
corporate world they're stealing

223
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,080
somebody else's proprietary information

224
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,270
or maybe it's nation state or state

225
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:22,270
affiliated when it comes to stealing

226
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:27,100
secrets from computer systems and then

227
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,540
the third motivation up there is kind of

228
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,610
a catch-all it's other we also call it

229
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:34,510
fig it's fear ideology grudge as well as

230
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,910
fun so these are motivations for example

231
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,640
hacktivism it's really big back in 2012

232
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,709
you can see the little uptick there in

233
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:45,190
the in the green for 2012 it could also

234
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,070
be somebody who's an insider threat

235
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:49,120
they've got a grudge against their

236
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,410
employer and that's their motivation

237
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:52,630
maybe they're stealing data or they're

238
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:57,520
destroying data so the very first

239
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,589
incident type or data breach site that I

240
00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:01,720
want to talk about is crime where so

241
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,620
you're probably wondering why don't

242
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,540
you're calling this malware well with

243
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,820
those incident patterns that I showed

244
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,430
you previously the nine patterns if the

245
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,959
data breach falls into one of those

246
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,910
other patterns and it includes malware

247
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:15,070
that malware is associated with that

248
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:16,660
pattern so if it's a ram scraper

249
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:19,150
scraping pci data it's gonna be under

250
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:22,300
POS intrusion okay so crime wear is kind

251
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,910
of everything but malware that fits in

252
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:27,220
those other categories probably the best

253
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,730
example of crime where is ransomware

254
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,899
okay ransomware is malicious software

255
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:37,029
it's something that doesn't fit into the

256
00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:39,100
other patterns it's actually something

257
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,079
that can occur across all different

258
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:43,209
industries I'm going to show you some

259
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:45,400
slides specific to certain industries

260
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,640
with some of these

261
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,279
these incident patterns and I'm going to

262
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,200
talk about but just keep in mind

263
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,180
ransomware is indiscriminate it can it

264
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:57,079
can target any industry as you can see

265
00:10:57,079 --> 00:10:58,880
on the left hand side we've got

266
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,160
ransomware second only to command and

267
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,250
control crime where on the right hand

268
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,839
side when it comes to data breaches

269
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,970
Ranson ransomware is at the bottom and

270
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,620
that's because that is actually not

271
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,870
being accessible train somewhere it's

272
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,579
being encrypted in place or typically

273
00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:17,209
not being exfiltrated so when we look at

274
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:19,100
our data set we can see that ransomware

275
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,260
is 24 percent of the crime where the

276
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,779
malware it's number two as I mentioned

277
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:25,339
in the stack right there with the

278
00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:28,700
incidence if you've if you're familiar

279
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,589
with crypto money malware or crypto

280
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:33,079
jacking I do have some stats up here it

281
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:34,850
doesn't even make our top ten list it's

282
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,860
two percent of the actual malware that

283
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,720
we're seeing out there we do see

284
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,480
crippling jacking within our cases but

285
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,860
by far it's really not the most

286
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,930
prevalent type of malware or crime where

287
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:49,550
that we're seeing so this very first

288
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,500
situation is ransomware or crypto

289
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,600
malware and this is a typical situation

290
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,329
that we see with our cases you're

291
00:11:56,329 --> 00:11:57,440
probably wondering well what can

292
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,970
forensics do when it comes to

293
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:01,970
investigating ransomware in the old days

294
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,440
there was a possibility we could do

295
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,000
memory forensics and maybe find the key

296
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,480
to decrypt the malware modern crypto

297
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,699
malware ransomware that's not the case

298
00:12:10,699 --> 00:12:12,170
so the threat actors have taken

299
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:14,810
countermeasures or steps to prevent that

300
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:17,570
from happening we can come in and advise

301
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,880
the customer on what they can do to

302
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,310
react to ransomware a situation we can

303
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,110
forensically look at logs look at

304
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,690
systems and determine patient zero or

305
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:28,940
the initial infiltration vector this

306
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,310
particular situation involved key

307
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:34,339
business critical apps being offline it

308
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:36,170
was impacting the victim organizations

309
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:39,260
daily operations their network shares

310
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:42,199
with file extensions have been changed

311
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:44,480
and ransomware nodes were found so

312
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,550
typically organizations recognize a

313
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:49,339
ransomware attack either seeing the pop

314
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:51,740
up ransomware notes and notifying their

315
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:55,699
IT or IT security helpdesk or calling

316
00:12:55,699 --> 00:12:57,660
the ITN IT security helpdesk

317
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,190
that they cannot access the files

318
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:00,630
anymore they've got these weird

319
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,280
extensions and when they open up the

320
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,730
files it's all gobbledygook okay so both

321
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,170
of these things were happening for this

322
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:11,970
organization so in part of the incident

323
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:14,100
response the the organization had backup

324
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,570
so they were reviewing those backups for

325
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:18,380
availability and the time to restore

326
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,400
files were being restored from the

327
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,650
backups those files that hadn't been

328
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,240
included in the backups were being

329
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,240
collected from individual systems right

330
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,400
for you know those few days that were in

331
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,620
between backup and actual use of the

332
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,750
files and apps were being reinstalled

333
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,550
however the organization was still

334
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,200
missing a chunk of their files right

335
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,720
they were encrypted the ransomware had

336
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:44,040
already taken place so in doing an

337
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,290
investigation and coming in to assist

338
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:48,000
that the response efforts the network

339
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,160
shares the files within those shares

340
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,660
they were last modified by a certain

341
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,550
network admin account so that looked

342
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,050
like that possibly could have been

343
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,970
patient zero in terms of the user

344
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:03,570
account so immediately

345
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:06,660
admin rights for that network admin

346
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,130
account or actually the entire account

347
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:11,160
was was disabled logs were collected and

348
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,850
the laptop was fluent forensic we imaged

349
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:15,870
so it turns out and doing the

350
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,790
investigation that that actual user

351
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,740
account that Network admin account had

352
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,020
received an attachment with ransomware

353
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,840
and the ransomware exploited in this

354
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,560
particular case on patched application

355
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,470
vulnerability so the organization had

356
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,360
found patient zero the initial account

357
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,860
they were looking across their network

358
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,780
for any other indicators are compromised

359
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:40,620
in rolling the incident down to getting

360
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,380
back to business as usual they still

361
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,510
didn't have access to certain files so

362
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,280
they considered paying the ransom it was

363
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,100
actually pretty inexpensive to pay it

364
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,570
ultimately in the end they decided to do

365
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:53,160
without those files not pay the ransom

366
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,500
because there was no guarantee that the

367
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,480
actual key was actually going to be

368
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,930
provided and would be able to

369
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:02,360
decrypt those files so what were some of

370
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,800
the key takeaways here for counter

371
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,140
measures in terms of detection and

372
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,790
response when it comes to these crypto

373
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,560
malware situations you want to block

374
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,149
your access to any command and control

375
00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:13,670
servers that have been identified you

376
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,560
want to recall any known phishing emails

377
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,709
from mailboxes and that includes not

378
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,420
just looking in the inbox but looking to

379
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,550
see if any users had potentially filed

380
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:25,070
them in another folder or if maybe they

381
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:30,649
were scooped up by by you as as spam

382
00:15:30,649 --> 00:15:31,820
email so you want to completely

383
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,830
eradicate those from anybody potentially

384
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,480
clicking on them you want to deploy

385
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,670
global policy objects to block

386
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:41,300
executable files and disable macros and

387
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,459
you want to train and sensitize users to

388
00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:45,200
report phishing and suspicious system

389
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,970
activity when it comes to mitigation and

390
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:49,279
prevention you want to keep host-based

391
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,020
and enterprise antivirus solutions

392
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,000
updated and you want to patch your

393
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,350
operating system and your third-party

394
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:57,140
applications and then finally you want

395
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,240
to also deploy a fin situation in terms

396
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,580
of mitigation and prevention and test

397
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,709
and validate data backup processes to

398
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:05,930
make sure you can restore in a timely

399
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,970
manner and you've got as much coverage

400
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:09,950
as possible with those files from the

401
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:20,240
backups so the next it's kind of hard to

402
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,670
see the next incident pattern on the

403
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:25,940
cover is web application attacks so

404
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,459
these web application attacks are

405
00:16:28,459 --> 00:16:30,500
something that we see sometimes it's

406
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,120
involving hacktivism where somebody's

407
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,040
actually hacked a web site or maybe it's

408
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,589
somebody that's actually exploiting

409
00:16:36,589 --> 00:16:38,630
sequel using a sequel injection attack

410
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,730
or doing something that involves those

411
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,190
web applications so when we look at the

412
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:46,760
data set for the Dvir we can see that in

413
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,310
terms of hacking action and vectors and

414
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:52,579
varieties and breaches the compromise of

415
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:54,440
web-based email accounts using stolen

416
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,640
credentials that 98% is rising ok so web

417
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,860
app web based emails are considered a

418
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,600
web app attack here and you can see that

419
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,990
on the left-hand side and also in

420
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,609
combination the use of stolen

421
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:08,638
credentials

422
00:17:08,638 --> 00:17:11,289
so this is really prevalent in the

423
00:17:11,289 --> 00:17:13,029
finance and insurance industry

424
00:17:13,029 --> 00:17:15,490
not only is the now service and the use

425
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:17,648
of stolen credentials on bank banking

426
00:17:17,648 --> 00:17:20,138
applications very common but the

427
00:17:20,138 --> 00:17:21,638
compromise of those email accounts

428
00:17:21,638 --> 00:17:23,648
become evident when those once those

429
00:17:23,648 --> 00:17:26,698
attacks are filtered

430
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,010
so this particular situation is a webapp

431
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,870
attack with a careless worker so the

432
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:37,000
organization was looking to hire top

433
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,830
talent and they were looking to go

434
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,780
beyond just collecting resumes of folks

435
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,850
that were interested in the job so they

436
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:44,470
went ahead and came up with this great

437
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:47,350
idea to hack the host a hackathon event

438
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:50,170
okay to generate interest to get really

439
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,960
quality candidates applying the problem

440
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,520
was they came up with this at the last

441
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,620
minute they tacked they tasked our IT

442
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,920
team to come up with a web application

443
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,720
that folks could log into a portal that

444
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,180
they could upload their information fill

445
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,270
out additional information on the page

446
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:10,600
so this was an enormous success the

447
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,760
organization wasn't able to identify all

448
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,890
kinds of top candidates right and they

449
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:17,050
were all excited and ready to send out

450
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:20,500
notification messages to those folks to

451
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,000
pull them in for another round of

452
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,600
interviews unfortunately while this was

453
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,430
happening and they were reveling in

454
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:30,220
their success they noticed significant

455
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,340
traffic accessing their web app server

456
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,900
there were several antivirus alerts that

457
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,660
were being triggered so initially the

458
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,550
organization was thinking well did one

459
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,170
of these candidates so they hacking us

460
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:43,120
are they doing something with this web

461
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,730
app so the initial investigation had

462
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,290
determined that an attacker was

463
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:50,440
exploiting a remote code exploit web

464
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,750
server vulnerability and there was no

465
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,790
web app firewall that was installed as

466
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,680
well so in the rush to put this

467
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,380
hackathon together they didn't do proper

468
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,780
code review they didn't put proper

469
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,060
security protocols in place to make sure

470
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,130
it was secured and what ended up

471
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:08,260
happening is an outside entity a threat

472
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,900
actor came in leveraged web cells for

473
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,550
remote web shells for remote access

474
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:15,250
prior to the AV alerts and compromised

475
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,840
the data that was uploaded by these

476
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:20,320
candidates so it turns out that the

477
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,440
organization not only was set to notify

478
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,810
candidates that they were accepted or

479
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:27,550
potentially being accepted for the next

480
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,860
round of interviews but they were also

481
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,540
having to notify the same candidates

482
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,310
that their PII was compromised by this

483
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:36,550
attacker so this was a situation of a

484
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,430
careless worker somebody who didn't have

485
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:39,970
the time

486
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,680
and didn't spend the time to put

487
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,660
security protocols in place and it led

488
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:46,210
to a data breach so we often see this a

489
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:47,800
lot of times where there's an insider

490
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,170
threat somebody who's skirting IT

491
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:52,810
security or cutting corners and it leads

492
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,700
to an external entity coming in and

493
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,950
breaching the organization so some of

494
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:57,760
the detection and response

495
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,280
countermeasures assemble an incident

496
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,020
specific incident response team in this

497
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,910
particular case somebody who come in and

498
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:07,030
handle webapp attacks engage a digital

499
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,620
forensics firm to come in and do a

500
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,750
deeper dive analysis into the evidence

501
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,090
that's available collect and preserve

502
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:14,890
evidence and use evidence handling

503
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:16,840
procedures because you never know if it

504
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,330
may go to trial there may be prosecution

505
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:22,020
the threat actor may be identified

506
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,430
prepare public relations responses

507
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,470
especially with these types of events

508
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:29,290
where external entity PII may have been

509
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:31,210
compromised or even employees have been

510
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:33,850
compromised in terms of their PII you

511
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:34,990
want to make sure that you have the

512
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:36,490
proper response and you have that

513
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:40,000
prepared ahead of time just in case you

514
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,100
have to use it if you already have

515
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,790
templates created it's just a matter of

516
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:47,880
taking those template templates and

517
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,840
modifying them to the particular

518
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,690
incident at hand in terms of mitigation

519
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:55,000
prevention follow secure software

520
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,220
development life cycle conduct your

521
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,440
wallet web app vulnerability scans and

522
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,920
pen tests establish a patch management

523
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,530
program and use enterprise and host

524
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:08,230
based antivirus solutions including in

525
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:10,060
special situations like this hackathon

526
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:13,060
event and finally install web app

527
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,400
firewalls file integrity monitoring and

528
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,260
intrusion detection solutions and lastly

529
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,850
segment your network in your data so

530
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:24,490
this was a particular situation that was

531
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,350
a great idea but there was a proper

532
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,670
planning put in place and there was a

533
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:29,620
proper security put in place to prevent

534
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:34,060
a disaster that occurred such as this so

535
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,440
the third type of incident that I want

536
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,730
to talk about is point-of-sale

537
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:37,540
intrusions

538
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,400
now point-of-sale intrusions are still

539
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,380
happening out there Chip and PIN is

540
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,760
still being implemented here in North

541
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,370
America it's been in Europe for a number

542
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:48,100
of years we do still see point-of-sale

543
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,110
intrusions of all involving the terminal

544
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:52,220
we do still see skimming

545
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,020
but what we're seeing more and more is

546
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,929
the threat actors are moving to where

547
00:21:56,929 --> 00:21:59,090
it's easier to get the data card not

548
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:01,039
present in the cloud ecommerce

549
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,679
environments okay but I wanted to kind

550
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,179
of show it highlight the point-of-sale

551
00:22:05,179 --> 00:22:06,529
intrusions because they still are

552
00:22:06,529 --> 00:22:08,750
something that we see quite common in

553
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:11,919
terms of our data breach investigations

554
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:14,809
so as you can imagine a combination and

555
00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:16,220
food services and then I'll talk about

556
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,500
retail are the two big industries where

557
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,779
this is a problem so a hundred percent

558
00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:22,429
of the point-of-sale breaches in this

559
00:22:22,429 --> 00:22:24,890
industry were discovered by external

560
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:28,490
methods so think about that the victim

561
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:30,289
organizations are not discovering it

562
00:22:30,289 --> 00:22:32,179
it's somebody else that's telling them

563
00:22:32,179 --> 00:22:34,700
that they've been breached and probably

564
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,039
the best example of that is fraud

565
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,630
detection or common point-of-purchase

566
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:41,330
analysis where there's fraud that's

567
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:43,640
pointing back to a certain merchant okay

568
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,590
and that's an indication that that

569
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,270
merchant has been compromised

570
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:50,899
so the payment card folks are contacting

571
00:22:50,899 --> 00:22:52,399
that customer and letting them know hey

572
00:22:52,399 --> 00:22:53,299
you need to have a forensic

573
00:22:53,299 --> 00:22:55,010
investigation you need to have somebody

574
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:58,549
who's qsa qualified to come in and do an

575
00:22:58,549 --> 00:23:00,529
investigation of your network okay so

576
00:23:00,529 --> 00:23:02,320
that's one of the ways that

577
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,299
organizations are being notified another

578
00:23:05,299 --> 00:23:07,309
is a customer who's notifying the

579
00:23:07,309 --> 00:23:09,200
organization that hey I didn't make

580
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,929
these charges on my credit card this

581
00:23:11,929 --> 00:23:13,520
wasn't me you know I think your

582
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,919
website's been compromised or it might

583
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,240
be law enforcement who's letting the

584
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,940
customer know that hey we've got an

585
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,700
investigation going on your IP addresses

586
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,929
or yours

587
00:23:23,929 --> 00:23:25,220
you know something pointing to your

588
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,470
organization is letting it's indicating

589
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:29,750
to us that they're part of a data breach

590
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:32,360
that we're investigating so you may want

591
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,529
to go ahead and have somebody come in

592
00:23:33,529 --> 00:23:40,429
and investigate so for retail as I

593
00:23:40,429 --> 00:23:42,470
mentioned point-of-sale compromised and

594
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:44,809
gas pump skimmers continues to decline

595
00:23:44,809 --> 00:23:47,390
it's because the EMV implementation here

596
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:49,820
in North America the number of payment

597
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:52,340
card web app compromises is close to

598
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,960
exceeding the number of physical

599
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,850
terminal compromises and payment card

600
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,830
related breaches so think about that on

601
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:00,620
the right hand side you can see how this

602
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:03,559
is this is becoming the case where card

603
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:04,070
not

604
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:07,309
is actually about to exceed

605
00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:18,830
point-of-sale card-present breaches so

606
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,450
this particular situation is the

607
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:23,080
point-of-sale intrusion the faux pas

608
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,429
this involved common point of purchase

609
00:24:25,429 --> 00:24:28,879
analysis fraud analysis acquiring Bank

610
00:24:28,879 --> 00:24:30,889
suspected a PCI breach of this

611
00:24:30,889 --> 00:24:33,590
particular victim organization millions

612
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,359
and millions of dollars of fraudulent

613
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:37,399
transactions that occurred worldwide

614
00:24:37,399 --> 00:24:40,999
okay so this is a big breach so evidence

615
00:24:40,999 --> 00:24:43,639
included transaction flow so when we

616
00:24:43,639 --> 00:24:44,989
come in and do the investigation or

617
00:24:44,989 --> 00:24:47,389
asking for whatever is available to give

618
00:24:47,389 --> 00:24:49,999
us insight in terms of the flow of the

619
00:24:49,999 --> 00:24:52,669
transactions if we can get ahold of the

620
00:24:52,669 --> 00:24:56,529
CPB analysis any third party access logs

621
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:59,059
point-of-sale system images business

622
00:24:59,059 --> 00:25:01,159
unit systems and third party servers

623
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:02,869
were also in scope for this particular

624
00:25:02,869 --> 00:25:05,539
investigation the problem with this

625
00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:07,129
situation was there was some counter

626
00:25:07,129 --> 00:25:09,320
forensics or anti forensics going on in

627
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,289
terms of self inflicted ones where the

628
00:25:12,289 --> 00:25:14,179
organization had already started to

629
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:17,359
react to the situation and forensic

630
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:19,549
artifacts were actually lost systems

631
00:25:19,549 --> 00:25:21,889
were rebooted if you if you do forensic

632
00:25:21,889 --> 00:25:23,179
investigations you know that you're

633
00:25:23,179 --> 00:25:24,580
going to lose a lot of volatile data

634
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:27,619
that may not be recoverable when the

635
00:25:27,619 --> 00:25:29,539
system starts up again you're going to

636
00:25:29,539 --> 00:25:31,489
lose other artifacts that could be key

637
00:25:31,489 --> 00:25:33,080
to the system so when we come in and we

638
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,519
do these investigations we want to make

639
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:36,049
sure we grab a memory dump at a live

640
00:25:36,049 --> 00:25:38,349
system image as soon as possible

641
00:25:38,349 --> 00:25:40,369
unfortunately a lot of the systems had

642
00:25:40,369 --> 00:25:43,759
been restarted they had also executed

643
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:45,950
antivirus scans which is great for

644
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:49,149
response but it also potentially changes

645
00:25:49,149 --> 00:25:51,470
data in terms of forensic investigation

646
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:54,499
and analysis in particular could be

647
00:25:54,499 --> 00:25:57,710
quarantine or deleting the malware it's

648
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:59,809
also going to be changing timestamps of

649
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:02,210
all the files that the a/v touches so in

650
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:03,979
doing the response effort you're

651
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:06,139
actually kind of stepping on the crime

652
00:26:06,139 --> 00:26:09,529
scene passwords were also changed and

653
00:26:09,529 --> 00:26:11,539
there were also accounts that were

654
00:26:11,539 --> 00:26:14,100
deleted and logs were also deleted

655
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,840
or they weren't stopped from rolling

656
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,850
over okay so there was a lot of evidence

657
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:20,390
that actually wasn't there anymore

658
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:22,740
however the investigation found that the

659
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:26,130
point-of-sale servers had unrestricted

660
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:28,620
Internet ingress okay so that's that's

661
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,320
not a good thing there was unknown

662
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,870
remote logins there was a backdoor rat

663
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:36,660
Ram scraping going on there was a

664
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,880
network sniffer and there were a hundred

665
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,980
thousand clear text transaction log

666
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,260
entries on a third party server so there

667
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,299
was plaintext payment card information

668
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:47,220
there was various different types of

669
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,630
malware

670
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:50,490
there were various different indications

671
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:52,530
that the threat actors had been all over

672
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:56,370
that environment so recovery included

673
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:58,350
rebuilding the systems restricting the

674
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:01,140
remote access with source address

675
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,270
filtering requiring multi-factor

676
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:05,250
authentication that wasn't in place for

677
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,590
the remote logins in reviewing the

678
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,419
third-party service provider service

679
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:12,600
controls okay so in terms of more

680
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,280
specific countermeasures when it came to

681
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,620
the detection and response this

682
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:19,710
organization didn't have a specific IR

683
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,840
playbook for the PCI environment so when

684
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,940
we do our assessments for instant

685
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:27,020
response capabilities more and more

686
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,000
common is not just to have an IR plan

687
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,830
but also have run books or PlayBook

688
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:33,750
specific to specific incidents that you

689
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,309
may have in your organization so this

690
00:27:35,309 --> 00:27:38,340
this particular organization didn't have

691
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,570
everything they needed at their

692
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:41,370
fingertips to be able to respond to a

693
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:45,929
PCI breach also for detection responses

694
00:27:45,929 --> 00:27:47,789
educate responders on effective and a

695
00:27:47,789 --> 00:27:50,940
timely response right make sure that to

696
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,409
the extent possible they're preserving

697
00:27:52,409 --> 00:27:54,809
data and not rebooting systems or

698
00:27:54,809 --> 00:27:58,350
overwriting logs conduct proactive

699
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:00,240
Network and endpoint threat based honey

700
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,850
or endpoint base threat hunting I should

701
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:05,190
say exercises to detect undetected

702
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,830
threats okay so instead of waiting for

703
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,510
someone to contact you and let you know

704
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:11,460
you've been breached go ahead and do

705
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,720
threat hunting activities in your

706
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,900
enterprise environment to see if the

707
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,490
defense is that you have in place miss

708
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:20,549
something okay we get called in quite

709
00:28:20,549 --> 00:28:22,380
often to do retail health checks where

710
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,660
we come in and we're looking for

711
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:27,950
or open text or clear text payment card

712
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:30,170
data we're looking for malware that

713
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:31,520
hasn't been detected we're looking for

714
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,320
other indications that a data breach is

715
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,480
ongoing it's just that nobody knows

716
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,700
about it

717
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:39,670
we review network and application logs

718
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:41,930
one of the things if you're a fan of the

719
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:44,660
DVI are over the years logs logs logs

720
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,940
will tell you a lot but you have to look

721
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,440
at your logs right

722
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,240
they shouldn't be just there for the

723
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,470
investigators they should be there for

724
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:53,300
the cyber security folks to look at at a

725
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,520
periodic basis as part of your

726
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,710
monitoring efforts define what

727
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:59,990
suspicious or anomalous and then look

728
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:01,880
for it don't just have the logs there

729
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,370
and nobody touch them and also make sure

730
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:05,900
you have logs because we do see

731
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,280
situations where there aren't enough

732
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,400
logs or the logs are rolling over the

733
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,840
breach has occurred a couple months

734
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,150
prior and we only have you know three

735
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:17,570
days worth of logs for mitigation and

736
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:20,000
prevention implement system hardening

737
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,460
baselines conduct vulnerability scans

738
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,890
quarterly and pen tests annually one of

739
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:26,330
the things that helps out in terms of

740
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:28,400
forensics is getting a forensic image of

741
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,260
the baseline the baseline builds for the

742
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,790
systems because then we can compare and

743
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:34,490
contrast it with any of the suspected or

744
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:37,280
the compromised systems to see what the

745
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:40,040
anomalies are what the the differences

746
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,360
are so we can narrow down so then

747
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,760
malware as soon as possible and

748
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,960
implement multi-factor authentication

749
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,420
for non console system access for that

750
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:50,180
remote access in particular use that

751
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:53,150
second factor of authentication and then

752
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:55,100
finally assess your third party don't

753
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,450
forget about the third party in their

754
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:58,430
access to your environment don't just

755
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:00,830
cover down on on your environment and

756
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:03,170
your folks but also make sure the third

757
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:05,060
party is properly secured and following

758
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,500
protocols to get that access the

759
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:10,550
environment okay this next one is cyber

760
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:13,130
espionage is just the fourth one so this

761
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:15,410
one's this topic is very interesting to

762
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:18,140
me it's very hard to detect cyber

763
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,910
espionage it's very hard to investigate

764
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:21,830
it because the threat actors have a

765
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,960
specific intent they're looking at

766
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,970
specific data and they're also looking

767
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:27,710
at not being detected or even

768
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:28,820
investigated so they're gonna be

769
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,530
covering their tracks and taking steps

770
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:32,990
to make sure that their tracks are as

771
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:35,390
few as possible so one of the industries

772
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:36,269
it's really big

773
00:30:36,269 --> 00:30:38,879
with cyber-espionage is manufacturing

774
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:40,469
there's a lot of financially motivated

775
00:30:40,469 --> 00:30:44,820
breaches with financing but espionage is

776
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,349
still big it's a strong motivator

777
00:30:46,349 --> 00:30:49,320
because that's where system designs are

778
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,320
that's where all of the secrets are as

779
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,570
the manufacturers are developing new

780
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:58,369
models or new devices for production

781
00:30:58,369 --> 00:31:00,809
most breaches involve phishing and

782
00:31:00,809 --> 00:31:03,509
stolen credentials in most breaches with

783
00:31:03,509 --> 00:31:05,759
a web app as a vector also featured a

784
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:09,899
mail server as an affected asset so you

785
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:12,359
can see here web applications and the

786
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:15,539
stolen credentials for manufacturing or

787
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:18,479
at the top of the list public

788
00:31:18,479 --> 00:31:20,159
administration is also big with cyber

789
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,499
espionage it's rampant in the public

790
00:31:22,499 --> 00:31:24,329
sector this is government ok

791
00:31:24,329 --> 00:31:26,549
state-affiliated threat actors are

792
00:31:26,549 --> 00:31:28,829
targeting government secrets classified

793
00:31:28,829 --> 00:31:31,559
information sensitive information and

794
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:33,959
that accounts for 75% of all breaches

795
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:37,019
involving external actors it's the cyber

796
00:31:37,019 --> 00:31:40,950
espionage there's been an uptick since

797
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:42,869
last year and you can see that 168

798
00:31:42,869 --> 00:31:48,839
percent so this particular situation is

799
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:52,799
the inside agent so we often see data

800
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,289
breaches involving an insider threat

801
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:57,570
where there's organization changes going

802
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:59,369
on and I have another situation to talk

803
00:31:59,369 --> 00:32:02,309
about for the next scenario the NEX

804
00:32:02,309 --> 00:32:04,289
incidents specific to the insider threat

805
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:06,359
this is also an insider threat but this

806
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:08,609
involves an external threat as well so

807
00:32:08,609 --> 00:32:10,320
this organization was announcing

808
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,119
unilateral pay cuts across the board

809
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:14,249
this included everybody including the

810
00:32:14,249 --> 00:32:16,889
janitorial staff so a threat actor that

811
00:32:16,889 --> 00:32:19,320
was monitoring the situation actually

812
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:23,249
came up with with with an idea to get

813
00:32:23,249 --> 00:32:24,989
into the environment it was using a

814
00:32:24,989 --> 00:32:26,609
physical means so they identified a

815
00:32:26,609 --> 00:32:28,649
janitor approached the janitor and said

816
00:32:28,649 --> 00:32:30,719
hey we'll offset your pay cut if you

817
00:32:30,719 --> 00:32:32,309
take this USB device and plug it into

818
00:32:32,309 --> 00:32:34,079
some systems and one night nobody will

819
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:36,629
know nobody's around and and will pay

820
00:32:36,629 --> 00:32:38,429
you for doing that so the janitor agreed

821
00:32:38,429 --> 00:32:41,070
so malware alert soon went off in the

822
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:43,769
environment indicating that some

823
00:32:43,769 --> 00:32:46,670
external entity was actually invite

824
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:49,110
touching these systems okay so the

825
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,520
organization was like what's going on

826
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,080
here they started looking through the

827
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,880
domain logs for indicators of compromise

828
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,610
and several systems were being accessed

829
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:58,560
by an administrator account so they were

830
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,210
befuddled they didn't understand how the

831
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:01,830
threat actors got into the environment

832
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:05,040
and it turns out as the investigation

833
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,360
progressed and as we looked at the

834
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,340
evidence sources we did some temporal

835
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,320
analysis comparison and we saw that as

836
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,780
antivirus alerts were going off right

837
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:15,020
before that USB devices were being it

838
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,520
introducing to each of the systems so

839
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,590
there was a correlation there with time

840
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:22,320
so this switched from not just a logical

841
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,480
breach but also a physical security

842
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,550
breach okay so by doing the time line

843
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:29,130
analysis the time frame was in the

844
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:30,180
middle of the night there was very few

845
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,340
people in the organization's building

846
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,350
and so there was a short list of folks

847
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:37,230
to interview so it turns out the the

848
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:39,960
janitor went ahead and confessed to what

849
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,330
what he had done he was promptly shown

850
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:44,520
to the door and his employment was

851
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,680
terminated so this was a situation

852
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,290
involving an insider threat introducing

853
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:51,750
a physical device in person to the

854
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:53,700
environment and an external threat

855
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,980
leveraging that access that that janitor

856
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,350
had and that financial situation the

857
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:00,720
janitor had to get logical access into

858
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,020
the environment in Kaza data breach so

859
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,280
what were some of the countermeasures so

860
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,070
in terms of mitigation prevention

861
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:11,129
establish a host base USB device access

862
00:34:11,129 --> 00:34:13,620
and antivirus policy so block those USB

863
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:16,168
ports or if you're going to have USB

864
00:34:16,168 --> 00:34:18,389
access limited number of devices that

865
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:21,000
are accepted to be plugged in and make

866
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,679
sure your antivirus are scanning USB

867
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:24,270
devices as well if you're going to have

868
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:27,360
that as part of your policy disable your

869
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,820
USB device autorun functionality so that

870
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,379
it's not Auto running when you plug it

871
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:33,899
into the system and limit your local

872
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:35,520
account admin usage now there's plenty

873
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,929
of other countermeasures that can put

874
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:38,730
input in place here including including

875
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:41,699
physical security controls monitoring

876
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:44,280
folks and all that but essentially the

877
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,320
biggest problem here was introducing the

878
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,929
USB device to the system by somebody who

879
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:51,179
doesn't even have logical access to the

880
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:54,530
system they only had physical access

881
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,790
now this I actually have two scenarios

882
00:34:57,790 --> 00:34:59,410
for this I couldn't decide which one to

883
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:01,480
include so I do have enough time to

884
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,580
cover both of them so this is insider

885
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,860
and privilege misuse both of these

886
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,990
scenarios were taken from an insider

887
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:10,240
threat report that we did earlier this

888
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,750
year and within that report we

889
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:15,040
highlighted five different types of

890
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,520
insider threats okay one type of insider

891
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,680
threat was disgruntled employees right

892
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,240
there causing damage or they're stealing

893
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,180
data okay another type of insider threat

894
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:27,100
was that kind of just covered with cyber

895
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,500
espionage somebody who's stealing data

896
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,170
on behalf an external entity all right

897
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:33,940
the third type that we've seen in our

898
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,890
cases and insider threats who are

899
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:37,000
stealing data for their own personal

900
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,130
gain maybe they're going to a new

901
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:40,570
company and they're taking customer

902
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:42,160
lists with them or a sensitive

903
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,510
information that they can use in their

904
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:46,210
new job the fourth type of insider

905
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:53,040
threat is threat actors who are actually

906
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,360
actually threat actors who are causing

907
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,800
damage to the organization because

908
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,770
they're upset okay those insider threats

909
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:02,290
are insiders who are detected rather

910
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:03,850
quickly because they're causing some

911
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:05,740
kind of damage to data or assets and

912
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:08,320
then the fifth is a supply chain where

913
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,310
it's either an external entity that has

914
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:13,870
accessed the environment or it's a piece

915
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:15,310
of hardware that's been introduced the

916
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:17,950
environment and causes problems so I'm

917
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:20,100
going to focus on two of those in

918
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,390
particular here wanted to point out for

919
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:24,340
the healthcare industry this is the only

920
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:26,770
industry that we see within our data set

921
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:28,810
compared to all the other ones where the

922
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:30,160
insider threat is a bigger threat than

923
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,780
the external threat it's actually

924
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:34,510
flip-flop with external threat and when

925
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:37,300
an internal actors involved 14 times

926
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,980
more likely to be a medical professional

927
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:41,440
okay it's no not admin folks it's a

928
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,090
nurse or a doctor okay

929
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:46,740
so either they've done something wrong

930
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:50,710
by accident okay and compromised the

931
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,690
system or they're actually doing

932
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:54,820
something they shouldn't probably a good

933
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,860
example is maybe they're looking at

934
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,450
somebody else's patient records

935
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:00,580
maybe it's an athlete and they're seeing

936
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,530
when that athlete is gonna be back on

937
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:04,190
the field and they don't have a need to

938
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:07,789
that information denial service attacks

939
00:37:07,789 --> 00:37:10,250
are infrequent but ransomware is big for

940
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,809
the health care industry I know we're

941
00:37:11,809 --> 00:37:13,339
talking insider threats but it's big and

942
00:37:13,339 --> 00:37:15,890
you've probably seen news accounts of

943
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:18,289
different healthcare organizations being

944
00:37:18,289 --> 00:37:20,030
attacked by ransomware in the last year

945
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:23,930
or so so this is the disgruntled

946
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:28,130
employee so this also the situation also

947
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:31,400
or was the circumstances involved an

948
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,380
organization change so a manager was

949
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:37,250
disgruntled wasn't sure of his new role

950
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,799
he knew was getting more responsibility

951
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:43,789
and not anymore pay so he went ahead and

952
00:37:43,789 --> 00:37:46,099
decided he was gonna leave so he used

953
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:48,349
his admin access to take over accounts

954
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:52,880
and download confidential files at about

955
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,859
the same time a programmer reported an

956
00:37:54,859 --> 00:37:56,299
application on a server having

957
00:37:56,299 --> 00:37:59,930
unexpected failures okay two separate

958
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:02,630
incidents happening at the same time the

959
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:05,539
Nexus was log entry examinations showed

960
00:38:05,539 --> 00:38:07,220
that the amount managers account was

961
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,869
logging into these servers before the

962
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:10,970
problem started so we have a connection

963
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:14,510
between those two incidents so the

964
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:17,270
manager admitted to accessing email

965
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:19,760
boxes and collecting data for use in his

966
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,910
new job he was interviewed okay we were

967
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:25,130
called in to do the investigation at

968
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:27,230
that point our forensics confirmed that

969
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:29,960
that had happened but as with any case

970
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,970
you never know what else is what's the

971
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:32,990
rest of the story

972
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:35,690
so further analysis into the situation

973
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:38,059
found that this is disgruntled employee

974
00:38:38,059 --> 00:38:40,520
not only was looking to take this data

975
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:43,250
that he had stolen but he was leaving a

976
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:44,690
nice little present behind for his

977
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:47,690
employer in the form of logic bombs that

978
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:49,520
were scheduled to go off at critical

979
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,799
times trying out the year including the

980
00:38:51,799 --> 00:38:54,020
tax season so after he was long gone he

981
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:57,049
was leaving a nice little present so

982
00:38:57,049 --> 00:38:58,460
look at this countermeasures for this

983
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,049
type of insider threat the disgruntled

984
00:39:00,049 --> 00:39:02,240
employee maintained a need to know

985
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,569
regarding restructuring moves only so

986
00:39:05,569 --> 00:39:08,059
you know make sure that the information

987
00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:10,260
it released is

988
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,790
appropriate for the people that are

989
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:15,420
receiving information and that way you

990
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,700
can keep rumors from floating and you

991
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:20,940
can keep keep folks from not being

992
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:23,010
disgruntled or paranoid in terms of

993
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:25,320
their job implement an action plan to

994
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,300
mitigate vindictive behavior by those

995
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,849
affected so what happens if you have an

996
00:39:29,849 --> 00:39:31,800
insider threat do you have a playbook or

997
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,170
an action plan that tells you what you

998
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:36,359
need to do next because with these types

999
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:38,520
of situations and a lot of times they

1000
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,140
don't involve malware it's going to

1001
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:42,390
involve other folks it's going to

1002
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:44,520
involve human resources likely it's

1003
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,859
going to likely involve a legal counsel

1004
00:39:46,859 --> 00:39:49,140
it may even involve some other

1005
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,460
stakeholders such as corporate

1006
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:53,070
communications so make sure that they

1007
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:54,540
understand what their roles are make

1008
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,190
sure everybody understands what each

1009
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:58,020
other's roles are and have that in a run

1010
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,150
book so if you have this insider threat

1011
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:03,320
type of situation you know how to react

1012
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,910
as part of the transition conduct a

1013
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:08,760
thorough asset inventory so as people

1014
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,589
are leaving the organization or moving

1015
00:40:10,589 --> 00:40:12,660
around inventory the assets that have

1016
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,339
been assigned to them make sure you

1017
00:40:14,339 --> 00:40:16,109
collect all the assets as they leave the

1018
00:40:16,109 --> 00:40:18,960
organization if they have access to

1019
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,910
critical information or critical assets

1020
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:23,880
hold those those put those on legal hold

1021
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,880
for a number of months or six months or

1022
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,150
whatever long your policy says have

1023
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:32,760
those on hand for investigation if an

1024
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,470
investigation is warranted after that

1025
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:37,349
employee leaves detection and response

1026
00:40:37,349 --> 00:40:39,359
work closely as I mentioned with human

1027
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:41,849
resources and legal throughout the

1028
00:40:41,849 --> 00:40:46,349
investigation so this other this bonus

1029
00:40:46,349 --> 00:40:48,119
insider thread this is the malicious

1030
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:51,150
insider this is somebody that is an

1031
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:52,680
employee that has that trust and

1032
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,550
privilege and access to assets and data

1033
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:58,290
in this particular situation the victim

1034
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:00,780
organization had an employee who was

1035
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,270
using their smartphone to take

1036
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:04,920
photographs and works in their workspace

1037
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,329
cubicle so basically they were bringing

1038
00:41:06,329 --> 00:41:08,670
up the computer screen taking pictures

1039
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:10,619
of the data that was on it and this

1040
00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:12,300
happened to be other customer financial

1041
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:16,980
data they were then uploading the data

1042
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:19,560
to the corporate cloud okay so the

1043
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,230
incident responders came in started

1044
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,060
looking

1045
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:25,730
calling the investigators we came in the

1046
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:28,100
cloud drive and a review of that found

1047
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,050
hundreds of customer banking credential

1048
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:32,690
photos up there and the time stamps

1049
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:35,150
actually went back weeks and it turns

1050
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:37,360
out as the investigation progressed in

1051
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,770
surrounding employees and cubicles were

1052
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:43,100
interviewed folks had heard the actual

1053
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,470
photographs being taken right but they

1054
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,180
didn't think anything of it and they

1055
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,770
were working in a sensitive portion of

1056
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:51,080
the organization but nobody reported it

1057
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,690
okay

1058
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:55,160
during the exit briefing the employee

1059
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,020
claimed that technically wasn't a breach

1060
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:59,270
the photos never left corporate systems

1061
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:02,330
they were up in the cloud so you would

1062
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:04,280
think that's all that can be done well

1063
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,230
it turns out looking outside of the

1064
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:07,790
enterprise environment looking at other

1065
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:10,190
intelligence evidence sources the clear

1066
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:14,390
web the dark web the deep web doing that

1067
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:16,430
research turned up a connection with

1068
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:19,330
this employee who had a boyfriend who

1069
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:22,580
had a criminal record okay and the

1070
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:24,500
criminal history involved financial

1071
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,510
fraud selling payment card skimmer data

1072
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:29,870
on the dark web okay so there was there

1073
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:32,240
a potential connection was this employee

1074
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,600
was she going to go ahead and transfer

1075
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,420
this information to her boyfriend for

1076
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:40,700
sale on the dark web in this particular

1077
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,640
situation the rest of the story was told

1078
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:46,730
outside of the enterprise environment so

1079
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,620
mitigation and Prevention so control and

1080
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,480
restricted access through the principal

1081
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,510
need to know trade secrets customer data

1082
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:54,500
and that sensitive proprietary

1083
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:57,740
information for those restricted areas

1084
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:01,610
restrict cameras and smartphones disable

1085
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:04,210
access to activity deemed inappropriate

1086
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:06,740
malicious or otherwise posing a risk to

1087
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:09,140
the organization and in terms of

1088
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:11,120
detection response increased monitoring

1089
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,830
and logging of sensitive restricted

1090
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:17,720
areas systems and data then finally

1091
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,760
monitor user behavior on systems to

1092
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,190
include external device usage in this

1093
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:25,530
particular case it was uploading photos

1094
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:30,660
a digital camera to the cloud one last

1095
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,070
thing I wanted to kind of impart with

1096
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:35,340
you from the DB IR is unbroken chains

1097
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:37,710
and path based attacks on the left hand

1098
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:39,900
side you can see the number of steps in

1099
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:43,770
terms of a number of steps per incident

1100
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:45,630
and on the right hand side is the number

1101
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:47,780
of steps in terms of the attack success

1102
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:50,340
so what this is telling us when we look

1103
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:53,220
at the data set is most successful

1104
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:55,860
attacks are short and it's likely

1105
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:57,960
because it's cheap for the threat actor

1106
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,300
it's easier for the threat to a threat

1107
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:02,730
actor and it's successful for the threat

1108
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:04,710
actor so by applying these

1109
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:06,110
countermeasures that I mentioned today

1110
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:09,150
you can go ahead and take steps to

1111
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:11,280
prevent these attacks from occurring or

1112
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,080
at the very least mitigate these attacks

1113
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:15,750
and force the threat actors to take more

1114
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:18,120
steps to get what they're after whether

1115
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:20,700
it be financial gain or whether it be

1116
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:24,120
espionage the longer their attack steps

1117
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,100
and their attack string is the more

1118
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:28,020
chances they're going to be detected and

1119
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:31,790
can be thwarted with their activities

1120
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:39,300
so some takeaways keep it clean clean up

1121
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:42,300
human error establish an asset security

1122
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:44,750
baseline around internet-facing assets

1123
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:47,550
keep data on a need-to-know basis so

1124
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:49,410
only the staff that needs access to the

1125
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:52,020
systems to do their job should have that

1126
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:54,600
access be wary of inside jobs track

1127
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,370
insider behavior by monitoring and

1128
00:44:56,370 --> 00:45:00,140
logging use two-factor authentication

1129
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:02,940
this limits damage can be done with loss

1130
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:05,190
or stolen credentials in fact use the

1131
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:07,980
third factor if you can patch promptly

1132
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:09,270
both your operating system your

1133
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:11,850
applications this can guard against many

1134
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:14,700
attacks includes ransomware maintain

1135
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:17,460
integrity use a fem system especially on

1136
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:19,890
payment sites encrypt your sensitive

1137
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:21,900
data be vigilant

1138
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,030
log files and change management systems

1139
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:26,310
can give early warning of a breach they

1140
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:27,600
shouldn't be a tool that's used for

1141
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,520
investigators later on have your

1142
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,010
responders and your sock folks looking

1143
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:34,140
at those logs and monitoring for what's

1144
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:35,910
considered an anomalous and suspicious

1145
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:39,030
and then stay socially aware I didn't

1146
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:40,530
mention this too much but a lot of these

1147
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:42,540
data breaches that we see are preceded

1148
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:44,430
by a social engineer attack whether it

1149
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:47,250
be fishing spear fishing credential

1150
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:51,060
harvesting web site drive-by downloads

1151
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:53,310
all of those kind of things are taking

1152
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:55,170
advantage of the human element and

1153
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:57,660
getting into the environment through

1154
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:59,910
that human error or folks not paying

1155
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:02,400
attention to emails that they receive

1156
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,760
and clicking on those hyperlinks finally

1157
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,310
remember it takes a team it's not just

1158
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:09,900
an IT security problem when it comes to

1159
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,180
data breaches over the years I've seen

1160
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:14,130
data breaches more and more complex in

1161
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:15,510
terms of the threat actors and what they

1162
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:17,760
