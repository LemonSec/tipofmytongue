1
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:07,050
all righty hello everybody thank you so

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,790
much for coming out today my name is

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,260
Ryan painter one of the organizers of

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,120
besides Pittsburgh and let me say on

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,020
behalf of the organizing committee

6
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:17,250
volunteers staff etc we are so so elated

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,210
to have you all coming out of the

8
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,669
conference this year so Rundle applause

9
00:00:20,669 --> 00:00:22,770
absolutely thank you thank you I will

10
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:24,509
try not to clamp into the mic or scream

11
00:00:24,509 --> 00:00:25,439
into the mic Wow

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,810
okay so I'm excited to introduce a

13
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,310
fellow Ryan is our first speaker for the

14
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,680
black track today so Ryan Volek will be

15
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,270
presenting open source adversary

16
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,489
simulation toolset review a little bit

17
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:38,250
about Ryan Ryan has rainbow-like has 16

18
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,570
years of experience in leading and

19
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,370
maturing cybersecurity programs for

20
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,350
large national enterprises with

21
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,000
executing major enhancements of to

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,769
security operations programs under his

23
00:00:46,769 --> 00:00:48,629
belt he's considerable experience with

24
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:50,160
improving defenses via maturity

25
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,289
assessments Incident Response and red

26
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:54,329
teaming as a Pittsburgh native Ryan

27
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:55,859
started his career in retail and in

28
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:57,660
higher education he's currently working

29
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,219
with one of the largest health insurance

30
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:01,829
providers and healthcare insurers and

31
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:03,809
providers in the United States among

32
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:05,550
many some of Ryan's passions include

33
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,409
blue teaming maturing processes and

34
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:09,630
developing people so that further ado

35
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,680
I'd like to introduce rainbow Locke

36
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,010
Thank You mr. Paynter all right welcome

37
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,350
your open source adversary simulation

38
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:23,570
tool sets all right start off Blue Note

39
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:34,289
first time with PowerPoint sorry what

40
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,490
come on come on

41
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:54,600
who knows what this picture is no goat

42
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,710
simulator that's right goat simulator

43
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:02,460
alright so why this is my theme goat

44
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,400
simulator why this is just stupid funny

45
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,000
and I like stupid funny things and the

46
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,320
it's interesting that the game could

47
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,750
actually simulate just about anything

48
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,560
you could simulate microwave all kind of

49
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,060
different things it's just very silly

50
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,550
plus my eight-year-old really likes it I

51
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,380
probably should have put in there that

52
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,470
goats kind of have to do have a like

53
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,110
similar similarity to like evil things I

54
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,130
guess so I don't yeah

55
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:32,790
that's my theme alright so agenda today

56
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,020
we're gonna go over the goals of the

57
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,450
presentation we're gonna talk we're

58
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,800
gonna get a hopefully i briefed

59
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,530
adversary and simulation primer we're

60
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,510
gonna go through for practical use cases

61
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:46,709
or use kit uses of these tool sets we're

62
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:49,110
gonna remove five not four but five open

63
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,230
source tools I added one and we also

64
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,330
discussed the future I know by like

65
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:55,680
goats email actually started out as a

66
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,290
joke from the software company internet

67
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,870
went viral with the video and it became

68
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:06,540
a big thing so who me Who am I in this

69
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,150
order I'm a Christian husband father and

70
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,950
the manager at hmmm health solutions

71
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,810
I've got a few experience got a few

72
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,760
creds and this is actually me and my

73
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,400
besides 2017 shirt and pieces just like

74
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,200
five days ago had a great great time

75
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,840
first time besides talk yeah so so goals

76
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,959
I want to help you understand the

77
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:29,700
practical benefits of adversary

78
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,950
simulation and the tool sets we're gonna

79
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,600
do a quick review of the five tool sets

80
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,480
kind of like a software review I want to

81
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,160
encourage you the community to

82
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,620
participate and to utilize and

83
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,910
participate in the development of these

84
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:45,360
tools I hopefully and I'm going to

85
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,070
entertain both technical and manager

86
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:51,780
levels defenders so why I really think

87
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,519
these are some important concepts for

88
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,100
cyber defense just based on my

89
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,230
experience there's a lot of new things

90
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,459
coming out like the miter attack

91
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:01,640
framework where we can better quantify

92
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,650
operationalize and and prioritize our

93
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,690
defenses through using the techniques in

94
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,330
the miter attack framework I think these

95
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:12,629
tool sets are in generally not widely

96
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:13,920
discussed in this in the security

97
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,510
community which is kind of why I want to

98
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:19,199
start talking about them I you know I

99
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,229
learned they what they really learned a

100
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:23,669
lot through this process and I wanted to

101
00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:26,699
share the practical uses and I really

102
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,830
want to give back to the community and

103
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,790
by the way I'm Noam

104
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:32,490
by no means an expert I'm really just a

105
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:34,470
InfoSec guy who just ran through these

106
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,210
tools just to learn a lot of things I'm

107
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:41,310
just sharing my experience so throughout

108
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,900
the talk you're gonna hear me say a few

109
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,600
different words though these words mean

110
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,490
the same thing so when I say adversary I

111
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,650
meant I mean threat group or a threat

112
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,440
actor or threat group I may say either

113
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,250
one

114
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,870
when I say simulation also means

115
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,570
emulation when I say test it also means

116
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,490
a miter technique or an attack so just

117
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,979
as you here listening to me talk that's

118
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:03,539
sometimes the terminology that you may

119
00:05:03,539 --> 00:05:09,030
hear so we're gonna Stoff a quick miter

120
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:11,130
primer I hopefully everybody in this

121
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:13,700
room knows this there's 244 techniques

122
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,930
classified under 12 technics that

123
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:19,200
classify the latter half of the cyber

124
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,030
attack kill chain we're gonna be

125
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:24,360
focusing on techniques today because

126
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,000
that's what these tool sets do many of

127
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,380
you are familiar with the pyramid of

128
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,570
pain for cyber defense or an art of

129
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:33,930
intelligence artifacts where as you go

130
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,090
up the cyber I'm sorry the pyramid of

131
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,860
pain it gets tougher and tougher as you

132
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,400
go up the the the pyramid I put at the

133
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,220
top adversaries they might be the

134
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,070
toughest part artifact I guess to

135
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:50,210
identify however the good news is our

136
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:54,120
controls and intelligence is getting

137
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,610
better at TTP mappings specifically to

138
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,620
the miter framework and we're also

139
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,560
getting better as an industry with that

140
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:06,510
identifying our adversaries so how do

141
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,130
you identify adversary I have a series

142
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,710
other there's lots of ways to do that a

143
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,719
lot of organizations three-letter

144
00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:14,340
organizations through other government

145
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,360
EDR tools I mess

146
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,819
P vendors they're all coming have a lot

147
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:19,770
of their databases of intelligence is

148
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:22,110
getting better there are 86 adversary

149
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,819
groups currently published and miters

150
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:30,150
website so this is an example of an

151
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,680
adversary and the information that's

152
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,969
available through the public miter

153
00:06:34,969 --> 00:06:37,050
reference this is deep and a lot of

154
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,240
people know about the Panda it gives you

155
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,830
some explanation of what the attack

156
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,960
group is and then the techniques

157
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,900
utilized and the software utilized all

158
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:51,599
public publicly available the defining

159
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,020
adversaries is is tough because it

160
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,939
utilizes concept called technique

161
00:06:56,939 --> 00:06:58,620
cheating which is what I want to kind of

162
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,960
focus on but also in addition to

163
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,659
technique chaining but then reviewing

164
00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:05,789
the mission of admission and objective

165
00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:07,919
of an adversary but we're gonna focus on

166
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,750
technique chaining because that's what

167
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,210
these these tool sets focus on and this

168
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:14,789
it this graphic hopefully kind of

169
00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:16,319
explains what technique chaining means

170
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,599
as throughout a cyber attack throughout

171
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:21,029
the kill chain of a cyber attack an

172
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:23,009
adversary will look like this we'll use

173
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:24,300
these behaviors or I'm sorry these

174
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,599
tactics to identify behaviors I'm sorry

175
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,650
these techniques to identify behaviors

176
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,990
so adversary simulation why is it so

177
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,599
important what is it so simulation is

178
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:39,150
emulating the technique chains of an

179
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:42,449
adversary that's most likely to target

180
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:44,339
your environment so we're not switching

181
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,169
the focus on just the TTP's and

182
00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:48,270
artifacts we're switching to looking at

183
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,490
all the TTP's combined and looking at

184
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:53,279
the behaviors that are observed in a

185
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,349
cyber attack

186
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,759
so why identify and stimulate these

187
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:58,740
adversaries well you've heard it said by

188
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,839
famous researchers that the blue team's

189
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:02,879
only need to detect once throughout the

190
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,060
cyber kill chain a defenders primary

191
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,319
goal should be to increase that

192
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:09,479
probability within that kill chain to

193
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:13,139
detect that attack identification to

194
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:14,580
identifying our adversaries allows us to

195
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,889
prioritize which techniques and cyber

196
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:22,379
controls we should focus on there's more

197
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:23,969
information a lot of great information

198
00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:26,399
available on the web it's a whole nother

199
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:28,199
talk in itself about the process of

200
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:28,980
adversaries thing

201
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,420
but I thought this was a good one to

202
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:33,090
reference this is just a this is a talk

203
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:35,789
on sands websites but attacking the

204
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:39,030
status quo threat based adversary

205
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,919
emulation with miter attack by Katie

206
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:43,020
Nichols and Cody Thomas it's a five

207
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,210
steps of adversary simulation the

208
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,220
process and we were focusing on that

209
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:51,570
last step here today so the tool sets

210
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,810
all these tool sets discussed today

211
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:56,160
Maps simulated attacks to the miter

212
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,760
techniques all these tool sets are

213
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,800
frameworks that include typically

214
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,160
include a sample of tests and the

215
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,110
community is encouraged to participate

216
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:10,980
in developing those tests all these tool

217
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,050
sets utilize typically utilize scripts

218
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,260
for executing commands on the hosts some

219
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:20,130
these tool sets include binaries or in

220
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:22,290
bi and executables that come with the

221
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:27,090
test some of the tests get binaries from

222
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,620
the internet to execute some of these

223
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,210
tests require dll's or separate

224
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:33,060
executables my point here I guess this

225
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,500
is some of these tests actually include

226
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,520
the binaries some of these tools include

227
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,870
the binary some dump all these tool sets

228
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,600
are typically safe and typically include

229
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:48,720
cleanup functionality all these tools

230
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,640
have the ability also to create

231
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,770
technique chains to simulate an

232
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:56,340
adversary or at least define a strategy

233
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,640
to help simulate a strategy or simulate

234
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,940
an adversary all these tools are either

235
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,180
locally executed or an agent

236
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,150
client-server relationship with an agent

237
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,560
that communicates with the server or

238
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,470
through a remote access tool it's

239
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,900
interesting that none of these or very

240
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,140
few of these actually include

241
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,880
adversaries to simulate so it's very

242
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,280
interesting on that they do give samples

243
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,910
a lot of them do give samples I still

244
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,290
probably wouldn't recommend it running

245
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:29,970
for it in production environments unless

246
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,500
you know that the tools really well and

247
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:36,390
what they do so let's go over for

248
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,580
practical uses of these simulation tool

249
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,840
sets

250
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,090
the first one is supporting purple team

251
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:46,210
testing so in my definition of purple

252
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,950
teaming and once summed up in one

253
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:48,460
sentence

254
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:52,090
the tester says hey I did this did you

255
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:54,100
see it in the defender responds yes or

256
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,090
no so primary so adversary simulation

257
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,690
tool sets are the primary tool set for

258
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:05,070
red teaming I'm sorry purple teaming

259
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:07,090
adversary simulations also known as

260
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:11,080
threat based red teaming that means when

261
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,020
a red team and engagement would like

262
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,540
pretend to be essentially an adversary

263
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,460
and utilize the techniques that the

264
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:21,820
adversaries utilize so pen testers I am

265
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,740
hearing to starting to consider use

266
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,440
utilizing these tool sets one to help

267
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,660
communicate their pen test reports and

268
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,120
the techniques that they utilized to

269
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,460
their clients

270
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,750
another use that there possibly

271
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:38,170
utilizing utilizing is assisting the

272
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,560
customer training the customers to

273
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,030
utilize these tool sets the validate and

274
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,940
test for mitigation and validation post

275
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:49,210
penetration test and some I've also

276
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,550
heard that some are using a pen these

277
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:54,940
tools as a penetration test tool in its

278
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,250
own due to some of the automation and

279
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,600
variance that these some of these tools

280
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,060
can provide we'll talk more about that

281
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,560
the second practical use for these tool

282
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,970
sets is to quick test your cyber

283
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:10,270
controls you really want to answer you

284
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,940
know hey did my fancy new EDR EPP or

285
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,860
MSSP that I just purchased did it

286
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,050
actually detect what it should be

287
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:19,090
detecting it is actually working is it

288
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,350
functional

289
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,240
a lot some of these tool sets have the

290
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,430
ability to just run all the tests and in

291
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:27,280
within the tool the tool set typically

292
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,530
that's fairly easy easy some tool sets

293
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:32,620
bet do better than others you serve

294
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,690
protect for this is very useful as I

295
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,400
mentioned useful for testing even new or

296
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,280
existing controls a lot of times this is

297
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,810
these tools are utilized through

298
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,820
technical proof of concepts for security

299
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:47,020
products and services a useful idea that

300
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,850
I thought is develop a simulated

301
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,860
detection report for your an SSP or an

302
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,860
EDR vendor

303
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,300
for roadmaps for detection your

304
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,650
organization you'll for your

305
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,470
organization techniques that your avatar

306
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:03,870
ease adversaries utilize another thing

307
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:06,000
that you could utilize is the for your

308
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,250
quick test is testing your sock for

309
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,820
simulating tests and how they respond

310
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:15,510
you know testing also post tests post

311
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,300
tests can also help with defining

312
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,710
training opportunities within your sock

313
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:22,230
identifying which logs and the alert

314
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,510
names and make sure they're intuitive to

315
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:27,330
your analysts we go also look for

316
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:29,430
improvements in your knowledge bases for

317
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:33,330
those simulated tests and also you could

318
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,250
also test the manual or automated

319
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:40,860
response triage with those events the

320
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,140
third use practical use is improving

321
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,030
your our cyber assessment and threat

322
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:48,630
hunting processes simulation improves

323
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:51,810
the detection maturity measurement and

324
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,190
that's the key is the maturity

325
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,800
measurement of a cyber assessment or a

326
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,840
threat hunt process or a certain threat

327
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,420
hunt if a control detects a simulated

328
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,810
test then the maturity is risen for that

329
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:06,560
for that specific tested technique

330
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,630
you've seen these are the heat maps and

331
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:17,640
maturity over time this is a threat

332
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,590
detecting I'm sorry a threat hunt

333
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,450
technique detection maturity level so

334
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:23,790
through each technique that is hunted or

335
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:28,080
tested you could with a properly

336
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,850
simulated attack and detected attack

337
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:32,510
should put you in a good or excellent

338
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:35,520
five four or five zero to five level

339
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,830
there are many different ways to

340
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:40,290
quantify your hunt here's some really

341
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:41,930
good resources that I recommend

342
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:44,190
quantifying your hunt and but not your

343
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,260
parents red teaming by Devin Kerr and

344
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,080
Roberto Rodriguez and then ready to hunt

345
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,610
first show me your data is by Robert

346
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,440
Rodriguez really good information about

347
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,420
how to quantify your threat hunts in

348
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:58,110
cyber assessments by the way I will be

349
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:00,750
providing these copy of the slides at

350
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,310
the end so you no need to take pictures

351
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,800
all right so the last and final

352
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,540
practical use case for these tool sets

353
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,839
is security product development it's a

354
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,509
key concept for a lot of security

355
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:16,600
software providers like EDR and EPP NMS

356
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,420
MSSP vendors you know they're utilized

357
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,430
in many of these tools utilized in their

358
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:23,230
QA processes for regression testing

359
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:27,209
validate their product actually works so

360
00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:30,399
typically like run like it's inserted

361
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,860
within a normal QA process for normal

362
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:36,160
software development ran after changes

363
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,019
or a new tech technique detection

364
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:40,629
functionalities added simulation tools

365
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:43,089
are utilized to help help improve noise

366
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:46,059
rates really improve relative accuracy

367
00:15:46,059 --> 00:15:48,009
and help with the output that the tools

368
00:15:48,009 --> 00:15:50,949
provide so a simulated test confirms

369
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:53,220
acceptance criteria it's good

370
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,959
some EDR and EBP developers that I've

371
00:15:55,959 --> 00:15:58,389
encountered actually have a one to one

372
00:15:58,389 --> 00:16:00,790
one to one test for each technique and

373
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,019
function within their development

374
00:16:02,019 --> 00:16:07,629
processes so those are the four

375
00:16:07,629 --> 00:16:09,850
practical uses I want to talk about

376
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:13,269
something there's an issue a process

377
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:14,769
issue throughout the simulation that's

378
00:16:14,769 --> 00:16:17,709
it's a challenge it's called I'm gonna

379
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:18,970
call it I'm sure I'm not calling it

380
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,379
actually Chris Gates called it closing

381
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:23,019
the alert loop so what the problem is

382
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:25,990
after you perform a test it takes a lot

383
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,600
of manual effort after the test is that

384
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,509
identified to law go into your logging

385
00:16:31,509 --> 00:16:33,399
system and validate yep did my tests

386
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:36,730
detect did it prevent yes or no that

387
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,800
process right now I have not found any

388
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,529
open source tool that does that is able

389
00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:44,559
to automate that process so really the

390
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:46,329
goal of the process to close the alert

391
00:16:46,329 --> 00:16:49,029
group alert loop would be to execute and

392
00:16:49,029 --> 00:16:51,670
generate that alert after a simulated

393
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,889
simulated test is not detected

394
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:56,110
hands-free so we want that process to be

395
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:56,790
hands-free

396
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:59,559
so really the desired process we really

397
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:02,170
like to help address this issue is for

398
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:04,030
every new technique or intelligence

399
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,980
contained or when a new test is

400
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,409
developed in the community execute that

401
00:17:08,409 --> 00:17:11,349
test that have our logging systems

402
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:13,000
detect and log that system or controls

403
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,819
it could be an EDR could be a sim but

404
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:16,660
then the sim

405
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,010
until would then integrate with that

406
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:20,800
logging source and I and identify

407
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,770
whether that test was I Det simulated

408
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:26,410
was identified detected or not if it's

409
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:28,270
not then it sends out an alert

410
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:31,480
hey a test was executed but not found in

411
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:37,480
your log so that is something that is as

412
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,310
that some of these tool sets needs some

413
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,330
help with and some of them were

414
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:44,530
developed for that reason all right so a

415
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,560
little bit about the testing methods

416
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,680
what I did so I just did some research I

417
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,660
installed and ran a certain technique

418
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,340
which I'll talk about and then I started

419
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,490
documenting what I found some cases I

420
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:58,960
did contribute to the open source

421
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,820
projects and many cases I also

422
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,140
interviewed the primary project

423
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,920
contributor I utilized detection lab

424
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:09,580
which is a fantastic discovery for me it

425
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:12,970
has four servers Windows Linux actually

426
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:14,850
three windows and a Linux server

427
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:17,320
included domain it's got all the free

428
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,650
really cool lab environment I also

429
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,540
discovered vagrant which was

430
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,430
mind-blowing discovery for me it was

431
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:27,880
super easy to set up a VirtualBox

432
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,730
environment with just a few commands and

433
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,740
you got yourself a lab was pretty really

434
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:37,900
cool so we're going to look at for each

435
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,270
one of these we i ran a example

436
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:42,600
technique this technique actually is

437
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,490
utilized and examples through many of

438
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:47,490
these tools it seems like to be a

439
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:49,960
standard for a lot of the tool sets and

440
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,330
how they explain how the tools work all

441
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:54,130
it is is it's a defense evasion

442
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:56,830
execution another way another way to

443
00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:01,000
execute an executable with with the

444
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,620
bypassing without actually running an

445
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,050
executable so register for 32 if you

446
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:07,540
read anything read the read but it's a

447
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:12,640
way to execute something all right show

448
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,350
you the tools let's go so we're gonna go

449
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,750
through I added purple team attack

450
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,510
automation framework onto in addition to

451
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:24,010
what you're seeing in the agenda and the

452
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:26,050
orders somewhat shows an evolution of

453
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:29,370
the tools so starting from his

454
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:32,850
from earlier developed to kind of very

455
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:36,179
current all right

456
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:40,110
endgame RTA so just a little bit about

457
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:42,120
the format the highlights is just kind

458
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,629
of some points a different difference

459
00:19:44,629 --> 00:19:46,470
but I'm just going to talk through them

460
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:47,879
I also have some screenshots to show you

461
00:19:47,879 --> 00:19:50,999
the tool set so some interesting facts

462
00:19:50,999 --> 00:19:55,110
about are ta Devon ker is the author our

463
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,580
primary author I actually went to

464
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,720
college with him I know him real well

465
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:02,070
and great guy and so he developed this

466
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:05,279
tool out of end game security software

467
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:09,450
product development and so it's it is a

468
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:12,720
locally ran framework there's no agent

469
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,389
there's no server or remote access tool

470
00:20:14,389 --> 00:20:17,429
it's basically it's on a runs off a

471
00:20:17,429 --> 00:20:20,399
Python core just simply just Python

472
00:20:20,399 --> 00:20:23,129
scripts the tests do include the

473
00:20:23,129 --> 00:20:25,649
binaries and executables and what's nice

474
00:20:25,649 --> 00:20:29,519
about it it's it's pretty simple but

475
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:32,330
again it's it came out of end game

476
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:35,909
product developers really one of the

477
00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:40,950
best uses for this tool here is some I

478
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:43,440
think it's a Python code for this test

479
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,850
and you see there the Reg server 32

480
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,080
you're going to see this line and

481
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,759
several the example codes that I show

482
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:50,970
you

483
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:52,850
very similar commands are executed

484
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:56,610
you'll also know some cleanup there and

485
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:59,720
whether they're not if the tasks this

486
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,759
framework executes snoke pad upon a

487
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:05,639
successful test some other ones an

488
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:08,460
execute calc by default but this is all

489
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,399
changeable with its scripts but this is

490
00:21:11,399 --> 00:21:13,649
a yeah the yam oh yeah Mel's uh no no

491
00:21:13,649 --> 00:21:18,480
you know what that's Python the next

492
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,330
tool is meta this was authored by Chris

493
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:25,289
Gates who out of uber he was it probably

494
00:21:25,289 --> 00:21:26,879
could have been the first popular tool

495
00:21:26,879 --> 00:21:29,340
of its kind being in the given that the

496
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:32,059
fact that it ran as an agent

497
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:34,590
specifically the the biggest difference

498
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:38,549
of meta is its architecture it was it

499
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:40,379
utilized somewhat of a actually a

500
00:21:40,379 --> 00:21:42,269
client-server relationship but it

501
00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:43,980
utilizes vague

502
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:48,120
which is very interesting the reason why

503
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,890
I was developed was to help uber

504
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,960
security team close the alert loop

505
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,760
really I trying to automate that

506
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,900
detection in reporting in one without

507
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,170
any manual intervention it is a

508
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:04,740
python-based it runs off a Redis celery

509
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,370
server adversaries are simulated through

510
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:11,840
a scenario scripts of many actions and

511
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,850
the executables are not included by

512
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:18,900
belief they are typically downloaded as

513
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:23,220
a test is initiated as I mentioned

514
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:27,410
vagrants required vagrant is the rat and

515
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:30,090
very good for cloud infrastructure as a

516
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:32,180
service because it because it supports

517
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:35,580
vagrants a lot of practical uses for

518
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,200
improving your cyber assessment and

519
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,930
hunting programs just because it was

520
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:41,820
intended to build to close that alert

521
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:45,810
loop so the architecture again is the

522
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:47,520
the biggest difference with this tool

523
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,920
set so you got your meta server at the

524
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,560
top which works and issues and

525
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,820
integrates with vagrant to issue

526
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,040
commands down to each of the hosts in

527
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:00,770
your VirtualBox or VMware environments

528
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:05,910
there's some screenshots on the left

529
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,890
hand side there is the configuration in

530
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:11,640
the integration with your vagrant hosts

531
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,160
so you list your hosts and you list your

532
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,920
location of where your vagrant scripts

533
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,590
and files are located and on the right

534
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:23,400
is and of the ammo file I think he ammo

535
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,960
is not your markup language it's a very

536
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,140
readable type of markup language and

537
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,090
there you see command exe with reg

538
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:33,060
server 32 and a reference dll very

539
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,640
similar for forty-one one and seven very

540
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,010
similar execution from the first

541
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:45,390
framework but you also see other in the

542
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,450
code you all see other information meta

543
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:51,300
literally meta information in the the

544
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,290
code you have the reference to

545
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:55,110
techniques descriptions some decent

546
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:57,679
decent information

547
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:02,670
here's an execution of a this is

548
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:04,530
actually not the execution of t11 seven

549
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,870
but this is an execution of just a mo

550
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:08,250
file that's called on target that just

551
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:11,100
runs a bunch of net user net view net

552
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:14,070
group commands and just runs it on the

553
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:21,060
box and here is a report of the the

554
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,520
output of that command and the commands

555
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,680
that were ran is there it gives you the

556
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:31,050
time and the action the other thing

557
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:32,820
that's interesting about meta is that it

558
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,700
does they did build a slack integration

559
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,850
to help again to help close that alert

560
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:44,040
loop to integrate with other tools all

561
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:44,840
right

562
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:49,590
atomic Red Team next tool so atomic Red

563
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:53,040
Team was developed out of red red Canary

564
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,490
primary author there's Casey Smith they

565
00:24:56,490 --> 00:25:00,600
it's not necessarily an execution

566
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,820
framework for executing tools but it's

567
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:06,030
more known as a library in the largest

568
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:09,210
library of the tools available I'm sorry

569
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:11,310
the tests available they do have at

570
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,990
execution frameworks there's PowerShell

571
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:14,880
there's Python tool and there's a ruby

572
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,740
ruby tool that allows you to execute

573
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:24,030
these tests i the real benefit for these

574
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,260
with this that they're simple and

575
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,450
they're atomic they're there they run

576
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:29,070
within themselves there's really no

577
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:34,950
other binaries to download you you just

578
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,050
run the tool some of these as you notice

579
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:39,780
there there are four hundred

580
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,670
eighty-three tests but 182 covered

581
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:43,440
techniques so that means that there are

582
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,380
multiple tests per technique and you'll

583
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,620
see in the screenshot next of me running

584
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:52,680
the invoke red team execution framework

585
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:56,370
fraud of powershell adversary simulation

586
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:59,000
is manual once again they have a

587
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,800
scripting a sample script they call it

588
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,040
chain reactions but i think really all

589
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,100
they are just scripts to put tests

590
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,270
together and make decisions

591
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,130
I mentioned this largest largest

592
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:16,260
repository out there of tests and I

593
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,570
think I know I'm pretty sure the reason

594
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:20,790
why they have had so much support from

595
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:22,080
the community because their

596
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,090
documentation and their framework for

597
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:26,940
including the community is very very

598
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,880
well done it's very organized and very

599
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,930
good

600
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:33,420
I guess they give really good guidance

601
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,580
to how the community can support them

602
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,650
very good processes there for testing

603
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:41,550
and for inclusion if you want to develop

604
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:44,670
a test they really want the community to

605
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:47,040
help this framework because this

606
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,500
framework is utilized in other open

607
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,490
source frameworks this is a very good

608
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:55,170
tool to quick test your cyber controls

609
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:59,690
but it does support all the uses of

610
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:06,720
adversary simulation tool sets here's a

611
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,920
little bit about atomic Red Team and

612
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,430
it's in it's it's framework it really is

613
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:14,760
just a zip file you X you export it and

614
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,650
you have a bunch of folders that include

615
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:20,010
your tactics and inside each tactic

616
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:24,930
folder is a MD and a yamo file then you

617
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:28,040
also see a binary there

618
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,140
here's an example of t11 7 being

619
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,610
executed through the PowerShell

620
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:39,940
framework you see there that there are

621
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:42,670
three tests executed in its output I

622
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:45,880
believe this is a verbose output but one

623
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,120
two three of three for this test in my

624
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,660
lab I'm still not quite sure why calc

625
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:55,450
only executed three of two out of the

626
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:58,630
three times but hey it worked I was

627
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:04,270
really happy with the output here's a

628
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:07,180
little bit of some code the every

629
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:10,240
technique is very well documented and

630
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,210
every test is pretty well documented as

631
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:15,670
well so at the top is just a summary of

632
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:17,770
what this test is and at the bottom is

633
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:19,780
one to test one two three a little bit

634
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,940
about each test that's R and within that

635
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,280
technique I'm pretty sure there's a way

636
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:27,640
to execute a specific test within a

637
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:34,210
technique I just didn't get there so

638
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:38,970
here's actual code from atomic read team

639
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:43,510
there's your command but also have as

640
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:46,210
the yamo file again vary a lot like meta

641
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:49,300
and it's the mo information gives you

642
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,010
some information about the technique on

643
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:54,280
actually executing the test description

644
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:58,870
of the test and that's one one of the

645
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:06,370
three tests within that amo file and I

646
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,290
really like the documentation is on the

647
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:11,200
wiki as well that same documentation is

648
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,100
available also on the get wiki page for

649
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:20,980
atomic Red Team this is a little bit

650
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,840
showing a little bit about the chain

651
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:27,010
reaction scripts again they are just

652
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:29,500
simply scripts execute executing

653
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:34,540
multiple atomic tests and the thing

654
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,250
about adversary simulation is it

655
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:41,440
requires decisions to be made throughout

656
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,190
the throughout testing the cyber kill

657
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:46,100
chain

658
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,050
but this these decisions would have to

659
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:50,570
be manually scripted you if utilizing

660
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:57,830
atomic red team all right caldera and

661
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:58,850
this is probably one of the most

662
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:01,760
exciting frameworks so we're getting

663
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,740
more exciting as we go along through the

664
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:07,100
framework for these tool sets so caldera

665
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,410
was developed and supported by the MITRE

666
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:13,550
Corp specifically David hunt he his team

667
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:17,090
are really wanting this toolset to be a

668
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:18,710
framework for automated Red Team

669
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:21,320
operations they want to automate the

670
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,670
testing focusing on post compromised

671
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:28,220
tests there is a 2.0 version the

672
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,170
screenshots your is going to see are the

673
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:31,910
one auto version included it from the

674
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:34,190
detection lab I just did not get a

675
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:37,850
chance to do that to try out the 2.0 but

676
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:40,610
functionality you know they want its a

677
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:44,210
GUI typically GUI its point-and-click

678
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:46,520
adversary simulation they want to make

679
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,680
it very easy to install very easy to use

680
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,490
they want to bring your own technique

681
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:54,050
they want that capability actually they

682
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:55,750
have that capability

683
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:58,640
they don't want programming experience

684
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,970
you look to required they have a new

685
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:04,280
open plug-in architecture that's at the

686
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,250
released in the 2.0 you get to bring

687
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:09,610
your own rat or client-server

688
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:13,730
relationship tool or how you execute

689
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:15,740
commands on on a host you could do that

690
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:19,190
in multiple different ways there's also

691
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:21,200
some very smart planning capabilities

692
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,080
through artificial intelligence which is

693
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,570
really really cool supports multiple

694
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:29,420
devices I think this is the most mature

695
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,900
open-source framework I've seen however

696
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,120
that's the development activity on

697
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,940
caldera is very high and it's a good

698
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,470
thing because they're making it better

699
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:42,080
but with the 2.0 and one dodo are very

700
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,080
very different so just know that mitre

701
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,370
is certainly supported because obviously

702
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:50,270
it came from mitre the best practical

703
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,950
use is the support purple team testing

704
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,210
so you would have this installed in your

705
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:56,300
environment and probably in a dev

706
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,640
environment to test your cyber controls

707
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,370
and

708
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:01,440
prove an assessment performing threat

709
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,500
hunts utilizing this this framer but a

710
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,520
majority is that the majority of the

711
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,900
practical best practical use for this

712
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,850
tool is actually supporting the process

713
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:14,790
of adversary simulation so adversaries

714
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:16,200
simulated there you've seen that I have

715
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,090
some numbers there

716
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:20,220
I put variable for this one because it

717
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:23,790
is a like a point-and-click of defining

718
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:25,559
your adversary it's make it really easy

719
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:27,809
where other tools utilize scripts to

720
00:32:27,809 --> 00:32:30,480
make decisions this tool it's it's

721
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,740
point-and-click it's really nice

722
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:36,900
reporting's very very good good GUI as

723
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:42,600
well alright so caldera you know it was

724
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,640
originally developed by the defenders

725
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,260
but David Hunt and The MITRE team have

726
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,059
been really pushing and utilizing into

727
00:32:51,059 --> 00:32:53,309
their offensive space which is really

728
00:32:53,309 --> 00:32:56,550
cool if you want to learn more about

729
00:32:56,550 --> 00:33:00,020
caldera and the 2.0 version there's a

730
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,490
article by David called automated

731
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:04,679
adversary emulation I'm sorry it's a

732
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:07,050
YouTube video automated adversary

733
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:08,910
emulation available very good run

734
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:11,940
through this tool very technical of the

735
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:16,320
version 2.0 so here we go this is

736
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,960
caldera one dot oh this is now known as

737
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,820
the legacy interface and again I just

738
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:24,059
didn't get a chance or time to because

739
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:25,559
the two dotto version was recently

740
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:28,860
published but it works very similar the

741
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,840
concepts you're going to see are very

742
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:36,840
similar to the two dotto here is your

743
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,590
point and click adversary definition you

744
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:43,170
see there you can select which

745
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:45,059
techniques you want to add in your

746
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:47,730
adversary I titled my adversary bad

747
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:50,580
v-dog ATP 1 2 3 just just to you know

748
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:53,070
play with it and you just point and

749
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,809
click and select which have techniques

750
00:33:54,809 --> 00:33:56,220
that you want to utilize throughout your

751
00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:00,990
tests successfully executing a test

752
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:03,270
looks like this this is a visual of a

753
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:05,790
compromised network each of these hosts

754
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:09,000
with in my lab environment had the

755
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,270
caldera agent on it the one auto does

756
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:13,110
have an

757
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:16,560
agents but also and that agent will then

758
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,659
execute whatever test is on that system

759
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:23,940
but this this is just showing a properly

760
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:27,780
compromised Network after I think

761
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,100
believe that's after an attack is

762
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:34,110
executed so 2.0 notable features I think

763
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,730
I mentioned that well the new version

764
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:39,719
has a new Python core control center and

765
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:41,790
I think one of the coolest things of

766
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:44,090
this tool is the ability to automate

767
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:46,500
planning and an intelligent technique

768
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:50,219
chaining it's super super cool

769
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:53,580
it utilizes AI scoring for the technique

770
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,770
for the next technique chain so

771
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:57,840
throughout the technique chain it could

772
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,240
depending on what techniques that you

773
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,920
seem you want to simulate through your

774
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,690
adversary after you define it adversary

775
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:06,570
the definition and how it decides to do

776
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:09,300
which technique next is super smart and

777
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:13,800
it's kind of scary in a way you also

778
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,210
have the ability to define your own

779
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:17,310
logic to how you want to sim how you

780
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:18,840
want to how you want your technique

781
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,360
chaining to work or your next

782
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,040
your decisions that you're made that are

783
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,420
made very very cool stuff

784
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,130
it does support bring your own technique

785
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:30,960
it does support the atomic Red Team

786
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:35,370
framework and all 483 tests you could

787
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:36,810
bring your own remote access tool what

788
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:38,520
comes out of the box is a rat called

789
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,910
sand cat and utilized there's some other

790
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:43,500
plugins with caldera that's that are

791
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:47,340
really cool I again I believe the

792
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:49,200
intention of this is to help the plug in

793
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,420
one of the intentions is to help close

794
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:55,290
that alert loop hopefully someday there

795
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:58,710
will be a plug-in that does that okay

796
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:01,800
and finally the last toolset to talk

797
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,930
we're talking about today is the purple

798
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:05,880
team attack automation framework it is

799
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,080
one of the newest of open-source

800
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,280
adversary simulation tool sets out there

801
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,800
it was just recently Rini released very

802
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,370
new it's pretty simple if you know

803
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:19,950
Metasploit it's a clone of Metasploit

804
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:23,430
that includes references to post

805
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:25,830
exploitation modules

806
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:33,480
as tests as tests the rat or their the

807
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,220
client-server relationship actually is a

808
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,650
matter Pradesh L so you have to get

809
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:40,020
meterpreter to execute on your host and

810
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,870
then it communicates with your client

811
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:48,270
MSF she'll our instance and but really

812
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:50,730
the best practical use for this is the

813
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:53,190
support purple teaming testing because

814
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:56,100
the Metasploit is more of a red teaming

815
00:36:56,100 --> 00:37:00,480
tool I feel like it it's easy for a

816
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,420
penetration tester to help with that and

817
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,160
proving the cyber steps assessment

818
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,200
threat hunting processes it does have a

819
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,870
hundred tests that comes with it out of

820
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:12,090
the box but it doesn't really do

821
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:14,880
adversary simulation but I still think

822
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,690
it's pretty cool because it utilizes

823
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:18,810
Metasploit and interpreter so here's

824
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:23,400
some examples of mess plate and when you

825
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,400
do a search on purple it comes up with

826
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,620
all your test techniques see they're

827
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:30,150
categorized there by your mitre tech

828
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:38,730
techniques there's t 1 1 1 7 and then

829
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:40,980
here is an example of a matter

830
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,770
procession I think it's a reverse TCP

831
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:49,230
shell connected to your Metasploit

832
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:53,270
console that is required for this and

833
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:56,460
here is once you are connected with this

834
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:59,160
session you can utilize and use a

835
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,710
certain technique you just list out the

836
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:04,290
technique you notice there that there's

837
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:06,780
some cleanup there you could set cleanup

838
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,340
flags the yes or no whether or not you

839
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,710
want to clean up the the files that are

840
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:13,220
left there but there's your execution of

841
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:17,700
T one one seven register over 32 dll and

842
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,910
then on a certain meterpreter session

843
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:23,460
and you can notice that it found calc

844
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:26,010
and it's running it and the test was

845
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,930
successful so this framework actually

846
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,330
identifies whether calc was actually ran

847
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:33,529
or not which is a good function

848
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:38,190
okay let's talk a little bit about the

849
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,960
future of these tools these are kind of

850
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,440
what I'm seeing these tool sets may do

851
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,730
and it's just kind of some it's just

852
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:47,160
some thoughts you know we have

853
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,290
seventy-five percent coverage of tests

854
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:53,160
right now we're starting to near I guess

855
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:56,370
all the 244 tests there were about 75%

856
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:58,230
covered of all of tests able to be

857
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:01,710
simulated I'm gonna see I know there are

858
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:03,840
some tests and tech techniques out there

859
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,370
that I'm sorry there are some techniques

860
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:06,840
out there there are just not testable

861
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:11,850
due to the technical nature or unknown

862
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:14,640
technical nature of each test but we're

863
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,250
starting the near 100% coverage of all

864
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:22,020
the testable or simulate able attacks I

865
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,940
know that there's commercial software

866
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,350
out there and I didn't do any research

867
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:26,430
so if you have any questions about

868
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,280
commercial software I just don't know

869
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:32,370
but we're gonna probably see more of

870
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:36,030
that I think we should also see the

871
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:40,020
closing the alert Gloop alert loop fixed

872
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:43,190
and automating that through the future

873
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:47,820
versions of these tools also would

874
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:50,280
expect to see some integration with some

875
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,260
commercial or public intelligence feeds

876
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:55,170
that include adversary behaviors and

877
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:59,100
identify adversaries I think we are all

878
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:02,190
seeing a better adoption to smiter

879
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:04,680
attack techniques and TT technique

880
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,870
mappings within security products so

881
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:10,110
when a certain for example EDR product

882
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:11,360
when a certain

883
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,890
tactic is I'm sorry technique is

884
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:16,290
identified that the output of that

885
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:18,570
technique that T one one one seven would

886
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:23,210
be in the output of the log that way

887
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:28,080
that way we would be able to close that

888
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,529
alert loop

889
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:34,010
I'm gonna see we're gonna see increased

890
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:36,200
adversary I expect to see increased

891
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,200
adversary simulation functionality

892
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,910
within security products possibly within

893
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:42,910
themselves or possibly like a side tool

894
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:45,530
to test their own stuff provided to

895
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:48,020
customers I don't know how much you

896
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:55,730
would trust that but it's possibility we

897
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:59,630
also I also expect to see the ability to

898
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:01,910
emulate and simulate manual non

899
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:03,380
technical techniques within a toolset

900
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:06,290
I'll think with a lot of the scriptable

901
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:09,410
one tool sets that that's fairly easy to

902
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:11,210
do you just have to do some scripting

903
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:13,430
but I haven't really seen the ability to

904
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:15,230
if you want to do a fish test for

905
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,520
example or do something in the middle

906
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:19,640
within the technique kill a cyber kill

907
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,600
chain

908
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,660
there's not really a spot to do so it's

909
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:26,420
just more manual I would like to see

910
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:28,760
more I think we expect to see more and

911
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,640
more consultants and service providers

912
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:35,690
to provide simulated hunt assessments or

913
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:40,960
threat hunting utilizing these tools I

914
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,550
also expect to see penetration tests

915
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:45,920
tooling possibly like purple attack team

916
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,380
purple team attacking automation to

917
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,060
include mitre references and more and

918
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:52,730
more tools like purple team to include

919
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:55,340
that capability and possibly the

920
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:57,790
functionality to test whether or not or

921
00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:00,370
to integrate with a sim or EDR

922
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:02,780
out-of-the-box to close that alert loop

923
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:06,200
I know there's some concerns regarding

924
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:11,000
for some tooling like EDR vendors that

925
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,200
actually detect that develop detection

926
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:17,960
alerts and techniques from their tool

927
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,480
sets that only catch simulation tools

928
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,120
being executed so beyond a be on a

929
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,760
lookout for some I guess some products

930
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:31,130
that only look for the tests that run

931
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:32,420
within these simulation tools that

932
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:34,490
specifically red canary just to get a

933
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:38,230
higher rating on there

934
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:41,470
their software you know through third

935
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:47,380
parties and such all right that is my

936
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:57,339
presentation thank you very much so we

937
00:42:57,339 --> 00:43:00,220
have a few minutes does anybody have any

938
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:07,810
questions or comments no questions or

939
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:14,430
comments yes

940
00:43:20,369 --> 00:43:23,569
we'll useful for what

941
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:34,270
in my environment well my environment is

942
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:38,620
a so the question is which toolset

943
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:41,470
do you believe was works best in my

944
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:46,180
environment and it really depends what

945
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:46,840
you want to do

946
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,900
I think atomic red team was a very

947
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,670
simple one that many people can utilize

948
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:54,340
and execute they actually have a script

949
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,440
with in atomic that as a script that

950
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:59,530
runs all tests I did provide some

951
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:01,890
feedback about that script about

952
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:04,210
initiating delays and output and the

953
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:06,490
time so you can run this all the tests

954
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:09,010
and then go back into your your sim or

955
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:12,100
EDR and go look at later I typically

956
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,140
think atomic red team is fairly good

957
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:15,660
place to start

958
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:23,560
you're welcome any other questions all

959
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,240
right thank you so much enjoy the rest

960
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,270
of your day at besides Pittsburgh

961
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:32,449
[Applause]
