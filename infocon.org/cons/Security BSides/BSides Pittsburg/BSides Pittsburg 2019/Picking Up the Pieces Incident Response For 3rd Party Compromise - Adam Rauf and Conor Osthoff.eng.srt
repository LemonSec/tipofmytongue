spending too much money on scheme sales

22
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:04,589
several of these I can relate to Conner

23
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:06,810
ostrov is a senior Incident Response

24
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,390

he possesses a proven track record of

27
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,450
responding to compromises of all shapes

28
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,870
and sizes he is an avid hiker and autumn

00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:23,310
their automobile enthusiast and finds

30
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,320
enjoyment and difficult challenges both

31
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,560
inside the office and outside of it

32
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,230
Connor currently holds G AK certified

33
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:34,710

mobile dev analyst device analyst

35
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,410
certification as well so with that being

36
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,240
said I'll go ahead hand things over to

37
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,220
you guys and go ahead get started

38
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:54,130
good morning Thank You Zack for the

39
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:57,130
introduction so I guess we can actually

40
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:58,810
go right into the talk and skip probably

41
00:01:58,810 --> 00:01:59,920
the introduction slide because we

42
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,630
already got that information but I'm

43
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:02,439
Adam roof

44
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:04,869
this is Conner ah stuff we're giving our

45
00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:06,549
talk here on picking up the pieces which

46
00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:08,169
is Incident Response for third-party

47
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:12,040
compromise so this is some of the stuff

48
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,239
you guys already know so we're just

49
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:16,209
gonna move on from there the legal mumbo

50
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:17,709
jumbo of course the opinions expressed

51
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:19,150
by us this morning do not necessarily

52
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,950
express the views and thoughts of our

53
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,349
employer etc etc I think we've all kind

54
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:24,519
of been through this in every

55
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:28,569
presentation definitely familiar so the

56
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:29,950
scope why are you here today it's

57
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,079
probably because you work in security to

58
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,940
some capacity you find yourself as an

59
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,560
information security analyst and you

60
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,269
respond to breaches you work data

61
00:02:37,269 --> 00:02:39,400
breaches things of that nature or you

62
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,170
are a privacy legal official who is

63
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,730
worried about that sort of thing and as

64
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:47,410
I think they are you may handle with

65
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,790
data that comes into your organization

66
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:52,349
and you want to secure it as well if

67
00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:54,670
you're worried about how individuals

68
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:55,989
working with your data are actually

69
00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:57,459
treating your data then this talk is for

70
00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:01,810
you as well so we're gonna make this a

71
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,910
little bit more interactive right in

72
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,470
talking to many of you who work in

73
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,599
security in different capacities you

74
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,010
guys can just shout out a couple of

75
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,660
things what are some of the first things

76
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,220
you do whenever you find out that

77
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,760
there's an incident in your network take

78
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,760
it off the network

79
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,150
anyone else would panic okay I like that

80
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:27,329
what's not bad no do that what was that

81
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:34,450
yeah so what's that call your chain of

82
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:35,319
command that's good

83
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:37,810
yes imperative so we'll talk through

84
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,130
some of the things that we've seen is

85
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:40,300
the first party and then kind of talk

86
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,770
through what you do as a third party

87
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,200
right so a lot of you are probably

88
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,700
familiar with the sans pickerel model

89
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,700
this is one that a lot of it as a

90
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,170
shion's have adopted looking at

91
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:53,080
preparation preparing for any type of

92
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,370
incident that comes in the organization

93
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,310
identifying the incident as it comes in

94
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,530
containing it eradicating it recovery

95
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,330
and most importantly and it's usually

96
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,520
skipped over as lessons learned having

97
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,459
those after-action reports you probably

98
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:08,140
review your logs you're looking at

99
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:11,560
firewall logs proxy logs AV EDR if you

100
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,060
have it system logs DLP mail gateway if

101
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:20,048
you have an IDs or IPs and I think Jay

102
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:21,519
touched on this earlier but training

103
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,590
communications so if you need to reach

104
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:26,290
out to your C cert if you have a

105
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,030
particular chain of command you're gonna

106
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,640
follow in a lot of cases even in our in

107
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,590
our environment we usually reach out to

108
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,630
privacy because we like to make them

109
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,370
aware of any incident in case it has

110
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:38,350
privacy leanings you might reach out to

111
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,120
your legal counsel

112
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,460
hree are depending on you know what the

113
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,590
type of scenario is you'll probably talk

114
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,180
to somebody within the do that disaster

115
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,430
recovery space or within corporate

116
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,229
resilience and there's probably even

117
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:54,340
more than that in my place of employment

118
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,560
we use the pickerel motto in a sort of

119
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,630
forked variant so to start things off we

120
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,760
have the discover phase that's the point

121
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,740
in time where the event is generated the

122
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,120
work is a sign of the appropriate

123
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,790
parties and the escalation occurs if it

124
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:09,580
is needed in the investigation scoping

125
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,169
phase the second ones we have here our

126
00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:13,210
event monitoring team spends about an

127
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:14,830
hour's worth of time to triage the event

128
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,560
gather different feelings on the types

129
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,240
of data that are associated with it and

130
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,280
try to build a case from that if a true

131
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,430
positive is I don't know

132
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,949
then escalation occurs at that point as

133
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:28,370
well it is logged within the incident

134
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,830
response ticketing platform and an

135
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,509
escalation to the incident response and

136
00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:34,370
forensics team occurs at this phase as

137
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:34,840
well

138
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,190
communication with privacy if needed

139
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,560
also happens if there is a cyber

140
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,639
security incident with a privacy

141
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,020
implication we absolutely want to have

142
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,300
them involved and lastly for this phase

143
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,550
we hold in what we call an IRT meeting

144
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,020
so an incident response team meeting

145
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,310
kind of gathers all the people from

146
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,979
Caesar to get them all together have

147
00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:53,539
everybody on the same page and progress

148
00:05:53,539 --> 00:05:56,000
from that point so after we discovered

149
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,039
the incident we understand the full

150
00:05:58,039 --> 00:05:59,240
scope of the incident we've made sure

151
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,470
that we're not missing anything we've

152
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,510
began working on containment so we

153
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,460
analyze the criteria for containment we

154
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,900
start to build our containment plan and

155
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,000
then after we determined a plan we have

156
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,740
the necessary sign-offs we implement

157
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,199
that containment plan once it has been

158
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:13,729
implemented we verify the effectiveness

159
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:15,470
and we make sure that we're not seeing

160
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:19,010
the same types of activity the

161
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:20,870
eradication and mitigation phase which

162
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,180
is the next one here we plan and execute

163
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,280
our remediation actions we determine all

164
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,960
activities we assign all of the

165
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,310
appropriate resources to those

166
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,590
activities and the appropriate

167
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,099
communications happen here as well

168
00:06:33,099 --> 00:06:35,810
the impacts of the eradication of

169
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:38,000
mitigation plan are assessed and the

170
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,620
effectiveness is evaluated if we find

171
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,630
that we have implemented this plan and

172
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:45,440
we still do not have for mediation then

173
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,930
we go ahead and reorganize our plan to

174
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,289
keep those gaps in mind afterwards the

175
00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:53,210
recovery phase so if the eradication and

176
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,190
mitigation phase caused any issues we

177
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,949
work diligently to restore normal

178
00:06:57,949 --> 00:06:59,720
business operations and that's likewise

179
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,000
for the implications of the cyber

180
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,120
incident itself we generate an incident

181
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,520
report and deliver that report to the

182
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,720
necessary individuals and we changed the

183
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,419
incident to closure status and lastly

184
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:16,460
here we have the follow-up phase where

185
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,800
we identify and review our lessons

186
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,199
learned we begin long term corrective

187
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,580
action and kind of keep all of those

188
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,620
things in mind moving forward pick those

189
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,300
gaps out and make sure that we're not

190
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,530
susceptible to them again in the future

191
00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:33,319
okay so here are some of the don'ts of a

192
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,969
first party incident so if you're the

193
00:07:34,969 --> 00:07:36,439
organization that suffers the incident

194
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:38,389
or you happen to be the third party of

195
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:41,029
an organization that you handle first

196
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:43,969
party for one of the first things is you

197
00:07:43,969 --> 00:07:46,369
don't ever lie to your customers if you

198
00:07:46,369 --> 00:07:47,809
have work to do

199
00:07:47,809 --> 00:07:49,729
if you need to figure out what's going

200
00:07:49,729 --> 00:07:52,369
on don't tell people that you're going

201
00:07:52,369 --> 00:07:53,659
to have everything resolved within a

202
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:54,949
couple of days if you need a week to

203
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:57,679
figure it out don't trust the assurances

204
00:07:57,679 --> 00:07:59,360
you receive from criminals there are

205
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,339
many cases where things like ransomware

206
00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:03,649
of head organizations and what they go

207
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,209
back and say is well if I pay the ransom

208
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:07,729
they'll give me my data back right in a

209
00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:09,289
lot of cases that doesn't occur conner

210
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:10,399
we'll talk a little bit more about that

211
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:13,069
in a moment don't promise upfront

212
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:14,509
answers to your customers if you can't

213
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:16,849
deliver so once again if you say that

214
00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:18,649
you know we'll have all systems restored

215
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:20,479
within the next 24 hours and it takes

216
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,969
twenty-five hours that first hour right

217
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:24,259
afterward your customers are gonna say

218
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:26,509
these guys lied to me and it's going to

219
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:28,269
ruin the faith in your organization

220
00:08:28,269 --> 00:08:30,769
finally don't blame one person for an

221
00:08:30,769 --> 00:08:33,409
organizational wide failure if there's

222
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:36,110
an issue that occurs a compromise that

223
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:38,029
occurs within your organization go back

224
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:40,159
and actually take a look at is this a

225
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,139
people problem is this a process problem

226
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:44,089
is this a documentation problem is it

227
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:46,130
training is any any of those things

228
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:48,410
because yes we are always going to have

229
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,779
a weak link with with humans OSI layer a

230
00:08:50,779 --> 00:08:52,970
right but at the end of the day if

231
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:55,279
something else caused it and caused that

232
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,990
person to make the mistake try to go

233
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,459
back and understand the root cause and

234
00:08:58,459 --> 00:09:00,199
that's a big part of the lessons learned

235
00:09:00,199 --> 00:09:03,139
piece on the topic of assurances from

236
00:09:03,139 --> 00:09:05,029
criminals I think this incident is

237
00:09:05,029 --> 00:09:06,529
familiar to most of us we've seen in

238
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:09,439
2016 it was not fully reported until the

239
00:09:09,439 --> 00:09:13,100
end of 2017 it was a it was a large

240
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,220
company by the name of uber and about 57

241
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,600
million records if I'm remembering

242
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,139
correctly the implications of this are

243
00:09:21,139 --> 00:09:23,000
the threat actor had this data reached

244
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,860
out to the organization and essentially

245
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,269
said hey I have this what are we gonna

246
00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:29,779
do about it so they think through

247
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:31,759
different plans what can we do and they

248
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:34,610
decide that don't turn into a ransomware

249
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,709
case they will bribe the attacker will

250
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:39,050
pay you a hundred thousand dollars if

251
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,639
you keep quiet and then let us know that

252
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:40,980
we

253
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,139
have anything to worry about so they did

254
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:46,500
such actions they took faith in the

255
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,570
assurances that the criminals or the

256
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:51,240
attackers had provided them and this fee

257
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,220
was paid seeing as it made its way to

258
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,170
headlines its I think it speaks for

259
00:09:55,170 --> 00:10:00,000
itself so going on to how to handle a

260
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,510
third party incident I think the things

261
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,040
on the slide here we've all probably

262
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,990
tried it at some point sometimes giving

263
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:09,930
to our own frustration but if your

264
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,430
experiences or anything like mine they

265
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,230
don't tend to help you very much so

266
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,089
we'll go into a few things in detail of

267
00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:16,829
how we can respond to these types of

268
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:21,060
problems so the first step is prevention

269
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,070
you can't fall for a phishing scam if

270
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,110
you don't check your email you can't

271
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,850
have a third party compromised if you

272
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,410
don't work with any third parties so

273
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,060
let's just stop working with third

274
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,680
parties altogether it'd be a good idea

275
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,380
right well the world's not like that

276
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,420
anymore with the way that people are

277
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,100
moving into cloud the way that people

278
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,199
are outsourcing some of their work we

279
00:10:40,199 --> 00:10:42,690
can't really do that and so a big part

280
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:45,389
of that is trust so we are at this point

281
00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:47,880
trusting people we pay to do a job

282
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,550
cheaper out of house which means they're

283
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,920
going to cut corners in a couple of

284
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,810
cases as we get later on to the horror

285
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:57,120
stories is that we've met with many

286
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,649
third-party organizations where we ask

287
00:10:58,649 --> 00:11:00,839
them for their security folks and they

288
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:02,819
don't have any it's usually one person

289
00:11:02,819 --> 00:11:06,839
who works probably you know 70 80 hours

290
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:09,660
a week doing all of the IT work as well

291
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,639
as having to do security so when an

292
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:13,350
incident occurs they are totally burned

293
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:15,839
out and oftentimes they don't have

294
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,050
anybody on retainer so that's you know

295
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,120
unfortunate and we see that with a lot

296
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,519
of organizations another thing to think

297
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,019
about is putting as much distance as you

298
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:28,110
can between you and your vendors and

299
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,819
third parties so if they have

300
00:11:29,819 --> 00:11:32,100
connections into your network to FA or

301
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,010
MFA definitely a good idea limited

302
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:37,079
access so principally fleece privilege

303
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:39,779
we see a lot of cases where vendors will

304
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:40,600
have ad

305
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,899
access or direct RDP access to devices

306
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:45,880
they're not segmented they're not on a

307
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,819
VLAN so network segmentation tying into

308
00:11:48,819 --> 00:11:50,560
that and then the other important part

309
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,060
is logging everything within that

310
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,370
network we've seen a case where there

311
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,779
was a fire alarm system that was

312
00:11:55,779 --> 00:11:58,089
compromised and there were no logs of

313
00:11:58,089 --> 00:12:00,310
that fire alarm system so those are the

314
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,600
kinds of things that you want to be on

315
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,000
the lookout for and one other thing to

316
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,069
think about is that vendors and third

317
00:12:06,069 --> 00:12:07,990
parties will often have multiple clients

318
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:10,690
so in short they care about you just as

319
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:11,860
much as they care about their four

320
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:15,579
hundred other people when responding a

321
00:12:15,579 --> 00:12:17,529
third party compromised communication is

322
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:20,529
imperative you need to ensure that all

323
00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:22,240
internal members of c-cert understand

324
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,250
their roles so while the media relations

325
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,649
team is comfortable working with privacy

326
00:12:26,649 --> 00:12:27,790
and legal they might not necessarily

327
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:30,220
have the needs of corporate resiliency

328
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,240
in mind and they might not necessarily

329
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,759
understand all of the implications of

330
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:35,230
the cyber attacks that they can convey

331
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,180
it for a lot of these people who may be

332
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,769
spelled out in your cyber incident

333
00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:40,269
response plan they understand their

334
00:12:40,269 --> 00:12:41,769
roles and responsibilities on paper

335
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:43,329
acting the mountain person is a

336
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:45,130
completely different story usually we

337
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,569
find that for a lot of smaller

338
00:12:46,569 --> 00:12:48,699
organizations especially whenever there

339
00:12:48,699 --> 00:12:50,860
is a breach that needs to be disclosed

340
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,540
this is often the first time that any of

341
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,130
them are even in the same room talking

342
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:56,410
about it so if you already have one very

343
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:59,350
large fire it's better to have the fine

344
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,550
details and the finer points of

345
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,319
communication worked out beforehand to

346
00:13:02,319 --> 00:13:03,399
make sure that you're not Fanning those

347
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:04,750
flames in the chaos that you create

348
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,569
trying to start your response actions if

349
00:13:07,569 --> 00:13:11,709
you have a contract with the third party

350
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:14,579
and I would assume that you do it is

351
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:16,870
definitely a good idea to work with your

352
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,040
legal team and find out what you can

353
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,110
leverage contractually anything that can

354
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,089
give you extra power to make them do

355
00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:23,500
what you want which is give you a

356
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,970
comfortable feeling that the threat is

357
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,250
contained and resolved and explained

358
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,569
that you aren't willing to compromise if

359
00:13:28,569 --> 00:13:30,639
they still have an active threat if

360
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,889
there's still an active breach on their

361
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:35,589
network take a very firm standpoint and

362
00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:37,209
explain the normal business operations

363
00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:39,160
when I'll be resumed until that threat

364
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,339
is at least under control right so

365
00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:43,990
moving on to the next section this is

366
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,100
going to get a little bit on the drier

367
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,410
side but we actually developed an

368
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,100
in-house

369
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,020
party compromised checklists that we

370
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,870
worked on so Connor John Wolfram is

371
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,610
formerly on our team and many others

372
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:56,590
within our Incident Response space came

373
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:59,320
up with with a good practice for us to

374
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,120
follow every time we ask third parties

375
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,880
for their data whenever a incident has

376
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,520
occurred so this is kind of the

377
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,230
checklist that we use you guys probably

378
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,670
can adopt something very similar if you

379
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:12,250
haven't in your in your incident

380
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,930
response plans but we'll go through

381
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:16,180
these a little bit in depth so the first

382
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,070
thing we usually ask is on the left side

383
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:20,140
we start with requested items and on the

384
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,970
right side we ask them to identify where

385
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,500
they received it from which will include

386
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,870
the date of when the when they have the

387
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:28,060
logs from what kind of logs they gave us

388
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:31,060
and what platforms this touches so first

389
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,650
we start with the evidence of alert

390
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,510
detection so we ask them for you know

391
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:38,290
standard AV EA our hips ids/ips type

392
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:41,440
logs any network forensics artifacts

393
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,910
that they can share so that might be

394
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:46,210
NetFlow web logs pcap firewall logs

395
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:49,420
firewall configs email attachments all

396
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,680
system change controls and

397
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,690
configurations so this often gets

398
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:55,720
glossed over in in terms of a lot of

399
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,220
compromises there are cases where it

400
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,080
might be an access permissions issue of

401
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,850
something of that sort and if there's a

402
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,500
change record that's associated with it

403
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,750
we should be able to try to trace a why

404
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,700
did it happen and B when did it happen

405
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,710
to understand the entire scope and why

406
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:11,860
the dwell time is as large as it is we

407
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,480
also look for any endpoint forensics

408
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,340
artifacts so this might be log files or

409
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,250
evidence of ransomware or malware and so

410
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,960
in each of these sections we also ask

411
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,080
for any additional notes attachments if

412
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,850
they can give the sender and how they

413
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,410
transmitted this information to us

414
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:28,120
whether it's email a delivery or some

415
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,730
other method we also ask for evidence of

416
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,140
vulnerability scans so if they've done

417
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,880
any recent role in really scans and

418
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,950
there are third parties and vendors who

419
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,780
don't do vulnerability scans on any

420
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:40,090
regular basis but in the case that they

421
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:41,590
do we do ask them for this to identify

422
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:44,530
the scope of the detection and then if

423
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:46,750
they've got IOC scans that they can

424
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,640
share with us we look forward to that as

425
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,960
well any files that are modified by

426
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,210
malware or ransomware or anything else

427
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:57,370
are a classified as they're a portable

428
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:57,820
reach

429
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,250
under US law due to those things we ask

430
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,220
for the following DLP logs so evidence

431
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,140
that DLP is implemented and it was

432
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,860
implemented at the time of the intrusion

433
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:11,050
report evidence of any company data loss

434
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:12,520
to the company that you yourselves work

435
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,710
for provide the criteria that was used

436
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,600
to perform any DLT searches so that we

437
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,700
can review that criteria and determine

438
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,700
whether or not there the DLP logs have

439
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,820
the integrity that we would expect

440
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,020
malware identification we ask for

441
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,120
variants type version research data and

442
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,890
family so that we can understand all

443
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:32,200
facets of the threat that we're

444
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,860
currently facing on their behalf we ask

445
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,750
for forensic evidence as registry key

446
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,380
changes process hash downloaded files

447
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,460
command and control IPs and domains

448
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,290
installed locations propagation

449
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:46,480
techniques the exploits of is used and

450
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,040
any other pertinent IOC s

451
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,450
so that we can use those things to

452
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:51,550
search for evidence of that malware

453
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:54,010
operating in our environment we also ask

454
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:56,230
that attack vector and root cause be

455
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,540
documented in terms of payload delivery

456
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,790
so documenting the appropriate evidence

457
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,410
of that showing the appropriate logs so

458
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:03,490
that we understand the different phases

459
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,890
throughout the malware point of

460
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:08,260
infection and also propagation so

461
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,390
document exactly how the infection

462
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:12,430
spreads and how it did spread through

463
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:16,689
their network moving along we touch a

464
00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:18,250
little bit more on breach response so

465
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,650
asking them to provide evidence that no

466
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:22,930
company data has been modified or

467
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:26,589
exfiltrated each infected host in some

468
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:27,760
cases that might comment is an

469
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,590
attestation letter that's the

470
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,970
opportunity for them to either attach

471
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,920
that letter to it or speak directly to

472
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,520
privacy teams legal teams we also look

473
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,670
for evidences of a remediation plan we

474
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,740
have a couple of areas for this so one

475
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,540
is to maybe at least give us the logs of

476
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,310
the IOC scans that they have that would

477
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:48,310
validate that they've wiped and remove

478
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,290
the malware from the network we've run

479
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:52,090
into cases where the vendor gave us the

480
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:54,070
assurance that yes we've removed all

481
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:56,410
threats from the network only to be

482
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:57,950
reinfected only

483
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:00,769
weeks later we've also asked for

484
00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:03,139
documented mitigation plans so this is

485
00:18:03,139 --> 00:18:04,580
to prevent future infection this should

486
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:07,279
be the the problem management or the

487
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:09,230
after-action reports that come out of

488
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,179
this they should be giving us an

489
00:18:11,179 --> 00:18:13,429
understanding of why this happened how

490
00:18:13,429 --> 00:18:14,450
they're going to prevent this from

491
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:15,740
happening again

492
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,809
so we also ask them for things for

493
00:18:17,809 --> 00:18:19,549
example if the compromise came because

494
00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:23,029
of in on you know an unpatched system we

495
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:24,590
want evidence of what they're patching

496
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,330
schedule is and what they're using to

497
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,549
patch that particular exploit a

498
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:30,380
vulnerability scan so again if they

499
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,850
didn't have vulnerability scans in the

500
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:33,350
past we want them to begin a

501
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:35,360
vulnerability scan program and tell us

502
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,370
how often they're going to do it there's

503
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:38,929
a lot of free and open source tools

504
00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:40,549
available so it's not like they need to

505
00:18:40,549 --> 00:18:42,529
go and pay somebody to do it but if they

506
00:18:42,529 --> 00:18:44,510
can't that's also an opportunity for

507
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,580
them to bring somebody in to do it we

508
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,740
also ask for evidence that the network

509
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:51,350
protection stops propagation so did they

510
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:53,750
put in a VLAN did they do a layer 3

511
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,940
segmentation have they put any other

512
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,340
steps in place to prevent the infection

513
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,990
from hitting multiple systems and

514
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:02,480
networks that once again we also look

515
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,340
for a modification of protection and

516
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:07,279
detection vectors so that again once

517
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:08,750
again looking for a possibility of

518
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,000
reinfection so even if it got

519
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,010
compromised by you know and open

520
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:14,840
vulnerability and a pop3 server what are

521
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,899
you doing for that pop3 server and also

522
00:19:17,899 --> 00:19:19,399
what corrective action plans they're

523
00:19:19,399 --> 00:19:21,740
taking so I mentioned earlier that you

524
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,330
never really blame an organization-wide

525
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,399
failure on one person you should blame

526
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:27,649
it on what's going on with the process

527
00:19:27,649 --> 00:19:29,029
what's going on with the training what

528
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:31,309
was missed so if it is something like

529
00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:33,789
fishing okay well do you have a fishing

530
00:19:33,789 --> 00:19:36,440
training plan in place if it's something

531
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,169
where somebody you know accidentally set

532
00:19:39,169 --> 00:19:41,120
access permissions okay well are you

533
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,590
retraining that person on how that's

534
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,690
done are you putting additional controls

535
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:49,159
in are you putting in other technical

536
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:50,299
controls to prevent that from happening

537
00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:52,870
in the future

538
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,700
on top of all the things that we've

539
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,530
asked for so far we ask that everything

540
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,320
be included in an incident report so we

541
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,820
can send out that incident report to all

542
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,380
the different members in C cert who may

543
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,030
work with the security representatives

544
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,289
or the legal representatives of the

545
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,660
third party compromise at a different

546
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:13,049
capacity a breach response notification

547
00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:14,970
so the report that is provided to the

548
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:16,230
privacy department we have to make sure

549
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,549
that that meets all legal requirements

550
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,880
and also have our opportunity to feed

551
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,400
data into that as well if the type of

552
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,230
work that we do with that third party

553
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:28,530
requests such behavior and also to list

554
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:30,330
agents scheduled to work on the audits

555
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,980
requested in this document so we have

556
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,780
accountability for all of the things

557
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,520
that were provided here and if we have

558
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,960
later follow-up activities we know

559
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,580
exactly who we can take those topics to

560
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,010
so I mentioned earlier about the

561
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,840
networking logs at this point if they

562
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,549
can provide us with the actual pcaps

563
00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:50,039
or any of the actual log files we do ask

564
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:52,559
if they can include that ditto for IDs

565
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,150
and IPS logs so if they can give us

566
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,350
evidence of the payloads that they've

567
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:57,780
received also for any of the signatures

568
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,630
that they use to map this against we

569
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:03,330
requested at this time of course the

570
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:05,039
methodology for receiving this might not

571
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,600
be something that's as simple is you

572
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,309
know adding it to an email we might ask

573
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:10,260
them to send it via something like a

574
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:14,370
delivery or SFTP patient zero monitoring

575
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:16,559
so again we kind of go back to where did

576
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,539
the actual infection occur and how did

577
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:21,419
it occur can we look at was this tied to

578
00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:23,039
a particular account so if we look at

579
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,710
the case of a phishing incident did they

580
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,390
go back and reset the password for the

581
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:27,809
account

582
00:21:27,809 --> 00:21:30,000
did they give the user training are they

583
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,760
monitoring that account for more

584
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,919
potential activity in case the actor

585
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:37,190
remained persistent within the network

586
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:39,330
what's going on with their email are

587
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,679
there any other emails that are coming

588
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:43,169
in are they harvesting credentials is

589
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:45,270
there any strange web activity so

590
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,520
looking for things like C - are there

591
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,309
other malicious domains that the user is

592
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,169
still connecting to maybe unbeknownst to

593
00:21:52,169 --> 00:21:53,789
the user are their browser helper

594
00:21:53,789 --> 00:21:55,380
objects that are still remaining on the

595
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,510
system a comprehensive review of that

596
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:59,760
system as well as understanding if the

597
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,260
endpoint itself is infected what have

598
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,390
they done to wipe and reload it are they

599
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:05,429
doing you know a nuke from orbit

600
00:22:05,429 --> 00:22:07,860
approach and just seven past the ban on

601
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,200
it or are they just going to say we're

602
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,460
just gonna reinstall windows and hope

603
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,460
for the best we want that evidence for

604
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,290
the current AV status we want to

605
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:18,299
understand why the AV might have missed

606
00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:19,679
it so if there's a particular compromise

607
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,600
with a piece of malware we might say you

608
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,340
know what percentage of your hosts are

609
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,080
currently loaded with the version of AV

610
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,570
that you have how accurate are the

611
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:29,520
definitions and signatures are they

612
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,640
recent do you still have a license for a

613
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,710
V we have run into cases where the

614
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:38,700
vendor has had an expired AV contract

615
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,669
and so they hadn't had AV updates for

616
00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:44,640
about a year is there proof of the

617
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,380
ability to detect the future threats on

618
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,059
the same signature so if it's a

619
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:49,380
particular piece of malware once again

620
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,210
our particular piece of ransomware would

621
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,740
your EB catch it the next time that this

622
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:57,510
happens my personal favorite part the

623
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:59,730
horror stories we've all been there the

624
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:01,080
the things that we like to tell our

625
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,720
friends after work the different things

626
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,100
that we were playing the grates in our

627
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,870
mind they're very frustrating at the

628
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:07,860
point in time where you're working

629
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,179
through them but afterwards they usually

630
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,190
give you a good laugh so to start this

631
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,860
off medical service vendor that we used

632
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,440
to of some capacity is breached by

633
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,299
ransomware now it's not the vendor that

634
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:19,919
reaches out to us to tell us that piece

635
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,890
of information it is actually received

636
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:25,559
by us through different ocean platforms

637
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:26,460
open-source threat intelligence

638
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,500
platforms so we work through the data

639
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,890
that we get we reach out to the vendor

640
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:34,020
through our privacy and legal team we

641
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,960
say it we've read we've received an

642
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,240
inclination that you have been breached

643
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,580
by ransomware so they say no it didn't

644
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:44,460
happen like but what we heard from a few

645
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,669
different sources that did happen public

646
00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:49,860
sources public sources yes did it happen

647
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,600
now didn't happen

648
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,580
couple days go by we started to see

649
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,710
headlines on it it's has a pretty good a

650
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:57,179
bit of know of media attention they

651
00:23:57,179 --> 00:23:59,600
still haven't issued any press release

652
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,250
at that point in time they they start to

653
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,360
fess up they start to tell their clients

654
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,610
yes this happened it's all completely

655
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,049
under control don't worry about it

656
00:24:07,049 --> 00:24:09,150
a few more days go by we find out that

657
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,530
it's not under control at all it is

658
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:12,060
actually spread through their entire

659
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:16,160
network it is completely painful and

660
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,660
once we finally reach a point where

661
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,340
they're willing to be completely open

662
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,930
and honest they have nothing left to

663
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:24,530
hide we do find that they had

664
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,880
incorrectly addressed the situation from

665
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,260
the starting point so they claimed that

666
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:31,050
the attack had taken place over SMB was

667
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:33,780
actually slow brute-force RDP so I got

668
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,330
the infection vector wrong also they

669
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:37,160
claimed that this was a

670
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,080
never-before-seen version of criminal

671
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,150
ransomware when in reality it was just

672
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:46,680
commoditize Sam Sam second-year hospital

673
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,270
chain is breached by ransomware this is

674
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:51,420
a hospital chain that we at Primark work

675
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:55,580
with to a pretty decent capacity and

676
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:59,700
they report it to us we ask them okay

677
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,010
what are we dealing with all they say is

678
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:07,260
ransomware oh how did it happen to what

679
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,840
capacity that it spread oh we can't tell

680
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,340
you that

681
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:14,600
well can we get any IO seized at all no

682
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,670
can we have any information can we have

683
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:20,490
anything no we can't share anything we

684
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:22,230
also expect that you are restore that

685
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,120
site to site VPN connectivity that you

686
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,150
had removed at the start but sir we

687
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,310
can't do that if you still have an

688
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:32,250
active breach on your network regardless

689
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:36,290
of the vector through which the spreads

690
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:38,700
well you're gonna have to we're not

691
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,020
gonna provide you any information that

692
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:43,410
was pretty much the extent of that we

693
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:45,570
had a trusted third party that required

694
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:48,120
forensic analysis they had a compromise

695
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,430
and so we reached out to them and asked

696
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:52,140
them for the very things that we told

697
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,450
you in our compromised checklist they

698
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:55,890
reached back out to us and said we don't

699
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:57,840
have a security team we don't know how

700
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,640
to handle this we need your help and try

701
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,980
to figure this out so we said sure we'll

702
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,780
take a stab at it we'd be happy to help

703
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:06,270
you out and so we asked them to send

704
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:09,510
logs they were unable to do that they

705
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,490
said how about we just send you guys the

706
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:13,470
machines can you guys maybe do the

707
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:15,630
forensics on it and this is a offshore

708
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:17,820
vendor right so we reached back out to

709
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,800
them and say okay yep go ahead and send

710
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,830
it to us you know

711
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,539
make sure that goes through customs make

712
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,010
sure that you have it signed for and

713
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:26,320
everything they agreed to mail us two of

714
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,539
the machines that were infected one of

715
00:26:28,539 --> 00:26:31,120
them was lost in the mail they did not

716
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,789
buy insurance and even the machine that

717
00:26:33,789 --> 00:26:36,580
came to us stateside did not require a

718
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,230
signature so it could have very well

719
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:41,080
just been intercepted the mail or lost

720
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:45,130
or given up to anybody else we had a

721
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:47,380
call center services vendor that was

722
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:50,409
breached so when they had it we actually

723
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:53,559
found out about it kind of at phase

724
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:56,409
three they told us about a week after

725
00:26:56,409 --> 00:26:59,139
they were actually initially infected so

726
00:26:59,139 --> 00:27:01,899
at that point we looked at it and said

727
00:27:01,899 --> 00:27:04,120
well usually this is kind of phase three

728
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,269
of an infection so when did you guys

729
00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:08,470
actually get infected and they said oh

730
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:10,990
it happened on Saturday but just that's

731
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:13,510
what happened and we said no that's when

732
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:15,909
you got hit with the ransomware piece

733
00:27:15,909 --> 00:27:18,730
when did you actually get infected oh no

734
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:20,470
it was Saturday that's definitely that

735
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:23,049
and okay well do you guys have a

736
00:27:23,049 --> 00:27:24,159
security team that's gonna take a look

737
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,380
at it no but we have IT staff okay so

738
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,880
you have your IT staff take a look at it

739
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,130
so what are you guys doing to prevent

740
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:34,179
this from happening again

741
00:27:34,179 --> 00:27:36,519
oh well we already started reimaging the

742
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:40,000
devices okay well did you do any backups

743
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,830
did you take a look at you know the

744
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,570
forensic evidence oh no no we just wiped

745
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:45,100
and reloaded it we just figured we just

746
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,510
try to get back to business as soon as

747
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,049
possible

748
00:27:47,049 --> 00:27:49,870
and so through our threat intelligence

749
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:53,080
we had determined that they got hit with

750
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,330
a piece of ransomware that was part of

751
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:57,399
stage three or phase three of the

752
00:27:57,399 --> 00:27:59,320
initial attack so the initial attack

753
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,149
actually happened probably about six

754
00:28:01,149 --> 00:28:04,389
days prior started at stage one moved on

755
00:28:04,389 --> 00:28:06,070
to stage two which was a dropper and

756
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,990
then stage three is where they actually

757
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:11,110
got infected it's anybody in the crowd

758
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:12,399
have a horror story they want to share I

759
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,570
be happy to bring my mic down if

760
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:16,990
anybody's feeling confident come on I

761
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:21,460
know we all have one no takers all right

762
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,909
we'll move on

763
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,370
okay so I guess we actually wrapped up a

764
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:31,750
little bit on the early side unless

765
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,520
anybody does want to indulge us with any

766
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,950
of their particular horror stories sure

767
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:38,350
and we figured we'd also leave time up

768
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:43,450
for Q&A yeah there we go so Mike please

769
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:45,900
sure

770
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,190
the best part with these is that these

771
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:58,150
horror stories help us be better so so

772
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:00,070
the horror stories I recall it's been a

773
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:03,760
long long time I do again is first

774
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:08,860
outside a certain or institution was

775
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:11,800
popped and an outside source told us

776
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:15,630
that the institution had been popped and

777
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:18,640
it took and and this was a nation-state

778
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,340
actor that had done this and where's the

779
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,370
speakers that I don't get feedback okay

780
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:26,050
nation state actor had gotten inside we

781
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:29,260
think and contacted a certain

782
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,300
three-letter organization the FBI and

783
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,890
the corporation who was going through a

784
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:38,650
merger at the time and it took us about

785
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:41,560
a week to get a non-disclosure agreement

786
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,120
in place with the FBI before that we

787
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,710
could come in and get the FBI to do the

788
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:49,270
investigation and by then you know Big

789
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,710
Ben by then the matter had kind of

790
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:52,360
disappeared and people didn't really

791
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,580
seem to care anymore it said horror

792
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:57,100
enough for you Adam sorta kinda that it

793
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,810
makes sense I was trying to keep it you

794
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:03,070
know not a lot of names sure thank you

795
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:07,470
any other takers last chance

796
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:10,000
sure

797
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,490
okay you were talking about collecting

798
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:16,700
all the evidence after the breach what

799
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:20,510
are you doing in your contracts to make

800
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:22,730
it so the vendor provides this

801
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:24,620
information because I'm sure a lot of

802
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,840
people don't want to share that

803
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,850
information it's confidential and then

804
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:31,610
once you get it how are you protecting

805
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:35,000
that information so that their

806
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,200
information doesn't get disclosed so

807
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,940
I'll I'll speak to this first and I'll

808
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,830
let Connor come in after that sure one

809
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,180
of the things that's happened because of

810
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,680
all of these horror stories is that

811
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,260
we've gone back to our contracting parts

812
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,550
of the organization or procurement area

813
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:51,590
and said that you know when we have

814
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:53,210
these cases this is the minimum that we

815
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:55,130
expect from our vendors ditto for

816
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:57,230
understanding for vulnerabilities so as

817
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,430
we see vulnerabilities within the

818
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:00,440
organization within their particular

819
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,720
organizations we ask them you know how

820
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,250
often can we come back to you to make

821
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:06,110
sure that you're doing this that you are

822
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:08,780
patching on a on a reasonable basis I

823
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,700
think the bigger challenge lies in

824
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,370
medical device security because there

825
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:15,380
are a lot of folks who probably work in

826
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,000
healthcare who understand that the

827
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,980
medical device space is a big challenge

828
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:21,560
right now so what we've had to do in

829
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,090
those cases where it's been a medical

830
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:25,010
device vulnerability is having to go

831
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:26,660
back to those particular vendors and

832
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:29,030
saying you know hey we know that you

833
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,530
know you guys were able to mitigate this

834
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:32,750
particular problem but when this happens

835
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,370
again we want to be able to reach out to

836
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:36,320
you and have competent staff that know

837
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,330
how to handle this problem and that we

838
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:39,620
want to have something actually built

839
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:41,570
into our contract with you so that if

840
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:43,100
you breach this we actually will be able

841
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,660
to you know get you for a breach of

842
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,910
contract there is also the legal strong

843
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:48,920
arm so things at the end of the day it

844
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,330
all comes down to money a company that's

845
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:52,340
been breached they're likely spending a

846
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,860
whole lot of money trying to get their

847
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:57,230
systems in pre breach state at that

848
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,820
point in time it's very convenient for

849
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:01,430
our legal team to mention that we pay

850
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:03,140
you X amount of dollars if you're not

851
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,970
willing to work with us on this then I

852
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:06,230
don't think we can provide your business

853
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:07,970
in the future so that's another option

854
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:11,140
as well that answer your question

855
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:19,139
Oh

856
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:30,070
yeah so I'll speak to it and I'll let

857
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:32,169
you chime in here too and I think Ken

858
00:32:32,169 --> 00:32:33,610
also had something right after this but

859
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:37,690
the question from Lisa was around yes

860
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:39,909
that's what I was going to do was around

861
00:32:39,909 --> 00:32:41,350
what do we do with the information that

862
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:43,150
the third party provides to us how do we

863
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:45,090
keep that safe and how do we keep that

864
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:48,220
kept under wraps so I mean at this point

865
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,169
when we receive the incident we actually

866
00:32:50,169 --> 00:32:51,370
have an incident management platform

867
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:53,770
that we keep our information in and so

868
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:55,090
we added as part of that case and we

869
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:56,620
also add it to the after-action report

870
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:59,409
that is only accessible by members of

871
00:32:59,409 --> 00:33:01,510
the incident response team and of our

872
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:03,549
c-cert there's no one else who has

873
00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:05,350
access to that management platform to

874
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:08,409
review that but when we do have items

875
00:33:08,409 --> 00:33:10,480
that we can share we do have meetings

876
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,309
that will schedule with the various

877
00:33:12,309 --> 00:33:14,020
stakeholders to have those conversations

878
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:16,030
to talk about here's where we have you

879
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:17,289
know this the information we received

880
00:33:17,289 --> 00:33:19,450
from the vendor in cases where it's

881
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:20,950
something like logs we'll ask them to

882
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:24,159
send it encrypted we have you know 6 to

883
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:25,960
handle our encrypted mail as well as

884
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,840
opportunities to do so by a SFTP and a

885
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,730
delivery mechanisms to get that

886
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:33,280
information you add to that corner I

887
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:42,419
think you did a great job good and so

888
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:45,669
well so I actually had a question about

889
00:33:45,669 --> 00:33:49,860
one of the horror stories of yours the

890
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,480
hospital chain so you kind of trailed

891
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,980
off there at the end of the story but it

892
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:57,190
sounded like that discussion about

893
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:59,289
restoring the site site VPN may have

894
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:02,440
climbed the ladder a few steps before

895
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,870
you came to some agreement on a yay or

896
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:07,299
nay for that we're just curious what

897
00:34:07,299 --> 00:34:10,030
sort of preparation your management

898
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:13,000
chain had and sort of how that debate

899
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,359
went and how how much traction you guys

900
00:34:16,359 --> 00:34:18,969
had with leadership and how that finally

901
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:22,570
fell out I would say that it was a

902
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:25,449
losing battle from start to finish we

903
00:34:25,449 --> 00:34:27,339
did have all the necessary parties on

904
00:34:27,339 --> 00:34:29,139
the line and what it came down to at the

905
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:30,550
end of the day is this is causing an

906
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:32,440
impact of patient care people can't come

907
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,270
to our offices and get radiology IT

908
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,800
services you need to do this right now

909
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,440
and you

910
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,119
have to put your best foot forward and

911
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:39,260
believe that we've done the work that we

912
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:42,409
say we've done so it was not a very open

913
00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:44,690
and communicative process much further

914
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:46,699
down the road we did finally get all of

915
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:49,510
the information that we were looking for

916
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:52,668
also I I think I believe that the person

917
00:34:52,668 --> 00:34:54,679
who was refusing to give us information

918
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:56,239
is no longer with that organization so

919
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:59,530
oh I didn't know that happen all right

920
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:01,250
get it taken care of

921
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:03,520
sure

922
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:13,260
I work on the network team for a

923
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,630
third-party vendor and in the incident

924
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:18,030
that we have it like an oopsie Daisy and

925
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:20,370
we have to provide these things we have

926
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:22,410
many customers data commingled in our

927
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:26,700
logs how do you manage it so that you

928
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,000
can extract it out so you're not

929
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,200
providing another breach whenever you

930
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,710
provide those logs to a specific

931
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:37,560
customer I would say that you guys

932
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,090
probably have a challenge on your hands

933
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:42,000
when you have commingled data I would

934
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,280
say that in those instances do you have

935
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,230
any of the customer data that you have

936
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:48,420
within your organization segregated at

937
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:53,000
all in any capacity it's all commingled

938
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:57,280
[Music]

939
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:01,310
so that I would say is a hard problem

940
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:03,810
what I would suggest is in those

941
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:06,570
scenarios if you can the best way to do

942
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:08,790
it is to you know be surgical about it

943
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:11,160
and I think that the the hardest part is

944
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,540
one of the slides that I mention earlier

945
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,730
out don't lie to your customers right so

946
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:16,410
if you are the third party that now has

947
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:18,390
to deal with this breach that you now

948
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:19,590
have to inform your customers about

949
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,090
don't tell them that you'll have the

950
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:22,620
logs within a couple of days in fact I

951
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,790
think they would appreciate the fact

952
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:25,650
that you say hey you know we're working

953
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:27,360
on it let's have date you know we'll

954
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,220
give you a daily status update I think

955
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,990
just being more communicative than not

956
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:32,070
at all

957
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,930
we'll probably ass wash a lot of fears

958
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:35,970
that organizations have I mean I'm more

959
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:37,410
willing to work with somebody who says

960
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:39,660
hey I'm working on this and I'll give

961
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,130
you an update every couple of days just

962
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:42,330
to let you know how it's going

963
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:44,460
versus I'll let you know whenever we're

964
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,980
done or hey I'll have this in 24 hours

965
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,690
and they just not respond and not return

966
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:54,830
that information anybody else

967
00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:59,160
all right thank you very much everyone

968
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:03,230
I don't remember the only limit is

969
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:06,230
yourself
