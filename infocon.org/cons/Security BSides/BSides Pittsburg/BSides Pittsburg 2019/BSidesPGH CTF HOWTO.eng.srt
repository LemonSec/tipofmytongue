1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,970
hi everybody I'm Dan I helped run the

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:07,919
CTF at besides Pittsburgh we've had a

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,019
lot of people asking us if they're new

4
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:12,630
to capture the flag events whether this

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,519
would be a good one to attend and if so

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:16,650
whether we had some advice or

7
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,060
suggestions for them to kind of get

8
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,800
started and we'd like to think that

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,990
besides Pittsburgh and all the b-sides

10
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,210
events are really good opportunities for

11
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,570
people that are new to try things out so

12
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,369
definitely we decided to make this video

13
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:32,130
and hopefully give you some pointers

14
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,350
that will at least get you started on

15
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,100
the east side on the city of it so first

16
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,450
of all what is it capture the flag or

17
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,120
CTF event so there are a variety of

18
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,430
different kinds some of them just have a

19
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,350
series of challenges that you have to do

20
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,000
in order or out of order they're worth

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,640
different number of points and they're

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,370
kind of stand-alone challenges related

23
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,370
to hacking or InfoSec or whatever some

24
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:57,660
of them were attacked and depending

25
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,520
where you have to both attack and defend

26
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,989
your own computers while you're doing so

27
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:03,270
some of them have some teams that are

28
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,619
attackers and some teams that are

29
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:07,619
defenders ours is an offense only event

30
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:10,290
meaning that all the players are trying

31
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,900
to hack into this network that we've

32
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,330
built and there really are no defenders

33
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,520
other than the fact that you know we're

34
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,470
running the machines you can reboot them

35
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,770
if something goes wrong etc so anyway

36
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,759
that's what he CTF is vaguely okay so

37
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:28,799
what is our CTF at besides what we've

38
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,180
always tried to do is we've tried to

39
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,930
emulate a smaller realistic environment

40
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:35,460
so we try to make it similar to what you

41
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,930
might do when you're on an actual

42
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,810
penetration test so for example the

43
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,460
network is fairly open although it's

44
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,100
small so you might have to dig through

45
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,810
different computers and look for

46
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,000
interesting files etc just like you

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,280
broke into somebody's desktop at a

48
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,350
corporation and you don't know what

49
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,930
might or might not be interesting we

50
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,070
always make sure that there's multiple

51
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,350
paths to at least some of the goals so

52
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,270
there's not one rigidly defined way did

53
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,399
you have to move through it if you get

54
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,509
stuck on one thing that is usually

55
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:04,890
something else that you can try to work

56
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,489
on and we are definitely not trying to

57
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:10,400
emulate red team engagements or

58
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,150
certainly not an

59
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:16,200
to attack on corporation so there's no

60
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,690
need to be stealthy or avoid tension or

61
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,430
attribution or anything like that

62
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,840
there's no blue team that's chasing you

63
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,310
down etc it's just kind of a

64
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,810
free-for-all we ask that you don't

65
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,390
protect the other players but besides

66
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,310
that everything that's in scope is it

67
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:36,000
scoped so we also probably throw some

68
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,920
challenges in that are just for fun we

69
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,450
need you to throw a few false leads in

70
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,579
there but hopefully not anything that

71
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:42,989
will take you down the wrong path for

72
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:45,900
too long some Easter eggs just because

73
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,349
we get bored one two so the goal is to

74
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:51,599
find the most flags whoever finds the

75
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,549
most flags in a lot of time wins if

76
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:54,900
there's a tie then whoever does it

77
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,230
quickest wins but there is a linear

78
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,000
progression so getting one flag will

79
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,799
generally lead you to some information

80
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:03,480
that will get you to the next flag

81
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,370
sometimes you will accomplish a goal you

82
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:07,799
will not get a flag but that will be

83
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:11,970
necessary to get to the next flag Flags

84
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,150
get harder as you go so even people that

85
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,470
haven't done it before should be able to

86
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,510
get the first few flags relatively

87
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,340
easily and hopefully have some fun doing

88
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,380
that people who have done this a lot are

89
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,239
going to get to some of the you know

90
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,889
harder flights and hopefully not ever

91
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:28,500
get them I don't think we've ever had I

92
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,989
mean buddy get all the flags and a dozen

93
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:34,590
or so see tips that I've run maybe that

94
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,680
means it's too hard I don't know the

95
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,629
flags do have a standard format so you

96
00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:41,699
can recognize what they look like we

97
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:42,930
haven't decided exactly what that will

98
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,319
be this here but one thing that we do is

99
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,470
we if you skate them a lot so instead of

100
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,209
just being ascii text that says playing

101
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:53,340
one two three it could be x or encoded

102
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,919
it could be in binary it could be p 64

103
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:58,349
etc so look for things that stick out

104
00:03:58,349 --> 00:04:03,090
like that so what do you need you need a

105
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,590
laptop with power supply because you're

106
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,290
gonna be sitting there for six hours we

107
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,989
recommend to Wi-Fi nix one two attached

108
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:14,370
to the capture live environment itself

109
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,399
and then another one to detect the

110
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,839
internet so you can hook things up and

111
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,450
download

112
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:23,410
exploits etc we highly recommend that

113
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:27,190
you use Kali Linux and that you update

114
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:30,070
it shortly before you come to the CTF

115
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,810
don't try to do it there because then it

116
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,790
works too slow but make sure you do it

117
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,380
because we do try to keep things up to

118
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,020
date so there may be exploits that if

119
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,280
you have an update your Kali in six

120
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,780
months you're not going to have them in

121
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,530
there and sure if you want to break the

122
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,330
exploit yourself feel free

123
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:52,900
it sounds fun but uh you may not win um

124
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,030
that doesn't mean that of course every

125
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,130
vulnerability or exploit that we put in

126
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,810
there is going to be like from last

127
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,880
month because sometimes we like to throw

128
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,410
in real old-school stuff just because

129
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,120
there's lots of really old stuff still

130
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,210
running out on the Internet

131
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:09,670
ok so now we get to the interesting part

132
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,680
what should I do like maybe you've never

133
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,170
actually been in a penetration test so

134
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,550
I'm gonna give you a couple hints um

135
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:18,520
this is really general I know you can't

136
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,380
generalize a penetration test or how you

137
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:24,330
do this kind of thing but we're going to

138
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:27,760
give you some pointers and I guess this

139
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,650
is my opinion of how a lot of

140
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:32,170
penetration tests go so right or wrong

141
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:35,110
that's what the CTF will be so when you

142
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,310
start out you're going to look for

143
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,690
websites or other services that are

144
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:40,200
available to quote-unquote the Internet

145
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,530
usually what you're going to see other

146
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,240
than web is you know I think you know

147
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,240
conferencing or but we're twice man

148
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,650
German things like that

149
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,110
there's corporations these things don't

150
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,880
have a lot of stuff that's accessible

151
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,310
from the internet we've kind of gotten

152
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,290
past that point so some of the things

153
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:02,110
you're gonna look for you can use tools

154
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,300
like nmap and eyewitness to try to

155
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,490
enumerate websites to try to numerate

156
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,810
any other services that might be

157
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,300
listening and what you're going to do

158
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,770
then is you're going to examine those

159
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:15,070
sites and services carefully and I mean

160
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,890
really carefully especially in this

161
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:20,050
contest so make sure you look at the

162
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,820
banners what versions things are running

163
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,870
look at the HTML look at the JavaScript

164
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:28,420
look for DNS entries or hidden URLs or

165
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,790
anything like that

166
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,860
there's often things that you will find

167
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,620
that are not supposed to be on the

168
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,970
internet and we're trying to emulate

169
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:40,250
that some years we include fishing of

170
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,200
challenges in CTF some years we don't so

171
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,780
you'll find out June 28th whether we did

172
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,780
this year you'll probably find a

173
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,870
culmination of like vulnerabilities in

174
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:52,890
the sense of something that would get a

175
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:55,530
CBE and just configurations and just

176
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:59,160
playing or somebody screwed up all which

177
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,750
may allow you to get a foothold on the

178
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,610
network eventually you're going to get

179
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:04,410
some kind of remote code execution or

180
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:09,710
more of the machines in this network and

181
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,730
we do make sure that there's at least

182
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,590
two initial entry points there may be

183
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:16,620
more that you can access right off the

184
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,190
bat so make sure that you're not like

185
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,380
stuck not getting any flags just because

186
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:28,260
you didn't get one of the things and so

187
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,450
some of the some of the tools you're

188
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,860
probably going to use after you scan the

189
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,300
network and stuff a little bit or web

190
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,700
testing tools like burp sequel injection

191
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:39,390
tools and math and Metasploit scanners

192
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,850
and things like Metasploit and cobalt

193
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:46,530
strike and you're going to you know

194
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,450
hopefully eventually be able to get some

195
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:50,340
kind of remote code execution on one of

196
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,630
those machines are more than one of

197
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,340
those machines using those tools and

198
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,740
then you want to examine the machines

199
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,160
that you've got access to so what does

200
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,570
it have that's going to get you farther

201
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:02,190
if it's a web server does it talk to a

202
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,110
database server on the back end are the

203
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,880
credentials for the database server

204
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,280
store got is there a user that

205
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,870
frequently connects to or from that

206
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:12,540
machine or are there tokens or hashes or

207
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,400
SSH keys or anything that could get you

208
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,950
farther and help you pivot it and move

209
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,140
around the network is there any

210
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,460
interesting network traffic or

211
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,470
connections like shares or anything like

212
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:25,530
that you probably don't want to repeat

213
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,870
the scanning steps that you did before

214
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,970
you might find IP addresses reports or

215
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,200
something that weren't visible from the

216
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,289
outside or now

217
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:35,019
the inside and you want to think about

218
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:37,000
how you can use your new foothold to

219
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,219
attack other systems and use different

220
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:40,990
kinds of pivoting techniques to move

221
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:43,479
around the network you might find more

222
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:45,699
vulnerabilities lots of times when

223
00:08:45,699 --> 00:08:47,649
you're actually penetration testing once

224
00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:49,360
you've got one vulnerability and got a

225
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,110
foothold or without a vulnerability what

226
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,819
you'll find is not so much vulnerability

227
00:08:54,819 --> 00:08:56,589
just is just an ability to move around

228
00:08:56,589 --> 00:08:58,720
the network using different post

229
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,889
exploitation techniques so at that point

230
00:09:02,889 --> 00:09:03,970
what you want to do is you want to try

231
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:05,380
to move laterally and escalate your

232
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,569
privileges within the network and use

233
00:09:07,569 --> 00:09:09,009
things like power sploit meterpreter

234
00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:13,930
empire etc to to help you move around in

235
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:17,560
the network that you're in now and then

236
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,079
finally if you run across any unusual

237
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:21,940
would skew bowls or binaries or source

238
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,459
code or anything you might want to check

239
00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:26,050
those out pretty carefully I'm just

240
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:26,610
saying

241
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,420
so hopefully this will help you

242
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:31,089
hopefully it'll give you some places to

243
00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:32,410
start and give you an idea of what we're

244
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,149
thinking about it and I hope you have

245
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:39,029
fun I hope to see you on June 8th bye
