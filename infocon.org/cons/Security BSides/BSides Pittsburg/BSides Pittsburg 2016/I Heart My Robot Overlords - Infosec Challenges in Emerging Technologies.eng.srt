1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,700
at this point I'd like to introduce you

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:07,379
blind ins the owner merely researcher at

3
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:09,679
CMU in the certain Coordination Center

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,240
he's gonna kick us off here with our

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:21,330
first talk today so gangsta so all my

6
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,880
slides are coming up which one day is

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,490
great to be ending up here again a lot

8
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,250
of a lot of familiar faces out there you

9
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,308
don't know me I'm Dan klinedinst I I

10
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:34,469
hope to start besides Pittsburgh back in

11
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:37,079
2011 with Joe and some other people and

12
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,820
I don't know about drill but I don't

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,410
think that we thought at that point that

14
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,809
at some point there the 6th annual be

15
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,160
tied to Pittsburgh with almost 200

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,950
people so that's pretty awesome the

17
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,270
current organizers are doing a great job

18
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,399
and so get one more round of applause

19
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:58,559
for all the organizers Brian I'm still

20
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,989
getting from us like something hey all

21
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:05,339
right so the top is called I fart my

22
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:07,560
robot overlords postech challenges is

23
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,659
emerging technologies this is probably

24
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:11,400
one of these less technical talks today

25
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,860
but probably given and getting ready

26
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,740
start of the day I'm going to keep

27
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,790
walking moving microphone I apologized

28
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,200
so this is based on a record that we did

29
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,759
it surf and put out a couple months ago

30
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,400
called the emerging knology domains mrs.

31
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,860
survey and it is by myself and several

32
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,880
other people

33
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,539
that sir and one who used to work there

34
00:01:32,539 --> 00:01:34,530
such want to make sure I acknowledged

35
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,439
their work with probably more than my

36
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,869
own copyright information okay so I'm

37
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:44,759
not going to go through this but I'm a

38
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,229
vulnerability researcher at the cert

39
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:48,090
Coordination Center which is the subset

40
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,380
of the certain division at Carnegie

41
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,270
Mellon University we're basically the

42
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,439
group that has been putting out the

43
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,060
vulnerability notes for the last 30

44
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,340
years so when you get those your email

45
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,069
that's from us like I said I helped

46
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:00,960
start besides Pittsburgh and I used to

47
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,829
work at Lawrence Berkeley National

48
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:07,500
Laboratory and bunch of other things so

49
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,869
our agenda today we're going to cover

50
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:11,220
three main topics we're going to talk

51
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,840
about common challenges emerging

52
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,459
technology industries so these are

53
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:15,540
things that cut across a lot of

54
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,790
different industries as we see it we're

55
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,290
going to then go into some specific

56
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,000
technologies we reviewed in this report

57
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,880
and talk about specific risks and novell

58
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,900
risks that I thought were interesting

59
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,030
and then I'm going to do kind of a case

60
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,769
study and talk about connected and

61
00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:30,120
autonomous cars because that's where

62
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,079
most of my research has been done

63
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:35,280
recently I'm go see if I can hold this

64
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,180
oops I won't like feedback all right so

65
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,440
emerging technologies risk survey is

66
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,489
something that we were asked to do by

67
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:46,019
Homeland Security a couple of years ago

68
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:48,540
and they basically asked us to look at

69
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,590
things that were coming down the pipe

70
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,639
that we might have to be worried about

71
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:53,670
in the future we as a country and as the

72
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,700
infosec industry and we went out and

73
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,470
tried to identify technologies that were

74
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,680
going to be hitting a like really in the

75
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,389
market in the next five to ten years we

76
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:05,970
didn't want to go too far out so we

77
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,889
identified these we've been updating it

78
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:11,130
each year since then and really what we

79
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,350
did is we identified common and

80
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,970
widespread challenges that were new to

81
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,200
the security industry that are going to

82
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,079
be coming coming up and then we also

83
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,730
identified some technology specific

84
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,489
risks and then what we did with that is

85
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:26,069
we decided to recommend either we do

86
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:27,599
technical research in it so my car

87
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,849
research is a result of this and

88
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:31,859
basically identified automobiles as one

89
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:33,630
of the highest impact things to society

90
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,310
so that's why we decide we should focus

91
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,979
our research on that area or if we

92
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:39,630
should just do some outreach so like the

93
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,819
medical industry we don't have the

94
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:44,069
you know people to do everything so the

95
00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:45,060
medical industry we're not really doing

96
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,650
hands-on technical researchers doing

97
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,680
outreach or just keep situationally

98
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,730
aware of what's going on in those

99
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,900
industries because they might not be

100
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:57,030
quite to market saturation yet our

101
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,769
technologies we chose are based on a

102
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:00,689
Gartner hype cycle which comes out each

103
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:02,250
year most of the things I'm going to be

104
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,719
talking about today kind of fall to the

105
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:05,939
right-hand side of that peak there's a

106
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:08,010
few from the left with the things to the

107
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:09,480
right of the peak are generally things

108
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,010
that are starting to really become

109
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:13,829
widespread in the market things to the

110
00:04:13,829 --> 00:04:15,000
left are still a little bit farther out

111
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,769
there all right so some of the common

112
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:21,870
things we've seen across these emerging

113
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,520
domains one is the fact that you can

114
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,680
have genetic effects you can make things

115
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,389
happen in the real world so I'm sure

116
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:28,860
everybody in here has probably seen the

117
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,620
Jeep video and know that Chris and

118
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,910
charlie ray were to take control of the

119
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,470
Jeep and drive it down over the

120
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,849
embankment as well as control it on the

121
00:04:35,849 --> 00:04:37,650
road and things like that there's a

122
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:38,669
whole bunch of industries where this is

123
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:40,560
going to be a concern that you can now

124
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,810
not only hack into a computer and access

125
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,610
the information or steal the information

126
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,139
or change it or take the computer down

127
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:48,300
now you can actually access things cause

128
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,370
things to happen in the real world which

129
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,110
obviously has safety implications as

130
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:55,169
well this didn't cause anybody to get

131
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,759
hurt but you can easily imagine that

132
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:59,099
hacks on cars on medical devices etc can

133
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:03,199
certainly cause human harm or even death

134
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,659
here's another commonality that i like

135
00:05:06,659 --> 00:05:09,210
to call semantic attacks there's a

136
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,949
situation recently where Microsoft

137
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:12,389
decided to put up this artificial

138
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:14,220
intelligence chatbot on Twitter and

139
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,280
within 24 hours the AI had read other

140
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,570
Twitter feeds in what comments were made

141
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,669
to it and stuff and it had started

142
00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:22,650
spewing all kinds of pro Hitler racist

143
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,330
completely inappropriate things and

144
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,449
Microsoft had to pull it off of twitter

145
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:29,009
so this was an attack certainly by

146
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:31,650
people that were trying to get the AI to

147
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,150
do something that Microsoft had not

148
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,979
intended but it wasn't an attack in the

149
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:37,080
sense of trying to you know exploit a

150
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,759
buffer overflow or a network protocol

151
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,500
vulnerability or anything like that it

152
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,570
was sending it valid information but

153
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,070
causing a machine-learning behind it to

154
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,900
do the wrong thing we're going to talk a

155
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,949
little bit more about that when we get

156
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:49,370
to the cars

157
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,380
so business models are also different

158
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,210
and that actually does concern us and

159
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,620
the reason why i use this specific

160
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,540
little graph from an income statement

161
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,880
here is the biggest difference i see

162
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,530
between traditional software

163
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,030
vulnerabilities in these emerging

164
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,860
domains where computing and networking

165
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,170
is built into products is that there are

166
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,940
now physical products and your business

167
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,680
model has to account for that so

168
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,420
software has a really large margins

169
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,920
because once you've created a copy of

170
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,320
software you can resell it you know

171
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,270
unlimited number of times for virtually

172
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:22,540
no additional unit costs hardware or

173
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,490
physical goods are not like that so if

174
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,410
you are making home routers or something

175
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:28,600
it costs money to produce each one of

176
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,220
those so that's going to change your

177
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,900
economics change how much you can expect

178
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,550
to spend to support those over the

179
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:35,980
lifetime of the device and patching for

180
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,540
security problems becomes more of an

181
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,610
issue because now you can't just push

182
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,070
software patches over the air

183
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,150
necessarily you might have to go out and

184
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,800
find these devices in warehouses or

185
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,690
store shelves or somebody's house where

186
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:47,919
they just stuck it and forgot about it

187
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,160
for three years and so people I don't

188
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,419
think companies are taking that into

189
00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:54,280
effect right now when they do their

190
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,960
business models and say hey how much is

191
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,340
this going to cost me they're not

192
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,270
including the fact that they're gonna

193
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,979
have to pay for maintenance now with

194
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:01,270
fixing vulnerabilities or even just

195
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,650
general software maintenance down the

196
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:09,520
road being a maintenance so I was going

197
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,630
to use a different picture for this but

198
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,770
then I saw this on Twitter just the

199
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,900
other day so somebody just took this in

200
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,160
an airplane they're still running

201
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:22,330
windows 98 18 years ago and you know

202
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:24,550
this pictures like this come up a lot of

203
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:25,990
it conferences like this and we all kind

204
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:28,450
of laugh that's ridiculous but I bet a

205
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,880
lot of us in here have devices that are

206
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,440
attached to computers which we really

207
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,970
don't want to ever upgrade because we're

208
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,470
worried that that device is not going to

209
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,360
continue working industrial control

210
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,610
systems are famous for this I used to

211
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,530
work at Berkeley National Lab and there

212
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:42,760
was a lot of computers that controlled

213
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,110
scientific equipment that they never

214
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,840
ever wanted to upgrade or change because

215
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,710
when you have a particle accelerator

216
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,630
that costs a million dollars a day to

217
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,610
run you don't want to risk changing it

218
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,669
because windows botched another upgrade

219
00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:55,930
so this is a problem I think and it's

220
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,550
going to be more of a problem as

221
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:00,099
software get baked into more things and

222
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:02,530
has to be updated and patched and

223
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:05,669
maintained in general

224
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,190
the automation in general I would say

225
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,870
the automations of security is a good

226
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,340
thing and we had a good conversation

227
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:18,080
about this yesterday and it's great when

228
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,760
you do can do over-the-air updates to

229
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,320
automatically update security patches

230
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,380
and things like that on your devices but

231
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,030
there's like an incident recently with

232
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:28,130
Microsoft with Windows 10 where they

233
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,020
forced an update on to all of the

234
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,539
computers and for some subset of Windows

235
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:34,070
10 computers it cause the computer to go

236
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,809
in this endless loop of just crashing

237
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:38,240
and rebooting so that's the kind of

238
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,219
thing where years ago if people did

239
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:41,690
manual updates somebody would have done

240
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:42,830
that they would have realized it was a

241
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,960
problem would it become public Microsoft

242
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,850
would have warned people not to use that

243
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,770
patch and probably a lot less people

244
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,360
were would have been affected and now

245
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,120
that Microsoft pushes automatic patches

246
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,830
automation is good but there's also

247
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:57,320
risks involved in it and Google had a

248
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,760
similar thing that didn't actually crash

249
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,710
anything but when they act the stage

250
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:03,410
fright bug the patch originally didn't

251
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,780
fix all the security issues that they

252
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,520
had to go through and redo a patch and

253
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,040
redeploy that to the 950 million Android

254
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,260
devices assuming that the Android

255
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,730
devices get patches to begin with which

256
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:21,590
is if you proposition at best so then in

257
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,050
our security industry specifically

258
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:25,670
there's some processes that we need to

259
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:28,190
think about as we're scaling up and

260
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,990
putting computing and Internet in

261
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:32,930
billions of devices now one of those is

262
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,940
the CVE the note individual numbers for

263
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,550
vulnerabilities SI ve already cannot

264
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,420
keep up with a number of vulnerabilities

265
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:41,090
that there are in software so i think

266
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,110
there's no way it's gonna be able to

267
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:44,000
keep up with all these devices that may

268
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,520
now have vulnerabilities in them and

269
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,510
they recognize that and they're not

270
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,830
trying for a hundred percent coverage

271
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:51,320
and there's some new alternatives to c

272
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,970
ve that are coming out to try to address

273
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,380
this and automate it so it'll scale

274
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,240
better the problem is now we don't have

275
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,370
a single identifier for vulnerabilities

276
00:09:58,370 --> 00:09:59,720
we may have three different

277
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,280
vulnerabilities and different sets of

278
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,570
vulnerabilities being covered by the

279
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:05,930
different identifiers patch management

280
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:07,610
so this kind of goes back to the windows

281
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:10,580
98 thing but no it's already hard to

282
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,620
patch all of your Windows servers patch

283
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,440
all of your desktops laptops

284
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,510
third-party software now you're gonna

285
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,470
have to worry about patching your

286
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,330
elevators and your HVAC systems and your

287
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:20,980
cars and your fleet and everything else

288
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,980
it becomes a either a massive nightmare

289
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,570
or a massive market or opportunity

290
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:28,570
depending on how you look at it and then

291
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:31,030
CBS s and CIA kind of go together so the

292
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,100
CBS has scores that score the impact of

293
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,260
vulnerabilities are currently mostly

294
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,210
based on the CIA triad so

295
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,740
confidentiality integrity and

296
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,930
availability but that doesn't take into

297
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,670
other take into account other things

298
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,860
like safety so for example if you've got

299
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,960
a denial of service attack on a car

300
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,850
makes a big difference to me whether

301
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,950
that denial of service stops the car as

302
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,330
soon as I turn it on and I can never go

303
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:54,820
anywhere versus it stops the brakes and

304
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,050
steering from working when it's already

305
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:58,150
going 70 miles an hour but to me those

306
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,080
are two very different vulnerabilities

307
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,630
as far as the impact of them that would

308
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:02,950
it but but they would probably the same

309
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:06,130
cvss score those are a bunch of things

310
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:08,040
that we're going to have to worry about

311
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,020
in the industry specifically whether our

312
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,640
processes can scale and handle all these

313
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,170
billions of new devices I'm going to go

314
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:19,150
into some of the specific interesting

315
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,440
challenges i saw in specific

316
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,120
technologies this is the list of

317
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,520
near-term domains that we identified I'm

318
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,750
not going to talk about all of them just

319
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,560
the ones that I think are more

320
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,450
interesting if I'm doing pretty good on

321
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:34,270
time so it's good i did this talk

322
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,740
yesterday and it took an hour and i only

323
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,240
have 45 minutes today so I'm trying to

324
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,860
talk fast ok so the connected home also

325
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,720
if a few people in here that saw my talk

326
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,950
yesterday I think this video actually

327
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:50,460
work this time I can find

328
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,950
almost

329
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:03,070
we plan a bad video game so I think

330
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:04,360
there's three things to be concerned

331
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,790
about in connected homes one is a

332
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,110
privacy issue so there's already been

333
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:10,330
issues where Samsung has warned

334
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,800
customers that if they walk in front of

335
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,270
their smart TV and they're talking the

336
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:15,430
TV might record their voice and send it

337
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:16,900
up to Samsung when they don't realize it

338
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:20,560
there's been smart Barbie dolls where

339
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,060
they were recording the kids voices and

340
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,410
sending them off in an insecure manner

341
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,140
up to cloud services at Mattel or

342
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,930
whatever and so privacy issues are one

343
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:31,150
of the concerns second concern to me is

344
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,100
that now all of these devices that are

345
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,480
seeing up here that you're putting in

346
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,250
your house become entry points into your

347
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:40,360
home network so even if your doorbell is

348
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,160
not that important to you if it gets

349
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,530
compromised the person is now inside

350
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:45,970
your network and can use that to jump

351
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,710
and pivot to your computer your laptop

352
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:51,850
your phone whatever and then the third

353
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:53,350
thing is the fact that these devices

354
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,820
themselves can be attacked and whatever

355
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,170
they're supposed to do can be overridden

356
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:59,080
so think about garage door openers or

357
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,700
door locks or something like that these

358
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,080
being put on Wi-Fi now an

359
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,990
internet-enabled and so if a hacker can

360
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,670
get to that then they can just tell the

361
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,960
door to open and then walk in and take

362
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,090
your stuff now I think people are

363
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,350
thinking about this too much like my

364
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,700
parents just bought a security system

365
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,170
and they can check their security system

366
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,610
and turn it on and off and stuff over

367
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:17,980
the internet and like it just seems like

368
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,710
a really bad idea to me you can do it

369
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:23,910
then I pretty sure I can do it

370
00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:33,320
the augmented reality is another one

371
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,670
that we looked at this is interesting

372
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,440
it's instead of virtual reality where

373
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,420
everything you see is fake you wear some

374
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,459
kind of golf smart goggles or glasses

375
00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:42,680
like this is the microsoft hololens and

376
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,779
you see the real world but then you see

377
00:13:44,779 --> 00:13:47,570
virtual information superimposed over

378
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,339
the real world so in this example this

379
00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:51,260
guy's supposedly designing this

380
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,880
motorcycle and he's seeing what the

381
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,260
motorcycle will look like with his new

382
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,000
pieces even though he hasn't actually

383
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,310
created them yet I think augmented

384
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:00,050
reality in the beginning is probably

385
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:01,190
going to be used for things like this

386
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,839
for engineering and architecture and

387
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:05,149
medical things but people are already

388
00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:06,800
talking about hey in 10 years we might

389
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,089
all be walking around with smart glasses

390
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:10,100
on hopefully they look a little better

391
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,610
than the google apps but so if you're

392
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:14,779
walking around with glasses and your

393
00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:16,579
glasses or show you the real world but

394
00:14:16,579 --> 00:14:19,399
with digital data superimposed what's to

395
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:21,230
say that the real world information you

396
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,070
think you're seeing through those

397
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,079
glasses is still real if they can

398
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,389
potentially be a hacked if I'm going to

399
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:28,040
step out in the street I look for cars I

400
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,529
want to be really sure there's no cars

401
00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:32,660
coming I'm not sure I trust a device

402
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,670
considering the history of security

403
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:37,130
devices that make that assumption and

404
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:39,649
step in front of the or not step in

405
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:46,730
front of a car hopefully so changing

406
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:48,529
gears a little bit cryptocurrency is

407
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:49,910
another thing that came up in our report

408
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:52,190
so as of a few days ago the market

409
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,769
capitalization of Bitcoin all Bitcoin in

410
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:56,149
the world was almost nine billion

411
00:14:56,149 --> 00:14:59,420
dollars that's a fair chunk of money and

412
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,230
I think the interesting thing about

413
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,839
bitcoin is that you can attack the

414
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:05,000
servers that store bitcoins and wallets

415
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,339
and keys and things like that just like

416
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:08,720
you would attack any traditional servers

417
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,339
but you can also attack the protocols

418
00:15:10,339 --> 00:15:12,199
and algorithms themselves that make up

419
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:14,690
bitcoin bitcoin all it is is data and

420
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,100
protocols that are agreed upon by

421
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,220
millions of people and so vulnerability

422
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,870
and that actually changes the value of

423
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:23,750
the currency so that's kind of a novel

424
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,630
attack path and you could argue that our

425
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,339
current financial system is mostly just

426
00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:29,839
data and algorithms it's not backed by

427
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,130
gold or anything anymore and there are

428
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,560
people who can quote unquote hack it

429
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,260
already you know they're just financial

430
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,510
people rather than computer people but I

431
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,069
think the concern is that current

432
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:41,390
regulators and people that

433
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,340
watch this kind of activity are really

434
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,500
good at doing accounting and finance and

435
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,270
things like that they're probably not as

436
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:50,720
good yet at doing analysis of algorithms

437
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,850
and protocols and that kind of thing and

438
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:55,340
to be honest bitcoin is I find it very

439
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:59,890
confusing myself and not in computers

440
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,690
machine learning so this is probably

441
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:07,310
going to affect almost everybody no

442
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:11,000
matter what industry you're in but II I

443
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,110
want to talk about how it's going to

444
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,880
affect our industry specifically because

445
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,500
I think that in the next five to ten

446
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,390
years this whole pattern where there's

447
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,070
vulnerabilities and they get announced

448
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,450
and patched and the patches get rolled

449
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:22,790
out and eventually deployed and all that

450
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,680
it's going to become too fast for humans

451
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,810
to be able to keep up with it so we

452
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,820
already see situations where people are

453
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,410
trying to automate patches to apply to

454
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:32,240
security issues as soon as they're found

455
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,490
well the service is still running and I

456
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:36,320
can foresee that at some point that

457
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,270
whole cycle of doing the patches and

458
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:39,800
finding the vulnerabilities everything

459
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,930
is going to become automated but this

460
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,760
year at Def Con there will be the cyber

461
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,430
Grand Challenge first the first Grand

462
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:48,800
Challenges it has a bunch of teams

463
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,360
trying to design these systems that can

464
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,770
attack each other so they're competing

465
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:53,300
in the CTF without human intervention

466
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,490
and then those automated systems are

467
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,110
going to compete against the best human

468
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,380
teams in the world or type of DEFCON CTF

469
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:02,480
so no we're not quite there yet but

470
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,099
we're definitely on our way to the point

471
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:07,339
where we as humans cannot do the current

472
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:08,630
jobs that we're doing in security

473
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:09,890
because it'll be just too fast we'll

474
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,329
have to rely on AI and machine learning

475
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:13,640
to do it but I think what our jobs will

476
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,930
be will be more to define what those

477
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:16,910
rules are that the AIS and the machine

478
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,650
learning is using figure out what it

479
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,390
should do which of course opens up a new

480
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:22,959
attack path

481
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,940
medical devices have already gotten some

482
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,250
press with the insulin pump hacks and

483
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,410
stuff like this I found this the other

484
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:34,490
day on the internet this is called the

485
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:37,070
i-limb it's a bionic either hand or just

486
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,290
fingers and yes it can be controlled

487
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:41,750
from an app on your phone you can preset

488
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,670
different hand positions and I'm just

489
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,260
not sure that I'm ready to have an art

490
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,670
well I'd rather not have an artificial

491
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,020
limb at all but if I had when I don't

492
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,070
think that I would want to have one

493
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,540
that's controlled by an app on a

494
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:58,850
smartphone especially Android it really

495
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,140
this is kind of a superset of a lot of

496
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,220
these other things what we're talking

497
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,240
about is the fact that we're now going

498
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,730
to have all these machines that have

499
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,930
autonomy and artificial intelligence and

500
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:07,550
the ability to affect the real world and

501
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,620
also have internet connections or just

502
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,390
local radio connections apps whatever

503
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:15,290
and so do we trust these machines do we

504
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:17,750
have confidence in them for safety

505
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,070
engineering but also for security

506
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,960
engineering that they can't be under

507
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,690
mind or used nefariously and I think

508
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:25,040
there's gonna be a strong motivation for

509
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,660
people to attack these because a lot of

510
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,890
these machines are going to be taking

511
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:30,170
humans jobs away and humans often don't

512
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:32,930
like that but there's a big motivation

513
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:34,700
to attack you know autonomous cars

514
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,410
because I'll take away taxi driver jobs

515
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:38,870
and their jobs or whatever and

516
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:41,780
all these robots already actually exists

517
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,270
except for the Terminator that one

518
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:51,740
doesn't exist yet roans is another area

519
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,180
that we're actually researching right

520
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:55,250
now which is really interesting you've

521
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,750
got a couple worries here one is the

522
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,030
fact that being in downtown Pittsburgh

523
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,380
and seeing that there's hundreds of

524
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,320
drones flying around over your head

525
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,790
delivering lunch or packages for Amazon

526
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,860
or whatever that's already kind of scary

527
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,540
enough when you worry about whether you

528
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,980
can attack either the drone itself or

529
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,630
the systems that are scheduling flight

530
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,790
paths and all that kind of thing but

531
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:14,720
then there's also has added motivation

532
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,280
of trying to steal whatever the drones

533
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,960
are trying to deliver so if you can

534
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,510
think that like terminally ill patients

535
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,950
might think it's great to be able to

536
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,510
have a drone deliver them morphine or

537
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,800
something as soon as they need it from

538
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,630
the local pharmacy not have to wait for

539
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:28,940
a driver or something but there's a

540
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,770
really strong motivation for an attacker

541
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,380
to try to over you know take control

542
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,640
that drone and land the morphine

543
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,080
somewhere else so they can get it and

544
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,269
the intended recipient doesn't

545
00:19:38,269 --> 00:19:40,249
so there's a couple you know different

546
00:19:40,249 --> 00:19:48,619
motivations and we normally see all

547
00:19:48,619 --> 00:19:50,119
right I'm actually talking too fast when

548
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:52,729
won't slow down so connected on

549
00:19:52,729 --> 00:19:53,959
autonomous vehicles is something that

550
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,609
I've been working on a lot the last year

551
00:19:55,609 --> 00:19:58,580
or so and kind of a big thing around

552
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,959
Pittsburgh with it were advanced

553
00:19:59,959 --> 00:20:01,909
technology center and everything we have

554
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,109
anybody that's willing to admit that

555
00:20:03,109 --> 00:20:08,359
they work at rue HEC in here today oh so

556
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:09,349
either they're not here they're not

557
00:20:09,349 --> 00:20:13,549
willing to admit it oh this is kind of a

558
00:20:13,549 --> 00:20:14,899
combination of three different domains

559
00:20:14,899 --> 00:20:16,279
that we recognize and I figured I'd put

560
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:17,690
them together and go to do with a little

561
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,190
bit more technical depth since this is

562
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:21,139
what I've been doing specific recently

563
00:20:21,139 --> 00:20:23,539
so this is networks telematics this

564
00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:25,729
means the in-vehicle infotainment system

565
00:20:25,729 --> 00:20:26,869
basically a little thing in the center

566
00:20:26,869 --> 00:20:30,320
console of your car which now has maps

567
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,419
navigation and also can say like what

568
00:20:32,419 --> 00:20:33,829
miles per gallon you're getting and all

569
00:20:33,829 --> 00:20:35,119
kinds of information about your car

570
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:37,190
obviously still has entertainment radio

571
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:39,469
and all that and then autonomous

572
00:20:39,469 --> 00:20:41,239
vehicles or vehicles that can self drive

573
00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:42,799
to some degree weather that's just the

574
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,899
current Tesla can take control or go

575
00:20:44,899 --> 00:20:47,179
park itself and you know going a whole

576
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:48,529
way up to fully autonomous cars that

577
00:20:48,529 --> 00:20:50,209
don't need a human driver at all and

578
00:20:50,209 --> 00:20:52,639
then intelligent transportation systems

579
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:55,009
are coming up and this is sometimes

580
00:20:55,009 --> 00:20:58,039
called be 2x and what that is is cars

581
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:00,379
and road infrastructure communicating

582
00:21:00,379 --> 00:21:01,969
with each other through short-range

583
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,459
radio messages the stop sign can

584
00:21:04,459 --> 00:21:06,679
actually send a message to your car they

585
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:08,119
hey there's a stop sign coming up your

586
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:09,589
car can be saying hey I'm at this

587
00:21:09,589 --> 00:21:11,119
location I'm going this fast and

588
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:12,649
broadcast that to all the other cars

589
00:21:12,649 --> 00:21:15,619
around with the idea that you can your

590
00:21:15,619 --> 00:21:18,499
car make decisions based on those it'll

591
00:21:18,499 --> 00:21:19,669
be too fast for you to make a decision

592
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:21,259
but your car might be able to adjust

593
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:28,489
itself the network telematics is the

594
00:21:28,489 --> 00:21:29,599
area that I've been looking at the most

595
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:31,669
recently we just put out a report a

596
00:21:31,669 --> 00:21:33,739
couple months ago that where we looked

597
00:21:33,739 --> 00:21:35,209
at devices that plug into your car

598
00:21:35,209 --> 00:21:38,239
they're called obd two devices and this

599
00:21:38,239 --> 00:21:39,739
on the right hand side as an example of

600
00:21:39,739 --> 00:21:41,809
one of these and we examined a whole

601
00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:43,909
bunch of these because the concern is

602
00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:46,609
that they plug into your car and this

603
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:48,349
therefore give you a network access to

604
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:49,260
the network that's in the

605
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,120
are and they also have a radio on them

606
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,400
which allows access from smartphone over

607
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,320
bluetooth or Wi-Fi or over a cellular

608
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,140
connection and so we examined a bunch of

609
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,610
these and found that pretty much all of

610
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,190
them had some security problems there

611
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,900
were ones that we've got off of Amazon

612
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,340
for ten dollars and they really were

613
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,830
just like a serial connection from

614
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:10,430
bluetooth to the inside of your car and

615
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,450
I'll talk in a little bit more depth

616
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:17,490
about those in a minute then

617
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:18,840
self-driving cars I think everybody kind

618
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,610
of knows what those are this is the

619
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:22,260
self-driving car that CMU build a couple

620
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,000
years ago right down the street it's

621
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,060
actually part of the national robotics

622
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,740
engineering center whose name I always

623
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,110
flub but the interesting thing about

624
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,490
this self-driving car is it's not

625
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:33,870
obvious from the outside that it can

626
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:35,760
drive itself all of the cameras and

627
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,490
radar and lidar and stuff for built in

628
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,690
although I've been in it and if you open

629
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:41,400
the back the whole trunk is basically

630
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,560
taken up by racks of 1u servers running

631
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,710
Linux so not quite as practical as a

632
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:49,890
real car yet but we know that the uber

633
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:50,880
cars are already driving around

634
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,020
Pittsburgh so this is definitely

635
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:55,860
something it's coming up quickly then I

636
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,930
mentioned v2x and this is kind of a

637
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:59,610
visual depiction from department

638
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:00,690
transportation of how this might work

639
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:03,180
but involves both vehicle to vehicle and

640
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,820
vehicle to infrastructure services which

641
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:10,110
are called V to V and V 2 I um and you

642
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,910
can kind of see from the picture that

643
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:14,130
what it's showing is that both the

644
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:15,360
vehicles themselves any infrastructure

645
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,800
along the roads can broadcast

646
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,410
information so this ambulance could be

647
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:20,850
broadcasting hey I'm an ambulance you

648
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:22,140
should get out of the way and your car

649
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,700
car automatically change lanes to clear

650
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,610
the way Construction Equipment could be

651
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:28,470
broadcasting there's a lane closed up

652
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:30,540
ahead you should move to the left the

653
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,100
car could broadcast messages back behind

654
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,490
it saying that they're slowing down

655
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:37,080
suddenly for some reason so all the

656
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,670
other cars behind it would know hey

657
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:39,870
there's something going on because a car

658
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:41,240
up there slowed down all of a sudden

659
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,580
that's kind of the idea behind this

660
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:49,440
glorious vision we're gonna dive into

661
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,700
just a little bit of technical stuff I

662
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,200
promise not to much hexadecimal first

663
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,720
thing in the morning but um just to

664
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,100
explain a little bit about how cars work

665
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,370
on the insides they basically have a

666
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:00,900
whole bunch of things called electronic

667
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,350
control

668
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:05,039
units ECU's communicate over various

669
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,419
types of networking but one of the most

670
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:07,830
common networks they use internally is

671
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,330
called the can bus or controller area

672
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:11,820
network and the thing about cars is that

673
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:14,520
there's no central server or brain

674
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,230
inside the car that knows what all these

675
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,850
different ECU's do each one of them

676
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:19,559
operates on its own and all it knows is

677
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:22,110
I receive certain inputs I should do

678
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:24,600
certain things so there's nothing that's

679
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,090
looking for patterns of activity that

680
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,190
might be suspicious or something that

681
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:32,039
the car wouldn't normally do but

682
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:34,110
somebody asked me yesterday like so if a

683
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:37,020
car says that it's going 90,000 miles an

684
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,820
hour is the car to me smart enough to

685
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:41,100
realize that its odometer cannot

686
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,440
probably also be at 70,000 miles after

687
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,380
our doing that and the answer is no but

688
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,630
there's no nothing that correlates those

689
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:50,940
different pieces of data that realizes

690
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:56,400
that's a problem so the can bus

691
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,690
specifically is a problem basically

692
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:59,789
there is no security built into the car

693
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,380
because they never expected the internal

694
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,760
network of a car to be attached to the

695
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:06,390
internet which it now is so just briefly

696
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:08,549
to explain why this is a problem this

697
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:10,440
the canvas is a simple serial protocol

698
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,210
most of these devices that plug into

699
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,130
your car or they're already built into

700
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:15,720
the car like your infotainment system

701
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,210
they just use this simple 80 command set

702
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:19,650
same thing that we used in our haste

703
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:22,380
modems back in like the 90s to send

704
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,799
serial commands to the can bus and the

705
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:29,490
format of a can bus message is extremely

706
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:31,140
simple there's a can identifier which

707
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,179
says which ECU that message is intended

708
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:36,240
for and then there's a length and the

709
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,740
data that up to eight bytes of data that

710
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,890
can go in it you'll note that there's no

711
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:44,190
source identifier so that's a problem if

712
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:45,780
my speedometer gets a message and it's

713
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,340
addressed to it and it says the current

714
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:50,010
wheel speed is 70 miles an hour it has

715
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:52,049
no idea whether that actually came from

716
00:25:52,049 --> 00:25:54,120
a wheel speed sensor on the wheel or if

717
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,559
it came from the canvas because I just

718
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:57,270
injected it there's no idea where it

719
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:58,830
came from so it's just going to act on

720
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,900
it without that kind of authentication

721
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:04,020
and this will be totally unacceptable in

722
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,220
a network protocol that we put in our

723
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,990
enterprise IT networks but this is how

724
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:08,820
powers and lots of other machinery have

725
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,909
operated for decades then down at the

726
00:26:11,909 --> 00:26:13,260
bottom here is just a couple of examples

727
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,630
of can messages so you can

728
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:16,130
see what they look like you can see

729
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:18,800
they've got an identifier and then ages

730
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,970
the length and then they've got a few

731
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:22,790
bites explaining what they're doing one

732
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,020
is just requesting the list of all

733
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,640
diagnostic trouble codes from the car

734
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,160
and another is I've been working on a

735
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,440
Chevy Volt that we have up at CMU which

736
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:36,740
is currently inoperable oops hey and but

737
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,090
that you can request the current amps of

738
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,350
the battery meaning the big three

739
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,460
hundred volt battery the runs it

740
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,590
consists electric car well those are

741
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:44,030
just some examples to show you that how

742
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:47,270
simple the protocol is couple other

743
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:49,250
examples so i sent these commands over

744
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,110
one of the devices i compromised i sent

745
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,580
these commands into the car and got back

746
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:55,100
likely for an engine RPM and the outside

747
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:58,010
ambient air temperature and so all i had

748
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:00,200
to do is send messages to specific can

749
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,110
ids and once you know the messages that

750
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,940
are applied with whatever they print

751
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,230
information is so that's just reading

752
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:08,930
information not terrible although it's

753
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:10,010
kind of bad that i can do it over the

754
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:14,330
internet even better is this one that i

755
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:17,000
found for the volt this is a can ID for

756
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,880
the door lock control system and so you

757
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,010
can send these messages that you see on

758
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:23,390
the side and you can cause the front

759
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:25,010
door and walk or all the doors to lock

760
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:27,020
for all the doors to unlock you can set

761
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,760
off the panic button or disable the

762
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,930
panic button if it's going off and

763
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:32,180
you're trying to steal the car so at

764
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,380
this point I was like sweet i got to the

765
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:36,350
point where i can steal my own car um i

766
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,940
haven't actually got in the car to start

767
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,400
yet by doing this because i have to

768
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:43,610
spoof the little remote key thing the

769
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:45,650
key fob so i can get it to start an

770
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:46,970
accessory mood but all that does is turn

771
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:49,580
on the radio and the no air conditioning

772
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,260
and things so not quite to the point

773
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,760
where i can totally steal the car just

774
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,410
using this compromise device but i'm

775
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:57,080
getting there by next year i should have

776
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:02,120
actually moved the car though changing

777
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,080
gears a little we're going to talk about

778
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,840
the pki system that's used for this

779
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,280
vehicle to vehicle so you can imagine

780
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,710
that it's a concern if you've got all

781
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,600
these cars and all these infrastructure

782
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,860
elements on the road that are sending

783
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,060
messages to each other and taking

784
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,770
actions based on those messages if you

785
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:17,930
can spoof those messages you can cause

786
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,370
accidents you can cause traffic jams

787
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:23,510
whatever and so this is a public picture

788
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,370
of what the

789
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,200
transportation is recommending for their

790
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,120
test of this kind of system that they're

791
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,559
conducting in Detroit and a couple other

792
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:32,559
cities and if you have built this

793
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,510
incredibly complicated looking pki

794
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,910
system which is in fact incredibly

795
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:39,460
complicated and this is gonna be the

796
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:42,040
largest pki system ever built 250

797
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,290
million cars with over a trillion public

798
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:48,970
key certificates in it and they've done

799
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:50,380
a pretty good job of this and I've

800
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,090
actually skimmed through what I could

801
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:54,100
understand of the like 100 page document

802
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,960
on it it seems like it's pretty good

803
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,010
they've got like some real crypto

804
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:59,500
experts and stuff it's got some good

805
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,330
things built in like so it's got a Miss

806
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:03,040
behavior Authority built right into it

807
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,700
so your car is driving along it will get

808
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,380
a certificate revocation lists on a

809
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,480
regular basis so you know that if for

810
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,160
some reason my car is misbehaving and

811
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,690
I'm no longer allowed to send messages

812
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:16,450
to other cars that certificate will be

813
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,679
revoked I'll get it on the next

814
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,210
certificate other cars will get the

815
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:21,309
certificate revocation list and they'll

816
00:29:21,309 --> 00:29:24,670
no longer trust my messages it also has

817
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:25,870
a couple things for privacy because

818
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:27,460
people were department transportation

819
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:30,370
were they figured that the average

820
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:31,630
citizen would be concerned about the

821
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:32,800
privacy of having all this information

822
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,420
about their car being broadcast

823
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,370
everybody all the time but there's a

824
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:39,070
location obscure proxy which does

825
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,600
exactly what it says it blocks the

826
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,670
location of the car from being able to

827
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:43,780
be figured out based on the network

828
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,300
traffic so you can't essentially do a

829
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:49,300
traceroute to somebody's car and then

830
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:52,630
there's the up here the pseudonym CA so

831
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:55,000
it turns out and I didn't know this that

832
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,190
you can create public key certificates

833
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:59,290
and public key private key pairs where

834
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:01,780
many different private keys can sign for

835
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,850
the same public key and so that enables

836
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:06,460
all these different cars to sign using

837
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,590
our own individual key but to the system

838
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,450
it just looks like one public key that

839
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:11,980
may represent any of thousands of cars

840
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:15,090
so that helps obfuscate which car is

841
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:16,870
broadcasting which signals where

842
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:18,309
otherwise you can imagine would be

843
00:30:18,309 --> 00:30:20,020
really easy to trace a car as it moves

844
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:22,210
between these different points in a city

845
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:24,550
just based on the messages received by

846
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:27,790
stop plates or something so this is

847
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,110
actually really good I think they did a

848
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,970
good job designing this and they took a

849
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:33,190
lot of things into consideration but

850
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:35,140
it's a really massive complex system and

851
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:35,779
do we know of any

852
00:30:35,779 --> 00:30:37,279
massive complex systems that don't have

853
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:40,279
vulnerabilities in them we know of any

854
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:41,929
simple systems a ton of vulnerabilities

855
00:30:41,929 --> 00:30:43,700
in them probably not so it's a little

856
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,249
bit concerning but they're really

857
00:30:46,249 --> 00:30:51,440
working on it so it's a good sign this

858
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,940
is just an example of how those messages

859
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:55,219
like how far they'll go so this is a

860
00:30:55,219 --> 00:30:56,659
google maps with little red circle that

861
00:30:56,659 --> 00:30:58,519
shows about the range and a little black

862
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:00,950
dot and there was a car right there so

863
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:02,570
you're talking about range of like 200

864
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:05,179
meters so it's not you know that attack

865
00:31:05,179 --> 00:31:06,979
surface of the radios themselves the

866
00:31:06,979 --> 00:31:09,409
range isn't very far the concern is more

867
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,629
attacking the certificate authority

868
00:31:11,629 --> 00:31:13,039
system itself because that's as

869
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:14,359
attackers that's usually what we do

870
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:16,399
right we don't attack the end nodes we

871
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,799
try to attack the systems that run all

872
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:21,289
the credentials if we can much rather

873
00:31:21,289 --> 00:31:23,570
have domain admin and have just a user's

874
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:28,909
workstation now a couple good things

875
00:31:28,909 --> 00:31:30,229
about this I know everything I've been

876
00:31:30,229 --> 00:31:31,429
saying this morning has been bad and

877
00:31:31,429 --> 00:31:32,989
made you have bad dreams tonight but

878
00:31:32,989 --> 00:31:34,909
there are a couple good things this

879
00:31:34,909 --> 00:31:36,710
proposed system is only pushing out what

880
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:38,719
are called basic safety messages they're

881
00:31:38,719 --> 00:31:39,919
just real short things like hey I'm

882
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,179
slowing down all of a sudden it's

883
00:31:41,179 --> 00:31:43,940
nothing real complicated and these

884
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,889
messages are only one way so there's no

885
00:31:45,889 --> 00:31:47,690
kind of request response sort of thing

886
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:49,909
just I'm broadcasting my information

887
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:51,379
about my car you can use it or not as

888
00:31:51,379 --> 00:31:53,389
you see fit you don't wanna trust me

889
00:31:53,389 --> 00:31:56,779
that's fine it requires internet

890
00:31:56,779 --> 00:31:59,690
connectivity which is with a good and a

891
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:02,450
bad thing the good thing is that you can

892
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:04,009
push down the certificate revocation

893
00:32:04,009 --> 00:32:07,279
lists in real time so you know as soon

894
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,289
as a car or a stop sign or whatever

895
00:32:09,289 --> 00:32:10,820
starts misbehaving and sending spoof

896
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:13,159
traffic or bad messages I can get us

897
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:16,070
thinking revoking their certificate the

898
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,210
bad thing is that requires internet

899
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:18,619
connectivity obviously to get that

900
00:32:18,619 --> 00:32:20,899
pushed to you there's currently no like

901
00:32:20,899 --> 00:32:22,219
peer-to-peer way to do it over the

902
00:32:22,219 --> 00:32:25,159
radios so as soon as you lose internet

903
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:26,599
connectivity in your car like if you're

904
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:27,859
driving through a spot where there's no

905
00:32:27,859 --> 00:32:30,169
cellphone receptive atif your car stops

906
00:32:30,169 --> 00:32:32,899
actually trusting any certificates until

907
00:32:32,899 --> 00:32:34,249
it can reconnect to the internet and get

908
00:32:34,249 --> 00:32:37,999
the new crl so i can see that as a

909
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:39,529
possible like a denial of service or

910
00:32:39,529 --> 00:32:42,080
something problem there and then you

911
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,909
currently you must be enrolled at a

912
00:32:43,909 --> 00:32:45,289
dealer this is obviously not being

913
00:32:45,289 --> 00:32:46,440
installed in real cars quite

914
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,570
yet but their plan at the moment is that

915
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:49,980
you would have to take your car to the

916
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,600
dealer and there's a fairly long process

917
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,820
of authorizing your car and saying yes

918
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:56,039
this really belongs to this person and

919
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:57,210
all that kind of thing and downloading

920
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:59,429
all the certificates so it's a pretty

921
00:32:59,429 --> 00:33:01,289
high overhead they're looking to

922
00:33:01,289 --> 00:33:02,610
possibly change that so it's a little

923
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:07,080
easier all right a couple of cool things

924
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:10,200
to wrap up here so this is a light

925
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,340
Arsene like radar except uses lasers and

926
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:15,450
this is one of the main things that

927
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:17,220
autonomous cars used to figure out their

928
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,570
environment this is actually Market

929
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:21,090
Street in San Francisco as seen by a

930
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:24,419
lidar system and these actually create a

931
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:25,919
pretty accurate picture like there's a

932
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:27,120
lot of details you can see the rails

933
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,740
going up the street for the street cars

934
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,220
and stuff like that the problem is it's

935
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,200
not that difficult to attack these

936
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,639
systems directly rather than attacking

937
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:37,559
the network components so if you just

938
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:39,929
take a regular laser and shine it at the

939
00:33:39,929 --> 00:33:42,470
light our system on the car you see that

940
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:45,690
it's clay nothing now granted most of

941
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,370
the cars have multiple lidar systems on

942
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:49,379
them so just because you can blind one

943
00:33:49,379 --> 00:33:51,059
assume you can hit the camera with laser

944
00:33:51,059 --> 00:33:52,559
doesn't mean you're going to blind all

945
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,450
of them but if you have an autonomous

946
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:55,860
car driving through the middle of

947
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,090
downtown San Francisco like I'm

948
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:58,950
concerned of even one with my cameras is

949
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:01,259
not working correctly and I know Google

950
00:34:01,259 --> 00:34:02,519
and uber and stuff are working on this

951
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:05,580
but the fact is there are are already

952
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,740
known attacks on these autonomous

953
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:12,239
systems so getting back to the semantic

954
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,679
attacks that I mentioned earlier on

955
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:17,849
that's kind of interesting so pop quiz

956
00:34:17,849 --> 00:34:21,569
what's this a picture of a car yes a red

957
00:34:21,569 --> 00:34:23,369
car it's really obvious that this is a

958
00:34:23,369 --> 00:34:25,949
red car because bright red and it's very

959
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:27,389
car shaped and it stands out from the

960
00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:30,540
background really good so a visual

961
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,760
recognition system that like camera that

962
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,010
actually uses visible light waves just

963
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:36,719
like we would see would be able to

964
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,219
figure out that's a car based on machine

965
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:39,270
learning it looks like all the other

966
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:42,739
cars that's ever seen this car does not

967
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:45,329
so obviously camouflage is it intended

968
00:34:45,329 --> 00:34:47,760
to trick our visual systems and make us

969
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,069
not be able to recognize things so this

970
00:34:50,069 --> 00:34:51,569
vehicle has all these blotches of

971
00:34:51,569 --> 00:34:53,399
weirdly shaped color and the colors kind

972
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:54,659
of blend into the background on the

973
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,819
foreground so our current visual

974
00:34:56,819 --> 00:34:58,250
recognition systems will have a bear

975
00:34:58,250 --> 00:34:59,600
hard time figuring out that that was a

976
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,150
car if this ancient world war two truck

977
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,560
was driving from his building towards an

978
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,420
autonomous vehicle the vehicle might not

979
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,640
even realize it was there so that's a

980
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,140
problem if I can't see other cars but

981
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,400
it's also potentially a problem with

982
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,990
pedestrians so it's gonna be really hard

983
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:16,970
for current visual recognition systems

984
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:18,470
on cameras to figure out that those are

985
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:20,780
pedestrians again because their outlines

986
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:22,310
are broken up their weird colors they

987
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:24,760
blend into the background etc and so

988
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,590
this is again a semantic attack if you

989
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:29,240
dressed like this and stood in front of

990
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,730
an autonomous car which I'm not sure why

991
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:33,100
you would want to attack in that way but

992
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:36,230
assuming you did what you're doing is

993
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:37,940
you're providing valid information

994
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,710
you're not doing a buffer overflow or

995
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:40,880
anything like that the camera is

996
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,880
accurately recording the colors it sees

997
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,500
the shapes that sees etc it's just that

998
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,340
when it feeds it into its

999
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:49,610
machine-learning inside the car you're

1000
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:51,200
going to override its algorithms for

1001
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,110
what it thinks a pedestrian looks like I

1002
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,340
think it's interesting that you can you

1003
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:57,230
know potentially trick these things not

1004
00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:00,380
using traditional software laws that

1005
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:03,350
we're used to using admittedly if you

1006
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:04,610
did this when you'd be a suicidal

1007
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:05,780
attacker and you wouldn't hack anything

1008
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,940
else but I'm sure there's some way to

1009
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:10,960
abuse that and these are not just

1010
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,220
hypothetical so I just met last week a

1011
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:15,230
guy named dr. Jonathan petit from

1012
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:17,930
security innovation who actually did

1013
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:19,310
some of these tests including the light

1014
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,350
our thing and the breaking up cars with

1015
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:23,390
blocks of color thing to trick cameras

1016
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:24,680
and has found that these are actual

1017
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,450
problems in current systems that they're

1018
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:29,150
using me as a bunch of other experiments

1019
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:31,010
that he wants to do on other things but

1020
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:32,780
so the point is that there are active

1021
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,580
attacks against these systems easy even

1022
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:35,930
as these systems haven't been deployed

1023
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:40,540
yet yes

1024
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:55,339
so that's a good point and one second

1025
00:36:55,339 --> 00:36:57,950
notice okay yeah let me talk about that

1026
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:59,390
for a second so the question if you

1027
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:01,250
couldn't hear him was why are we not

1028
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:02,930
hearing about attackers hacking cars and

1029
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:04,220
driving people off the street and things

1030
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:07,220
like that for 1 i'm not sure there's a

1031
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,660
motivation necessarily to just drive

1032
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,820
cars off the street for a lot of hackers

1033
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,079
certainly there's a subset where there

1034
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,119
is that motivation but i think the

1035
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:15,500
biggest thing is the fact that it's

1036
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,880
actually really difficult to reverse

1037
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,430
engineer car currently if i want to

1038
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:20,829
write an exploit for Windows or Linux

1039
00:37:20,829 --> 00:37:23,390
pretty easy I know have a good idea once

1040
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:24,560
I've got the vulnerability I've got an

1041
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,810
idea of how to do the shellcode to

1042
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:30,260
create an exploit on cars how to affect

1043
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:32,000
steering wheels and brakes and things

1044
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,950
like that it varies definitely for a

1045
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:35,510
manufacturer of a manufacturer and even

1046
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:37,970
between models and even model years in

1047
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:40,730
order to write a an exploit that works

1048
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:42,050
it's only going to work on very small

1049
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:44,270
subset of cars so unless you have a

1050
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:47,540
known person that has a car that you and

1051
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,859
you know the exact year and everything

1052
00:37:48,859 --> 00:37:50,329
and you really don't like that person

1053
00:37:50,329 --> 00:37:52,670
it's it's still hard to do that but I

1054
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:53,839
think what we're going to see is people

1055
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:56,030
are already reverse engineering these

1056
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,589
cars which is why I have some of the can

1057
00:37:57,589 --> 00:37:59,329
IDs and things from the Chevy Volt and

1058
00:37:59,329 --> 00:38:01,069
we're going to see people putting

1059
00:38:01,069 --> 00:38:02,510
together exploit kits and putting them

1060
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:04,640
out on the internet saying eh this is

1061
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,140
all the information for how to control

1062
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:08,329
way deep Cherokee or Chevy bogor

1063
00:38:08,329 --> 00:38:12,460
whatever answer the question

1064
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:17,920
alright so bringing this all together I

1065
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,019
actually made of my own pictures you can

1066
00:38:20,019 --> 00:38:21,069
probably tell it's not as good as the

1067
00:38:21,069 --> 00:38:23,319
other pictures but what we're gonna have

1068
00:38:23,319 --> 00:38:24,789
is we're gonna have this cars driving

1069
00:38:24,789 --> 00:38:26,410
around and going to be talking to the

1070
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:27,910
internet all the time getting it

1071
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:30,069
certificate revocation lifts gonna be

1072
00:38:30,069 --> 00:38:31,390
getting updates to its maps because

1073
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:32,979
self-driving cars are heavily dependent

1074
00:38:32,979 --> 00:38:36,549
on maps much more so even in GPS but it

1075
00:38:36,549 --> 00:38:38,799
is also be get beaten going to be

1076
00:38:38,799 --> 00:38:40,809
getting things from space like satellite

1077
00:38:40,809 --> 00:38:43,239
radio and GPS signals you might think

1078
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:44,949
satellite radio well that's not a big

1079
00:38:44,949 --> 00:38:46,539
deal like so somebody hacks it and they

1080
00:38:46,539 --> 00:38:49,150
force my sirius XM to play a Taylor

1081
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:51,910
Swift all the time you know pretty

1082
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:53,019
annoying but not the worst thing that

1083
00:38:53,019 --> 00:38:54,699
could happen I don't know maybe some of

1084
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:55,660
you think that is the worst thing that

1085
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:58,900
could happen but the problem is that

1086
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,309
satellite radio is used in place of

1087
00:39:00,309 --> 00:39:01,989
cellular especially on like

1088
00:39:01,989 --> 00:39:04,119
long-distance trucks and heavy equipment

1089
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:05,469
construction equipment things like that

1090
00:39:05,469 --> 00:39:07,930
because they in addition to cellular

1091
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:09,069
because they know that they might be in

1092
00:39:09,069 --> 00:39:10,239
a lot of areas where they will be in

1093
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:11,829
areas where there's no cell receptivity

1094
00:39:11,829 --> 00:39:14,680
so it's not just radio going over those

1095
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:19,089
radios not just music it's also this

1096
00:39:19,089 --> 00:39:20,199
other information that might come from

1097
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:21,219
the internet might come from a satellite

1098
00:39:21,219 --> 00:39:23,319
that we've seen owner abilities already

1099
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:25,779
in satellite systems that cert has

1100
00:39:25,779 --> 00:39:28,180
published on so this is definitely being

1101
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:31,359
exploited for real the little blue cone

1102
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:32,440
that's sticking out the front of the car

1103
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,359
that's your automated driver assist

1104
00:39:34,359 --> 00:39:36,039
system so the radar and the light are we

1105
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:37,449
talked about the fact that all of those

1106
00:39:37,449 --> 00:39:41,319
can be spoofed in some way ultrasonic is

1107
00:39:41,319 --> 00:39:43,119
interesting you Orca sonic actually you

1108
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:44,829
can spoof messages without even having

1109
00:39:44,829 --> 00:39:47,650
any original message go out to the car

1110
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:50,769
and then you've got all these things

1111
00:39:50,769 --> 00:39:51,940
that are talking to your car sending

1112
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:54,579
messages that it should trust you know

1113
00:39:54,579 --> 00:39:56,079
the Vita I and the b2b stuff that I was

1114
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:57,729
talking about but the bottom middle

1115
00:39:57,729 --> 00:39:58,869
picture is kind of interesting that's

1116
00:39:58,869 --> 00:40:00,459
trucks doing what's called platooning

1117
00:40:00,459 --> 00:40:02,319
this is something where these big heavy

1118
00:40:02,319 --> 00:40:04,209
trucks take advantage of these messages

1119
00:40:04,209 --> 00:40:06,489
to drive up really close behind one

1120
00:40:06,489 --> 00:40:07,989
another to take advantage of drafting

1121
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:09,969
you get better gas mileage and stuff and

1122
00:40:09,969 --> 00:40:12,459
they can do this because radios in them

1123
00:40:12,459 --> 00:40:14,319
are talking to each other so if the

1124
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:16,089
first one slows down the automatic

1125
00:40:16,089 --> 00:40:17,499
brakes and the other ones behind it can

1126
00:40:17,499 --> 00:40:19,150
also slow them down far faster than a

1127
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:21,609
human could do it which is great as long

1128
00:40:21,609 --> 00:40:25,640
as the system has no security issues

1129
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,950
now somebody brought up well with a cart

1130
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:29,630
or another truck actually try to hack

1131
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,190
the system in order to get a place in

1132
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:33,799
line I don't know with the machine

1133
00:40:33,799 --> 00:40:35,029
learning system decided that's a good

1134
00:40:35,029 --> 00:40:38,059
thing to do so there's potentially

1135
00:40:38,059 --> 00:40:39,260
issues there and then the bottom right I

1136
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:46,279
just had to put it for Orion yeah yeah

1137
00:40:46,279 --> 00:40:49,039
that's mine yeah come on you know where

1138
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:56,299
I work okay yeah no comment all right so

1139
00:40:56,299 --> 00:40:57,980
this is the actual record if you want

1140
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,779
all the details this includes things

1141
00:40:59,779 --> 00:41:02,569
like expected market share and expected

1142
00:41:02,569 --> 00:41:03,920
amount of revenue in the industry and

1143
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,970
stuff so you can go download it from

1144
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:07,730
that URL and I'm going to take questions

1145
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:09,440
until they kick me off the stage someone

1146
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:28,730
back here so 22 inches to that I guess

1147
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:30,589
so on the one hand we've already put out

1148
00:41:30,589 --> 00:41:32,390
some best practices for devices that

1149
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:34,160
plug into your car and I think that

1150
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,319
those are going to get formalized and

1151
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,029
we're working with the SAE on a more

1152
00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:40,160
secure obd2 port which is the port that

1153
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,599
a lot of these plug into in your car and

1154
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,640
then inside the car there are a lot of

1155
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,859
people that are doing research into

1156
00:41:44,859 --> 00:41:47,210
adding things like firewalls network

1157
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:49,369
segmentation doing encryption and

1158
00:41:49,369 --> 00:41:51,859
authentication is in crypto the

1159
00:41:51,859 --> 00:41:53,299
difficulty there is that a lot of these

1160
00:41:53,299 --> 00:41:54,890
ec years are running on an 8-bit or even

1161
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:56,660
four bit processors but they really

1162
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,490
can't do a es encryption and things like

1163
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:01,910
that so there's also an sae standard on

1164
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:04,490
cyber security in cars that is thinking

1165
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:05,930
draft right now and should be coming out

1166
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:07,730
soon so the good thing is that

1167
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:09,529
manufacturers are aware of this and

1168
00:42:09,529 --> 00:42:12,019
we're working with a lot of them to try

1169
00:42:12,019 --> 00:42:14,180
to fix some of these problems but it's

1170
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,289
not there yet and the cars they're

1171
00:42:15,289 --> 00:42:16,880
putting the security fixes in now aren't

1172
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,309
gonna be on the road for five years and

1173
00:42:18,309 --> 00:42:21,230
I've read estimates that by 2020 we're

1174
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:23,200
going to see about like 20 million cars

1175
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,759
self-driving cars fully autonomous on

1176
00:42:25,759 --> 00:42:28,339
the roads in the US so it's a question

1177
00:42:28,339 --> 00:42:30,589
of whether the cars or the security will

1178
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:35,259
get here first Adam

1179
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,640
the question is with the v-tex

1180
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,380
technologies with law enforcement use

1181
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:52,110
that for things I'm sure that are going

1182
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:54,210
to want to that's one of the main

1183
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:56,190
reasons why do t design these location

1184
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:57,780
obscure proxies and the second ama

1185
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:59,490
student couldn't say this word yesterday

1186
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:01,050
either the pseudonym certificate

1187
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:03,630
authority to prevent that information

1188
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:05,040
from being collected whether they'll be

1189
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,440
successful in staving off people that

1190
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,940
want that I don't know but I think

1191
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:11,040
certainly as far as like speed control

1192
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,960
and stuff yes but wouldn't be surprised

1193
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,270
if it's essentially impossible to speed

1194
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:18,810
in 10 years on the flip side they'll

1195
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:19,920
probably raise the speed limits because

1196
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,810
the autonomous systems are adapt a lot

1197
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:25,140
faster kind of dark in here so if you're

1198
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:26,160
in the back and you have your hand out

1199
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:35,310
duck George so that's something that

1200
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:38,240
comes up a lot yeah

1201
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:54,310
I say yes there are known kinetic

1202
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:55,990
attacks against cars which are much

1203
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:57,880
easier to do than me reverse engineering

1204
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:01,450
the unlock codes for the Chevy Volt the

1205
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:03,400
difference one is the fact that you can

1206
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:07,180
probably do it less traceable so brick

1207
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:09,400
thru window causes a pretty big obvious

1208
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,950
thing and the other thing is that you

1209
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:14,410
can potentially do this at scale so even

1210
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:15,970
ones that have only short-range radio

1211
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:18,190
connections like Bluetooth or Wi-Fi or

1212
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:21,040
connecting two phones or ivi systems or

1213
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:21,970
something that are connecting to the

1214
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:24,160
internet you know Chris and Charlie

1215
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,720
found that the vulnerability they found

1216
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,370
in the Jeeps there's like seven hundred

1217
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:30,930
thousand cars on the internet with those

1218
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,850
because Kristen charlie didn't release

1219
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:35,830
the details of how the jeeps control

1220
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:46,020
systems worked yep

1221
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:04,330
right um well you can get software kits

1222
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:07,150
for specific models of cars but it's

1223
00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:11,440
right it's per car yeah yeah you can't

1224
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,210
just buy a bus powder download

1225
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:16,090
metasploit or something like that um so

1226
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:18,160
believe me I hope that I'm wrong about

1227
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,380
this yeah and we find that there are not

1228
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:33,460
security problems yeah I think I do um I

1229
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:35,020
said I've been talking to a lot of

1230
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:36,430
manufacturers and standards

1231
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:37,540
organizations and Department of

1232
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:39,670
Transportation and people really do care

1233
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:41,890
about this largely because of the cheap

1234
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:45,430
hack love it or hate it and so I think

1235
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:46,840
that people are taking this seriously

1236
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:49,300
and we're going to get a handle on it to

1237
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:51,700
the degree that we have a handle on car

1238
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:54,310
security already so it's going to be

1239
00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:55,420
better than what we have now which is

1240
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:58,359
humans driving cars and killing 30,000

1241
00:45:58,359 --> 00:46:01,300
people a year in the u.s. is it are

1242
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,859
there with our be security issues well

1243
00:46:02,859 --> 00:46:04,150
there you can potentially be hacks where

1244
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:07,089
people possibly die probably and I mean

1245
00:46:07,089 --> 00:46:09,280
we kind of know from car security in

1246
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,500
general or car safety in general that it

1247
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:12,910
takes a bunch of people dying before

1248
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:14,680
manufacturers are actually willing to go

1249
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:15,970
to the cost of a recall and fix problems

1250
00:46:15,970 --> 00:46:20,500
a lot of times so that's a concern but

1251
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:21,940
yeah I mean there's a question of what

1252
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:23,859
the impact or risk of this is compared

1253
00:46:23,859 --> 00:46:28,589
to traditional attacks yes

1254
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:50,770
yeah it does similar to SSL uses

1255
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:52,530
nonsense and stuff that are agreed upon

1256
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:54,970
in and it does the same kind of thing

1257
00:46:54,970 --> 00:46:56,500
where uses the public keys to establish

1258
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,990
an encrypted connection with Kenny keys

1259
00:46:58,990 --> 00:47:00,550
that are unique to that session so it's

1260
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:03,369
got similar functions I mean my question

1261
00:47:03,369 --> 00:47:05,770
is more are the radios themselves secure

1262
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:07,540
from attacking outside of that encrypted

1263
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:12,180
channel at all but I don't know yet

1264
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:16,240
other questions I don't think I see any

1265
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:20,368
hands so that's it thank you very much

1266
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:30,300
so like to thank dan is the presenters

1267
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:31,920
gift also like to thank dampers

1268
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,680
presentation and further he is report of

1269
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,840
Pittsburgh b-side since the beginning in

1270
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:38,850
2011 that's either an organizer a

1271
00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:40,800
presenter or both and over the past

1272
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,050
years I'll they stepped down your left

1273
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:45,210
organize your role while these continue

1274
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:46,820
to support us through submitting

1275
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:50,310
sympathies and speaking your winch's and

1276
00:47:50,310 --> 00:47:52,950
says thanks this year we have decided to

1277
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:55,590
give out one very special badge watching

1278
00:47:55,590 --> 00:47:58,650
bolt rubber bag to the end to think of

1279
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:00,660
brawls contributions is a information

1280
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:13,740
security community or camera so like to

1281
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:16,140
thank you and this family get you in the

1282
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:17,880
whole future b-sides Pittsburgh events

1283
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:21,480
differ so bad so I really appreciate

1284
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:24,800
that guys so please think

1285
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:34,829
i'd also wanted to thank our sponsors

1286
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:40,579
again this time our premier sponsor is

1287
00:48:40,579 --> 00:48:46,170
tres a sec platinum is a slimy security

1288
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:50,119
risk advisors a lovato was consoling

1289
00:48:50,119 --> 00:48:53,849
foresight and served so another round of

1290
00:48:53,849 --> 00:49:01,619
applause for our visitors you have a

1291
00:49:01,619 --> 00:49:03,839
date now logistical e we have a break

1292
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:09,470
and in about a half hour so sort of
