00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,299

58
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:11,530
female raise your hand yeah yeah there's

59
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,530
not as many and we need more in this

60
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,910
this industry

61
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:26,170

62
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,659
long time thank you appreciate your

63
00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:31,030
patience with the registration will

64
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,040
figure out efficiencies without one of

65
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,409
these years we have a full day of great

66
00:03:35,409 --> 00:03:36,939
talks and there's opportunity to network

67
00:03:36,939 --> 00:03:39,430
with each other so take full advantage

68
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:42,310
of that some logistics looks like

69
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,750
there's an exit in the back for

70
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:49,510
emergencies bathrooms are up here up the

71
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,040
steps and then if you go downstairs

72
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,400
there down the steps women and men or on

73
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,379
one side here but and go downstairs are

74
00:03:56,379 --> 00:03:57,819
in the opposite side says their stuff

75
00:03:57,819 --> 00:04:02,519
where I ones will run from 1130 to 130

76
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:05,440
we did it this way talks are going to

77
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,900
keep going and it through that because

78
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,450
I'd rather have you eaten see talks

79
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,870
versus not to as many talks so I'd

80
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,819
rather have more talks so we put them in

81
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:21,910
that way did I miss anything both are

82
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:29,190
asking about Wi-Fi Wi-Fi no real Wi-Fi

83
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,629
yeah I wouldn't connect to a hacker con

84
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:36,940
Wi-Fi

85
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:41,780
in fact that reminds me i wonder if I

86
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,680
already associated that somebody's I

87
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:51,590
better turn that off so parking by the

88
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,900
way if you're parked across the street

89
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,900
not to the left or right you'll want to

90
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,630
move because I don't think they want you

91
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,070
to park there and they'll tell you I

92
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:04,580
heard so we want to find street parking

93
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,410
because I think the other two lots are

94
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:09,050
probably full by now so if you need to

95
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:12,550
leave and I move your car
