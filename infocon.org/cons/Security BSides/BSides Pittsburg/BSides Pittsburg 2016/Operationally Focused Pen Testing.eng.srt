1
00:00:00,439 --> 00:00:03,149
next up is Greg Anderson on

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:07,259
operationally focused pen testing thank

3
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:19,410
you all right so definitely looks like

4
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,510
the audience is thinned out after lunch

5
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,140
so how many people in the audience are

6
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,810
either pen testers internally for their

7
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,609
organization or performant as an

8
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:31,619
external party yeah and my entire team

9
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:35,579
got it all right what about procures of

10
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:36,719
pen test we have any of those the

11
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,160
audience people who are going to all

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,190
right not a whole lot i'm surprised all

13
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,780
right so this talk is going to kind of

14
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,870
help you guys work together i hope it's

15
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,850
kind of got a dual audience to it i'm

16
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,469
hoping a lot of this information can be

17
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:51,840
used by both parties pen tester side to

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,550
make you better pen testers help you

19
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,010
deliver better products as well as on

20
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,140
the consumer side to help you expect

21
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,739
more from your pen testers so a little

22
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:04,589
bit about me right now I work for certs

23
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:06,510
risk and vulnerability assessment team

24
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,380
the team's job is performing pen tests

25
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,110
for Department of Homeland Security

26
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:16,350
federal local some state and other

27
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,860
municipalities previously to that I've

28
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,259
been in IT Help Desk since pretty much

29
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:24,600
high school done network administration

30
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,509
domain administration security analysis

31
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:29,340
and previously a little bit of GRC work

32
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,979
to in the nuclear industry it's my

33
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:33,509
follow me information if you'd like to

34
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:38,640
know more so we're gonna talk about pen

35
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,259
testing a little bit in here but why pen

36
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:42,780
testing right so we have pretty much a

37
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,200
decade of high profile data breaches and

38
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,909
at least the last five years we've seen

39
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:50,340
a lot more of data breaches which has

40
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,740
caused this real increased observation

41
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,930
awareness of cybersecurity a lot from

42
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,850
the general public side even more so

43
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,640
than the IT side as normal what we've

44
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,860
got now is governance framework starting

45
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,020
to address cyber Sarah pentesting it a

46
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,520
little bit of a high level they're at

47
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,610
least mentioning it now regulations and

48
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,050
compliance are starting to demand more

49
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,510
there's been a lot of reference to PCI

50
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,440
there at least

51
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,870
the regulations that are saying adieu

52
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,880
pentesting on a regular basis so that's

53
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,550
at least a good thing and then even mass

54
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,140
media coverage it's like less some of

55
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,000
those last few data breaches especially

56
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,770
target you've actually seen people in

57
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,300
the news talking about well when was the

58
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,580
last time they had a pen test done so

59
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,140
it's really kind of interesting to see

60
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,360
that kind of progression towards pen

61
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,160
testing in just you know general public

62
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,870
but why pen testing who really cares why

63
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,600
is it important though current risk

64
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,730
analysis methods are a little bit

65
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,610
subjective believe it or not so we have

66
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,200
things like probability likelihood

67
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,870
impact and even threat actors some of

68
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,850
these things can be subjective for the

69
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,650
people to perform the ascent forming the

70
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,690
risk analysis their biases can interfere

71
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,670
with it and in other times it can be

72
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,950
downright volatile so you might not

73
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,960
consider hacktivism in your risk

74
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,970
analysis mechanism but then your CEO

75
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,830
make some statement on the news and

76
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,930
you've offended you know all sorts of

77
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,070
people that now want to target your

78
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,930
organization from a hacking standpoint

79
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,120
that was never considered in your risk

80
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,840
management profile before and even on

81
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,910
the worst side of that sometimes you can

82
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:25,579
deliberately alter your risk analysis

83
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,750
formulas and those sorts of things by

84
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,180
skewing the inputs to reflect the output

85
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,750
that you want so long story short

86
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,510
objective risk analysis takes very

87
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,670
disciplined and mature organization to

88
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,440
do it effectively and one of the things

89
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,120
that pen testing can do is help you

90
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,890
validate these conclusions that you've

91
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,470
made about your risk though ongoing

92
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,480
cycles of performing your risk analysis

93
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,120
validating with pen testing addressing

94
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,890
your risk analysis going back to pen

95
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:55,410
testing again and help fine-tune this

96
00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:00,750
maturity over time on the other side

97
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,420
demand has created sort of this low

98
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,209
supply of quality pen tests that are out

99
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:08,459
there in the world today we see a lot of

100
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:10,650
things like just validated vulnerability

101
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,290
scans passing for compliance mechanisms

102
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,890
yep check the box we did our pen test in

103
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,870
other cases we see scope being so

104
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,579
tightly constrained that it doesn't

105
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,800
reflect reality at all but again you get

106
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,260
that compliance check box this does

107
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,210
happen a lot in pc i don't mean to beat

108
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,889
on PC I know it's been on a few slides

109
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:31,650
here but a lot of times you'll see well

110
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,660
that's not our prick payment processing

111
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,240
systems so we're not going to address

112
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,699
that during a pen test but in reality it

113
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:40,710
does provide an attack path into your

114
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,240
payment processing environment so it

115
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,599
should be addressed another thing here

116
00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:47,849
is their technology focus as opposed to

117
00:04:47,849 --> 00:04:50,400
business focus we always forget as

118
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,259
technology professionals that technology

119
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:54,690
only lives in an organization to serve

120
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,120
the business so we need to address these

121
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,410
things from the business side as well

122
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:01,349
not just patch this fix this and there

123
00:05:01,349 --> 00:05:03,360
performed in a vacuum right it's just a

124
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,550
pen test it's a report it goes into

125
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,500
someone's file somebody might look at it

126
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,030
someday but there's really no

127
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,380
interaction with the rest of the

128
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,210
business on a lot of these things though

129
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,940
the end results drastically decreasing

130
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,280
the business value of the pen test there

131
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,900
is generally a negative perception

132
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,419
especially in compliance space we have

133
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:23,550
this really high cost service that we're

134
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,710
providing and nobody really cares it's

135
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,539
the same cost as the other check boxes

136
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:30,569
in our compliance process and a lot of

137
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:31,860
times there's this adversarial nature

138
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,840
with the pen test right you're coming in

139
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,360
to test our ability to run do our jobs

140
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,120
is the way it's viewed a lot of times

141
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,440
and at the end of the day we're just not

142
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,479
meeting the expectations on the previous

143
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,820
slide of what we intended for a pen test

144
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:48,360
to be so a bottom line there's a bit of

145
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,590
a disconnect right we have what we

146
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,389
expected pen test to be to help us

147
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:54,750
validate risk but then we're not living

148
00:05:54,750 --> 00:06:00,000
up to those mechanisms right so where do

149
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,590
we go from here how do we bridge a gap

150
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,780
how do we reconnect our expectations as

151
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,240
to what's actually being delivered but I

152
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,710
think first and foremost we have to

153
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,719
identify what we do well because as pen

154
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:11,400
testers there's a lot of things that are

155
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,800
done very well and we should keep doing

156
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,090
those things i'm not saying anything's

157
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,310
changed there but we have to have that

158
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,979
self analysis to actually say okay we

159
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:21,690
have areas that need improved so let's

160
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:24,990
look at the proving those and here's a

161
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,849
kind of breakdown of some of the things

162
00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:29,400
that we do from if you look at kind of

163
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,949
the pitas or other standards the

164
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:33,389
breakdowns are the phases of the pen

165
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:35,190
test so on the left we kind of our good

166
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:38,460
side which is pretty much we're going to

167
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,169
see a lot of the technical stuff right

168
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:40,740
recon

169
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,500
on our Oh sent capabilities handing an

170
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,050
enumeration our exploitation these are

171
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,000
things we often focus our time on our

172
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,030
own a professional development on we do

173
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,250
really good at those things but on the

174
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,380
other side of like our methodology we've

175
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,539
got pre-engagement capabilities actually

176
00:06:57,539 --> 00:06:59,039
scoping these engagements out so they

177
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,190
provide value to the business post

178
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,870
exploitation where we actually kind of

179
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,990
go after the crown jewels we actually

180
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,310
address what matters to the business

181
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,590
from a technical standpoint and then

182
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,330
actually conveying this information so

183
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:14,430
it means something to the business so

184
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,169
really the rest of this talk is going to

185
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,150
kind of take a detour from the where

186
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:20,639
most pen test talks go and really

187
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,830
address the right side of this the

188
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,720
methodology here where we're focusing on

189
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,460
so are the soft skills that make pen

190
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:32,130
testers good so bottom line pen testing

191
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,330
is more of an art than a science there's

192
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:34,770
a lot of things we have to fine-tune

193
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:36,539
it's not just plugging into a formula or

194
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,400
with a lot of automation stuff we've

195
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,349
been hearing I think someday we can

196
00:07:40,349 --> 00:07:41,729
automate pen testing but right now

197
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:43,800
humans have to do it so we got to kind

198
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,889
of fine tune those capabilities pen

199
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:48,360
testers are great at technology we've

200
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,590
always been good at tech and we always

201
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:51,360
seek new ways like attending this

202
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,830
conference to learn new things about

203
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:55,560
technology at the same time though we

204
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,919
need to spend the same amount of effort

205
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,090
fine-tuning our business acumen that we

206
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,650
actually do these things better for the

207
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,240
business because again this is a

208
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,199
business service not technical service

209
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:08,099
though here's kind of how this is going

210
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:09,599
to break down for the rest my agenda

211
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,819
slides like 10 slides in here's what

212
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:12,750
we're going to talk about for the rest

213
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,039
of the talk here so we're going to talk

214
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:15,449
about sort of that pre-engagement phase

215
00:08:15,449 --> 00:08:17,099
that we just looked at we're going to

216
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:18,780
talk about goal-oriented pen testing to

217
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,340
help drive that along for the business

218
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,169
we're going to look at what the

219
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,509
objective of the pen test actually is

220
00:08:24,509 --> 00:08:26,520
and kind of refresh our view of that as

221
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,699
well as look at how we report on some of

222
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:31,380
these things let's talk beyond

223
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,839
technologies to the business and look at

224
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,828
who our audience actually is without

225
00:08:37,828 --> 00:08:39,899
further ado a little bit on goal

226
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:41,458
oriented pen testing so this isn't a new

227
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:44,459
idea I forget his name now I knew it

228
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:46,709
when I wrote the slide deck but this is

229
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:48,029
a concept that's been out for a while I

230
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:49,410
just haven't seen it got a whole lot of

231
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:52,140
traction but goalie and goal oriented

232
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,279
pen testing is really just define

233
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:57,189
a an objective a goal for the pen

234
00:08:57,189 --> 00:09:00,579
testers that's measurable i used the

235
00:09:00,579 --> 00:09:01,990
smart slide here which I'm sure

236
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:03,639
everybody hates because it's the same

237
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:04,629
thing you see for your performance

238
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:07,209
reviews making your goals you know

239
00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:09,939
specific measurable and actionable but

240
00:09:09,939 --> 00:09:11,259
there's some credit there's some good

241
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,699
things in this right especially when

242
00:09:12,699 --> 00:09:13,689
we're looking at the pen testing

243
00:09:13,689 --> 00:09:16,029
standpoint because when organizations

244
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:17,949
tell you oh we want you to come in and

245
00:09:17,949 --> 00:09:21,610
hack us okay what does that mean or we

246
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:23,290
need you to fish us or to show us you

247
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:25,029
can exploit this it doesn't provide a

248
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:28,029
whole lot of understanding where do we

249
00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:29,829
manage expectations what exactly do you

250
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:33,160
want us to do so instead of those kind

251
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,689
of high-level statements here are some

252
00:09:34,689 --> 00:09:36,220
examples of how we can actually leverage

253
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,649
goal oriented goals in our pen testing

254
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:41,110
though demonstrating the ability to

255
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:44,529
exfiltrate PII from the HR systems from

256
00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:46,180
an external network attack within the

257
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,430
confines of your two-week engagement

258
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:50,230
that's fairly clear no it doesn't

259
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,699
specifically go into a lot of the rules

260
00:09:51,699 --> 00:09:52,959
of engagement type things that you'll

261
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,660
talk about but at least you have some

262
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,540
type of focus now and at the end of the

263
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,100
day this is going to help you manage a

264
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,250
lot of your expectations in reporting

265
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,509
another example here compromise the

266
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:06,370
domain admin credentials within a 30-day

267
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:08,290
kind of reconnaissance and fishing

268
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:10,269
campaign there's your scope down to

269
00:10:10,269 --> 00:10:12,040
something you understand no what we can

270
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,620
do kind of takes which the boundaries

271
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,930
around what's expected and then again we

272
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,250
kind of a last one here just gaining

273
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,980
undetected access to a secured network

274
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,829
this case an ICS network within some red

275
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:25,240
team engagement that takes a longer

276
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,000
period of time kind of under

277
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,740
underscoring the fact that you know we

278
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:32,079
want this to be somewhat stealthy do

279
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,550
those sorts of things over your 90-day

280
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,500
engagement helps bring everything

281
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,970
together so what do we do to get there

282
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,620
this is all well and good but how do we

283
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,000
actually define it so again this is

284
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,439
pre-engagement this is talking about

285
00:10:44,439 --> 00:10:46,480
your scope with your business executives

286
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,000
or the at least your points of contact

287
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,029
within the organization and you're

288
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:53,170
really going to try and focus on

289
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:54,999
identify why they're looking to perform

290
00:10:54,999 --> 00:10:56,649
this pen test in the first place right

291
00:10:56,649 --> 00:10:59,470
there's a reason they're somewhere and

292
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:01,569
it may require some fishing not that

293
00:11:01,569 --> 00:11:04,629
kind we want to actually just kind of

294
00:11:04,629 --> 00:11:05,889
kind of sounds weird going from

295
00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:07,470
technology people but havoc on

296
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:10,440
versation with them try asking some

297
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,210
open-ended questions not just yes/no

298
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:14,430
questions I listed some examples here

299
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:17,460
but there is no template for this what

300
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,080
do you hope to gain out of it kind of

301
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,340
get them thinking about the process

302
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:23,970
order your concerns one of the things I

303
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:25,890
like in here is ask them about their

304
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,570
strengths instead of their weaknesses

305
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,250
right everyone loves talking about their

306
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,470
strikes when's the last time you were on

307
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,820
a job interview and I started telling

308
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,860
you how the company sucked ask them

309
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,360
about their strengths first and that's

310
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,860
going to give you insight into where

311
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,930
their weaknesses might be and then you

312
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:40,980
can outright ask them after they're

313
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,720
comfortable talking about it what are

314
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,390
your weaknesses and then what are your

315
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:47,310
security concerns this is often it's

316
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,560
worded as what keeps you up at night I

317
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,480
know a lot of CIOs that sleep very well

318
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,700
so that might not be a valid argument

319
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:58,470
question to ask but why would this be

320
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,840
important so we kind of talked about a

321
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,310
little bit but it's going to give the

322
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:04,740
pen tester a clear objective of what's

323
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:09,270
being required from the pen test manages

324
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,520
expectations you know what's supposed to

325
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,170
happen the organization knows what they

326
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,550
want we're going to meet in the middle

327
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,660
and we're going to deliver exactly

328
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,750
what's expected to the organization it's

329
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,100
going to help them validate their risk

330
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,240
so if you're having this conversation

331
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,400
with them at the beginning during scope

332
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,920
definition get a feel for what their

333
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,300
risks are are they going to give you

334
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,280
their risk analysis probably not but

335
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,750
through some of those questions you can

336
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,250
start to identify they're putting a lot

337
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,220
of value here we should look here or

338
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,650
security vulnerabilities and then use

339
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,420
that in your report so they can use it

340
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,800
later to validate their own risk

341
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,130
conclusions and if nothing else it's

342
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,600
going to make you reporting a lot easier

343
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,250
pen testers hate reporting I hate

344
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,980
reporting if you have a template already

345
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,770
of what's being expected out of it right

346
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,810
to the expectations your jobs almost

347
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,850
done before you start especially for the

348
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:02,250
executive summary portion of it all

349
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,930
right this section redefining the

350
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:06,750
objective so we want to look at the pen

351
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,570
testers objective during the process

352
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:12,570
here so I hear a lot of times talking

353
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:13,770
about pen testing especially to the

354
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:15,480
non-security specific audience mostly

355
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,330
more the IT operations personnel about a

356
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,980
pen test being you know we

357
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,030
we want you to come in and find all of

358
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,700
our vulnerabilities nope not going to

359
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,340
happen use a scanner scanners are much

360
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,540
better at finding all your

361
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,100
vulnerabilities than a human is going to

362
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,700
be so the job of the pen tester is

363
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,620
really to find a viable attack path I

364
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,790
don't care if you have a hundred

365
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:38,370
vulnerabilities if I find the one that

366
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:39,960
gives me access to your organization

367
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,130
that has some impact to your

368
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,870
organization that's the one I'm going to

369
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,070
use I don't care about the rest of all

370
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:47,070
and then I want to use it to demonstrate

371
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:49,800
the business impact so like I said once

372
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,470
you're in use it to go out and touch

373
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,240
something right see what else is out

374
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,940
there go after the crown jewels and then

375
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,070
identify and measure or identify

376
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,530
measures to eliminate or minimize that

377
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:04,110
attack path though often these are

378
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:07,170
technical attack paths obviously so how

379
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:08,760
can we minimize that how can we make

380
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,280
that attack surface smaller that way the

381
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,070
organization's risk is ultimately lower

382
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:16,680
and then reducing business impact is the

383
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,270
end goal right if we can't eliminate the

384
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,640
tack path how do we mitigate risk so of

385
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:25,200
this analogy here or this list here most

386
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,850
of the time these two things are

387
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:28,740
addressed by pretty much every pentester

388
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,720
right we get an attack path we get in

389
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,340
and we tell you how to fix those things

390
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:35,220
that got us in what we tend to slack on

391
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:38,220
is what's the business impact of what we

392
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,070
did and how do we reduce the business

393
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:45,000
impact though will address those two

394
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,910
things here so in the post exploitation

395
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:52,520
phase it's all about business impact

396
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,660
Carlos Perez actually has a great

397
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,600
website where is slow again for the

398
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,040
website is actually shell is just the

399
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,360
beginning I think that's a great analogy

400
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,310
for this because it's it is it's the

401
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,780
beginning now is where you can actually

402
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:06,360
demonstrate what cert the service you're

403
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,540
providing demonstrate what value it has

404
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,310
the wrong answer here what's you know

405
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,500
why does the attack path matter well we

406
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,420
got domain admin and high-fives and

407
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:18,750
we're out you look really ignorant when

408
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,940
you do this sort of thing because domain

409
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,830
admin really doesn't resonate well with

410
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,990
the executives in the organization they

411
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,670
don't care okay great how does that

412
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:30,960
matter to me um it's just it's just too

413
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,760
broad wrap it around in context that

414
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,800
actually resonates with you

415
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,720
organization so instead you're going to

416
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,910
want to think about okay we got domain

417
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,709
admin credentials where do they work

418
00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:43,279
obviously in the domain what can we do

419
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,950
with the credentials what impact does

420
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,600
this have on the business of what system

421
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,310
did you gain access to what value does

422
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:51,440
that provide that could be you know your

423
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,810
email systems domain controllers other

424
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:56,510
system HRAs systems anything where you

425
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,430
can actually find valuable data from

426
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:00,350
your scoping conversations that might

427
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,820
allow them to understand that risk a

428
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:05,600
little better at the end of the day how

429
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,190
do we measure it though right business

430
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,930
impact means so many different things to

431
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:12,320
so many different organizations but one

432
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,779
we often rely on is dollars and cents

433
00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:17,690
easy we're going to steal money from you

434
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:18,890
or you're going to get a bad reputation

435
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:23,450
etc etc this is losing ground I think

436
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,880
though I now to talk about this

437
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,709
yesterday a little bit where we're

438
00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:29,630
seeing the stock market trend differ

439
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:32,450
from way it used to write so target home

440
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,070
depot or some examples of this where

441
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:36,800
yeah they took a huge hit financially

442
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,250
from stock trading after their breeches

443
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,930
but then it rebounded not that long

444
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:44,180
after that far beyond where it had ever

445
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,850
been so if you're talking to the CFO

446
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:48,500
about well you're going to get bad press

447
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,959
from this they're gonna say who cares

448
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,579
it's temporary we're going to rebound

449
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:53,990
customers are still going to come here

450
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:57,560
bye-bye so if you want to use dollars

451
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,470
put it in the context of their Incident

452
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,779
Response their capabilities that one

453
00:17:02,779 --> 00:17:05,359
time fee that's gone so I just read a

454
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,609
statistic recently on fishing costing

455
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,199
just fishing that we're not talking data

456
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,619
breach costing organizations roughly 3.7

457
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:15,199
million dollars a year so use that

458
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,359
number instead of focusing on their

459
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,579
stock market performance right and that

460
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:22,189
3.7 million is their Incident Response

461
00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:23,929
their lost productivity their

462
00:17:23,929 --> 00:17:25,609
containment through his recovery and all

463
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:27,500
those sorts of things that number is

464
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,910
going to resonate well with the

465
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:31,160
organization versus you're going to get

466
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,160
a bad reputation that kind of ties into

467
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,809
production so if you know lost

468
00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:38,090
productivity some other things are up

469
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:44,110
time so if you're or uh yeah uptime or

470
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:46,429
if you think of like amazon shipping

471
00:17:46,429 --> 00:17:47,550
organizations those

472
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,320
things if their control systems that you

473
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,610
may have compromised during a pen test

474
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,170
go down they can't ship things anymore

475
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,330
that's a big deal those are things that

476
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:56,430
need to be looked at one that's getting

477
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,320
actually increased popularity search

478
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,600
engine optimization very valuable to

479
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,090
people you go into some organizations

480
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:04,590
and tell them that new ciphers are going

481
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,720
to increase their search engine hits

482
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,280
they're going to get placed higher on

483
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,560
that issues fixed already so put it in

484
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,720
context that they understand learn the

485
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,700
business don't just assume you know

486
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,610
everything because you hacked in and

487
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:18,960
relate the technical findings that you

488
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,070
have because they are very valuable

489
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,810
we're late on to what matters to the

490
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,430
business though get in their heads a

491
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:27,750
little bit why is it important I guess

492
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,580
we kind of touched some of this so it

493
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,870
gives a lot more credibility your

494
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,820
technical findings because a lot of

495
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,170
times they don't understand what you're

496
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:36,300
talking about I was listening to the

497
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,850
crypto talk going I don't understand any

498
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:41,490
of this but I'm sure it's great in

499
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:43,350
creates a driver for remediation right

500
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:46,590
if you can put this in terms that they

501
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,720
can understand and they can use now

502
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,400
they've got a little fire lit under them

503
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,810
to actually get these things taken care

504
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:54,030
of rather than a report just sitting on

505
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:58,470
someone's desk somewhere so our last

506
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,000
section here was actually two in this

507
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,930
one a reporting face so we often think

508
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:08,130
about technology so much and this is a

509
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,570
quote that I put in here specifically

510
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:10,830
for who it came from and the

511
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,210
organization that I thought was valuable

512
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:14,520
but too many think that the solution to

513
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,380
most problems is a technology control

514
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,750
rather than people in process and I

515
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,250
thought this is actually came from a

516
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,350
like a workforce development article

517
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,450
talking about you know people fresh out

518
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,620
of college always want to use technology

519
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,020
solutions for everything but the fact

520
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,000
that it came from the VP of core core

521
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,740
security who makes you know you can

522
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,210
criticize it all you want there are

523
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:34,800
flaws in it but one of the most powerful

524
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,350
pen testing platforms on the market so

525
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,640
they do some of their own vulnerability

526
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,310
analysis the fact that this pen testing

527
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,380
VP is fun saying that you know there's

528
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,790
people and processes involved in this

529
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:46,800
too that kind of resonates with exactly

530
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,150
this topic here where it's not just

531
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:53,130
about technologies that goes right down

532
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:55,560
the pathway of we've kind of in pigeon

533
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:59,010
holed as this technology service but in

534
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:01,380
the end that's kind of our fault we fo

535
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,930
is so heavily on technologies we have to

536
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:05,340
get better at that kind of business side

537
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:08,190
of things as well and these technical

538
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:10,680
findings that we have are often linked

539
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,840
to larger problems their symptoms right

540
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,000
you went into the doctors offices that I

541
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,710
feel sick he's like well yeah you've got

542
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,660
a cough yeah you're probably not going

543
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,010
to go to that doctor anymore you want to

544
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,810
know why you have a cough all right

545
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:23,760
these are drivers there's human driven

546
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,560
processes underneath these things that

547
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,360
actually cause the symptoms that you're

548
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,840
finding in a pen test so we actually

549
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,920
need to become familiar with these

550
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,020
understand the operational deficiencies

551
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:37,410
that actually lead to these findings so

552
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:39,180
as an example right so a pen tester

553
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,890
takes advantage of some telnet varner

554
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,480
ability the system happens to be

555
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,110
listening on telnet and ssh our tip end

556
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,340
up and the vulnerabilities two months

557
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,500
old that's an important part so our

558
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,730
typical recommendation is going to be

559
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:52,260
well there's a vulnerability there's you

560
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,090
should apply the patch and you've got

561
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:55,860
two redundant services listening so

562
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,860
disabled one if you're not using it

563
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,440
that's great that fixes that one problem

564
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,330
but it only addresses that one problem

565
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:05,460
there's probably other systems in their

566
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,870
environment that you didn't compromise

567
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:09,810
that have this same problem so you're

568
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,610
not looking at why this problem exists

569
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:14,280
in the first place a better way to do

570
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,900
this would be well of course apply the

571
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,990
mission patch right you need to do that

572
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:21,840
however do that soon and then look at

573
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,460
why was that there in the first place

574
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,660
let's look at your patch management

575
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,970
program maybe you should reduce your

576
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:29,130
patch window down to something 30 to 45

577
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:30,930
days you're not having two month old

578
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:33,470
patches that are out there in the wild

579
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,580
they're missing patches that are out

580
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,440
there in the wild and then maybe in

581
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,180
another 90 to 60 days you probably have

582
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,160
some configuration management issues or

583
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,320
you're not reviewing these things if you

584
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,420
have both telnet and ssh on in your

585
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:49,290
environment and then later to a year mr.

586
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:51,090
90 days to a year establish a baseline

587
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:53,840
configurations do some analysis on those

588
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,250
periodically check for Veet deviations

589
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,630
to the baseline and then use your

590
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:59,490
instant response program to respond to

591
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:01,710
those if any deviations occur writing

592
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:03,840
this roadmap of services like this or

593
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,060
ideas like this is drastically going to

594
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,530
improve the value that you're providing

595
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:10,250
as a pen tester

596
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:15,470
but it's difficult right we're technical

597
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:16,700
people we don't always understand the

598
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,900
operational side of things in

599
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,480
organization so how do we get there well

600
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,340
I like to think of it in the context of

601
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,740
you're all smart people what would have

602
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,240
stopped your hack right if they would

603
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,620
have patched this two months ago or a

604
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,990
month before you got there that would

605
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:31,670
have stopped your hack they're thinking

606
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:34,610
in those kind of concepts of what human

607
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:36,860
actions may have gotten in the way of me

608
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:39,130
moving forward in my attack path and

609
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:41,120
then how do you make the full

610
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,190
recommendation well there's tools out

611
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,870
there to do this though the critical

612
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:48,290
security controls are very accessible to

613
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:49,430
a technical audience they're all

614
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:52,370
tactical controls and there's mappings

615
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,890
of those things that exist to the more

616
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:57,890
operational controls like NIST in ISO so

617
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:01,400
if you can digest the technical critical

618
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,280
controls and understand those all oh the

619
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,350
mappings to what operational controls in

620
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:09,440
an organization would address these

621
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,720
technical findings and then kind of make

622
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,000
the full pathway for them so go from

623
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,480
your technical critical controls to the

624
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,620
nist 853 your ISO standards and then

625
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,750
write that up into your recommendation

626
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,490
so that way you have kind of this full

627
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:27,410
path of the environment you understand

628
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:29,210
being heavily technical as a pen tester

629
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:31,820
to something that the organization can

630
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,350
understand operationally and actually

631
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:36,460
implement that will address broader

632
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,750
broader vulnerabilities than just the

633
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:45,050
technology had why is this important so

634
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,120
we're addressing beyond that superficial

635
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,610
patch right patching this system there's

636
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:51,050
20 other systems out there that need

637
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:53,150
patched as well it provides them a

638
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:55,520
roadmap so instead of just saying here's

639
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,050
a list of things you can do here's a

640
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:58,820
prioritized list of things that are

641
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:01,280
going to provide you ignore value over

642
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,990
the long run than just applying these

643
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:05,930
patches that we found and it's going to

644
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:08,000
provide them a way to address

645
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,620
vulnerabilities that you didn't find

646
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,930
that they didn't know they had or that

647
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:14,060
aren't even published vulnerabilities

648
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,190
yet right you can stop zero days that's

649
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:19,100
an amazing idea right good cybersecurity

650
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,930
hygiene this is allows you to do can

651
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:23,960
stop zere it is and you're going to

652
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,000
identify more than just that preventive

653
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,910
control so often we think in fix it

654
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:31,040
prevent it from ever happening we can

655
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,410
actually identify those detective and

656
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:35,420
response mechanisms that can go forward

657
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,130
into helping them have a better security

658
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:40,370
posture at the end of the day it's going

659
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:41,870
to significantly increase the business

660
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:44,060
value you're providing so if nothing

661
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,440
else you might get paid more to pen

662
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,870
tester all right speaking to your

663
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:54,860
audience so this is kind of a big one so

664
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,410
this is my opinion so who read your pen

665
00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:00,020
test report right executives the

666
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,000
managers of staff who actually implement

667
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,040
stuff and then that technical staff who

668
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,500
actually goes and implements things each

669
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,480
of these audiences need something

670
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,270
specific they're different out of their

671
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:14,420
pen test or out of that report however

672
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,760
most pen testers right there reports as

673
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,410
if they're being read by other pen

674
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:20,750
testers they want to look cool and

675
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:23,630
that's fine no that stuff's fun but at

676
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:25,700
the end of the day that's not who's

677
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:29,450
reading your report in most cases we

678
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:30,950
have kind of the three audience here so

679
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:32,390
we have executives so the reports

680
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:34,220
section that they get makes sense would

681
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:37,220
be the executive summary their primary

682
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,230
concern that you need to communicate in

683
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:41,330
the executive summary is going to be the

684
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:43,220
business impact and how do we move

685
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,900
forward right what impact does it have

686
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:48,530
on us where do we go from here one

687
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:50,570
approach Express business impact in

688
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:51,950
terms of matter to the business so like

689
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,750
we talked about dollars and cents if

690
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:57,860
it's appropriate supplies production up

691
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:00,140
time SEO whatever the case may be that's

692
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,720
going to be different for every business

693
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,670
then briefly summarize your findings in

694
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:06,350
terms of operational and management

695
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:09,230
controls not hatches right you should

696
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,180
not read about ms 08 06 seven and an

697
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:14,180
executive summary your findings should

698
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,830
be tactical they should be here and now

699
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:18,530
right this is what we found completely

700
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:25,820
factual help relate the findings to that

701
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,230
goal of the pen test like we talked

702
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:29,000
about previously so if your goal was

703
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,640
very specific how did your findings how

704
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,910
did your attack path relate to that goal

705
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:36,830
I'm trying to keep the Garvin jargon and

706
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,780
CBE SMS numbers like I mentioned those

707
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:39,030
should

708
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,320
out of the executive summary those are

709
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,140
for later and focus on remediation right

710
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,760
we want to address talk about the

711
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,440
findings but we want to focus on moving

712
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,910
forward like I said so focus on

713
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,550
remediation something strategic

714
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,720
something that they can really grasp a

715
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,340
hold of and start holding people below

716
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,770
them accountable for address the big

717
00:26:55,770 --> 00:27:00,800
picture talk about programs not systems

718
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,650
if in the next section so managers our

719
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:06,300
staff is your next audience their

720
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,490
primary section of the report should be

721
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:10,050
the main body to report that should be

722
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:11,970
theirs should have a nice flow to it

723
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,830
shouldn't be interrupted by plethora of

724
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:16,110
tables and data and outputs just main

725
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:19,530
body that's concise primary concern

726
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:21,210
there is going to be remediation right

727
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:23,310
again we want to know what's broken but

728
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,480
more importantly they want to know how

729
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,660
to fix it summarize your IDs you're

730
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:30,420
finding IDs title severity etc they need

731
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,890
to know that information but they don't

732
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:34,140
need you know a book about it address

733
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,910
critical and high priority findings

734
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:38,220
first right that's what you're going to

735
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,870
do even if it's just patch it right that

736
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:41,570
needs addressed first if it's critical

737
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:43,830
then start looking at quickly and

738
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,960
operational stuff so like we had on the

739
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,600
previous example start looking at maybe

740
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,920
reducing your patch window if that's

741
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,590
appropriate start evaluating for changes

742
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:54,210
looking at your configuration management

743
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:55,500
program to see if it can be approved

744
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,720
those quick win type things then

745
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,150
long-term you do have strategic type

746
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:02,640
goals in there for them so incident

747
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,720
response to changes in your

748
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,510
configurations that way if anything does

749
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:08,370
change oh you have a separate another

750
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:10,170
port to enable now go in there and

751
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:11,280
identify that through your instant

752
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,430
response program then your technical

753
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:16,260
staff so this is again this is a section

754
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,180
where pen testers tend to do really well

755
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,490
at these should be in your appendix

756
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,080
though they should not be part of your

757
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,820
main report these are something that

758
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,080
could be torn off your report and then

759
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,220
hand it out to the people who actually

760
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:29,400
need to do things technical primary

761
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,020
concern technical findings no surprise

762
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,630
there you should have the detailed

763
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:34,950
attack narrative in here student

764
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:36,330
shouldn't just be a list of findings

765
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:39,360
though some context around what you did

766
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,940
why you did it in how it impacted them

767
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,370
things like the tools you use the

768
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:46,470
commands you use the host you targeted

769
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:47,850
where'd you gain a foothold where did

770
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:50,430
you move to after that something that's

771
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:51,900
kind of nice to see that I've seen in

772
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:52,770
some pen test

773
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:56,340
quartz is the validation this is how we

774
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,590
actually found the vulnerability we

775
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:01,560
exploited then if they come back to it

776
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,480
later down the road they fix it they

777
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,130
patch it they can use that string to

778
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:06,990
actually validate it on themselves that

779
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:10,440
it's been fixed and in other important

780
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,350
things give credit where credit's due

781
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,490
there's a lot of things that slow you

782
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:17,430
down during a pen test so you have

783
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:19,020
credit don't make it just all the bad

784
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,190
stuff about them it's really going to

785
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,450
help that relationship if you're

786
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:23,250
actually saying good things about them

787
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:26,790
in a report and your detailed list of

788
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,950
findings I'm not going to tell you what

789
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:31,230
you need to include in that but Taylor

790
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,970
your severity descriptions or

791
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:35,520
recommendations to the audience don't

792
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,350
just make it copy and paste that's fine

793
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:40,560
as a basis but a critical vulnerability

794
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,570
on one system might not be critical on

795
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:43,830
another system it just depends on what

796
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:45,570
it's performing so tailor it to the

797
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:46,860
people you're actually talking to in the

798
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,890
system's you've targeted and then again

799
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,690
the tools commands method you've used to

800
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:56,490
actually use the fight to find that why

801
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:57,840
is it important who really cares it's

802
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,820
just a report though it's the product

803
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,380
deliverable this is the proof you

804
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,120
actually did something during your pen

805
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,830
test and you didn't just sit there for

806
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:07,740
two weeks and each audience gets much

807
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,780
greater usability out of it right if

808
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,490
your executives have something to hold

809
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:12,870
your managers accountable for and your

810
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:14,040
managers have something that they're

811
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,690
looking their technical staff to do and

812
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,550
it's concisely written they're all

813
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:19,230
getting value out of it and they can use

814
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:22,710
it going forward again adds value to the

815
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:24,990
business and you as a pen tester right

816
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,460
they're getting value on it out of how

817
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,960
they can use it you're getting value out

818
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,100
of it could you performed a better

819
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,330
service you can increase your billing

820
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:34,800
rates if you'd like to so some key

821
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,850
takeaways from this before the pen

822
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:41,280
testers in the audience security

823
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,900
transcends technology it's not just

824
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,030
about the exploits there's actually a

825
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:46,920
good conversation yesterday about the

826
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,810
the 12 months or something before

827
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:50,340
somebody who said they've actually fired

828
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:53,070
an exploit it's all about usage the

829
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,810
operational processes they're using the

830
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:56,250
same passwords those sorts of things in

831
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:59,010
an organization broaden your skill set

832
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:01,320
to understand the business there are so

833
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,120
many other aspects to how a business

834
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,330
runs in the technology they run on at

835
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:06,630
the end

836
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:07,830
it's going to make you a better defend

837
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,030
tester right if you're thinking about

838
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:10,890
these operational aspects what human

839
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:12,450
things can do to get in the way of your

840
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:15,990
engagement and is positioned you as a

841
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:18,000
partner instead of a supplier of just a

842
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,350
service right you're there to help them

843
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,700
you're there to collaborate with them

844
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,530
either understand their problems to help

845
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:25,920
them get through it and it helps them

846
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,870
long past the engagement right it's not

847
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:29,130
just fixed this and we're going to go

848
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:31,980
away if you provide them that roadmap

849
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:34,170
you provide them as operational ideas

850
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:37,020
they're going to have more things digest

851
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,820
for a longer period of time to help them

852
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:42,300
over the long run and at the end of the

853
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,650
day they're adversarial nature that we

854
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:45,720
talked about you're coming in to tell

855
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,040
them all these things are doing wrong

856
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,630
nobody for their to partner with them to

857
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:51,030
collaborate with them going to start

858
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:52,770
breaking down the adversarial nature of

859
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:54,510
the engagement and again make you more

860
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:58,470
of a partner from the business side so

861
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:00,600
the consumers of pen tests so you can

862
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,070
kind of change how you think about pen

863
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,930
tests if you're thinking about it from

864
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:06,570
just that technology standpoint think

865
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:08,730
about it from the more operational

866
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,500
standpoint if they're fine if your pen

867
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,360
tester is finding certain things in your

868
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,790
organization why are those things there

869
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:18,090
why are those technical things there you

870
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:19,530
can provide you a lot of insight into

871
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:21,180
your risk analysis that you've done in

872
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,010
the past to help you validate what

873
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:25,140
you've done is it accurate does it

874
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:28,800
reflect reality and then demand more of

875
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,870
your pen testers right if the customers

876
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:32,550
are demanding pen tester is to provide

877
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,410
more operational in sight well guess

878
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,550
what pen testers are going to start

879
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,080
providing more operational in sight

880
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,140
right supply demand works ask for sample

881
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,450
reports chop around until you get what

882
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:43,620
you want from the pen testers or

883
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:46,140
somebody that can do it for you but big

884
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:49,260
thing here is just focus on the programs

885
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,790
that you're doing and how these pandas

886
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:55,530
can actually advance those programs that

887
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:57,480
is the end of my time so questions

888
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:05,550
comments concerns thank you very much I

889
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,080
appreciate being here

890
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,139
you
