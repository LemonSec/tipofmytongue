1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,860
so ladies and gentlemen let me introduce

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:08,580
our next speaker john just reminded me

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,710
that there is a microphone in the middle

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,570
of the floor right here if anybody wants

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,260
to ask questions um so this is dr.

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,289
Charles wood he's a professor and an

7
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:21,840
author he's written several books on

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,010
several topics um I think that it's

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,199
important for one of the things I love

10
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:30,599
about besides the most is that we get a

11
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:32,520
lot of a mix of a lot of different

12
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,940
people from the government from

13
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,430
corporations from academia I think that

14
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:39,660
one of the things that we've been

15
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,420
missing up here a lot is people from

16
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,280
academia and that's why i'm so happy

17
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,780
that dr. wood was accepted for the for

18
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,570
his talk he provides a lifeline into the

19
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,760
classroom for a switch i'm not sure that

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,340
we have such a good one so thanks a lot

21
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,730
doctor would thank you thank you thanks

22
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:05,309
everyone okay thanks yeah let me give

23
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:07,790
you a little bit of a background on this

24
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:10,950
my my topic on big data and information

25
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:16,490
security ended up being a a topic worm I

26
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:19,619
consider myself I I teach data analytics

27
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:21,360
at at Duquesne University and I teach

28
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,189
information security at Duquesne

29
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:27,030
University and so I consider myself kind

30
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,939
of an expert in both but they seem to be

31
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:32,759
a disjoint field and and uh there there

32
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,570
is really no need for that so I started

33
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,280
delving into other people out there

34
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,780
applying big data solutions to

35
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,579
information security and I found out

36
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:46,920
that there there are some i started this

37
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,360
about a year or two years ago and there

38
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,920
are some people that are really cutting

39
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,479
edge stuff i admit that this may not be

40
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,000
as technical as some besides

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,530
presentations that I've given and that

42
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:03,780
I've seen the it's meant to be at a

43
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,380
little bit higher level I i'm not sure

44
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,149
how how much experience the rest of you

45
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:11,780
have in big data and if you're all

46
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,800
experts in it then

47
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,940
and you're going to be bored but the the

48
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:20,660
that's where this came from anyway so

49
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,940
the problem that we have with a big data

50
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,270
is first off a lot of us see a lot of

51
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:30,510
data and say I I am big data you know if

52
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,640
you just look at my logs of you know

53
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,030
intrusion attempts every single day I

54
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,720
get 3,000 a day I'm big data and I

55
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,570
wanted to bring up a point that that

56
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:46,110
because you have lots of data you're

57
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,290
you're not necessarily big data you just

58
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,660
have lots of data and in fact the amount

59
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,050
of data that you get might might even be

60
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:59,130
as it starts to increase might even be a

61
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,530
very big strain on your corporations I

62
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,380
know that when I attend the security

63
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,660
seminars around town like I see a lot of

64
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:11,000
you there the the the quarterly

65
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,370
endpoints where you have to verify all

66
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:17,100
your controls and a lot of you realize

67
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,260
you know when those hits you you see

68
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,520
people coming to these conferences and

69
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,600
they look like they haven't slept and

70
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,060
they're all I got too stressed out look

71
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,310
on their face and they say yeah we have

72
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,650
to do all this work at the end of each

73
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,300
quarter and then next quarter it starts

74
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,220
all over again and every quarter it

75
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,250
grows and so and so they're dealing with

76
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,739
lots of data but you can see a problem

77
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:42,050
like that causes causes them to even

78
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:45,120
cause the more problems than then a

79
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,820
solution of the problem so so there is

80
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,830
lots of data the hacking attempts have

81
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:53,989
have increased one Pittsburgh company

82
00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:57,989
told me that they get 3,000 intrusion

83
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:03,750
attempts per day or day and that I don't

84
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,940
think you can put a network online and

85
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,709
not started getting like a thousand per

86
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:10,019
day I you know am I you know I could be

87
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:11,250
you know some of you might be saying

88
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,810
well we don't get any if you don't get

89
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,600
any you're probably being hacked but you

90
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,500
guys all know that that were preaching

91
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,430
to the choir so it so information

92
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,740
security is is a big data problem in and

93
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,470
of itself so how many people here are

94
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,600
considered themselves in big date

95
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,210
data analytics the regression and stuff

96
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,610
like that I am getting some some of you

97
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:35,340
that's good that's good so so this will

98
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:39,450
be a problem so what am I doing here

99
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,790
what are the problems and information

100
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,640
security that can be helped by big data

101
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,830
data analytics I use those terms

102
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,800
interchangeably and and one of the

103
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,150
problems you're going to run into and

104
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,350
what has big data and I put no really

105
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:59,490
there because I've run into a lot of

106
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,890
people that say especially outside the

107
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:04,380
the information technology we're a big

108
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,660
data firm we do big data we we have to

109
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,160
get and you say what do you mean and

110
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,580
they say well we have a 2 terabytes of

111
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,130
data in our database I'm like well

112
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,770
that's not big data that's just a big

113
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,080
database you know that's that's not what

114
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,870
what it means companies have realized

115
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,210
that some companies and what they do is

116
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:26,130
a lot of times nothing but a lot of

117
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:29,060
times they put on a new front end and

118
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:33,210
and say we're a big data company and if

119
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:34,470
you actually pushed on what they're

120
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,030
doing they've done the same thing for

121
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,430
you know they've had updates but they've

122
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,320
done the same thing for 20 years you

123
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,600
know for 15 years where there there

124
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,390
there are 10 years where they came out

125
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:48,000
with a product and the product deals

126
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,930
with a lot of data and they they do what

127
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:54,540
I first heard this term used in cloud

128
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,430
computing where every company said they

129
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,590
were a cloud computing company you guys

130
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,050
obviously remember that right and and it

131
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,300
still exists somewhat to today where

132
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,170
they're saying oh yeah we're cloud

133
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,850
computing and you go what he did well we

134
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:08,070
provide updates online automatically I'm

135
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,750
like well you've always done that and

136
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,900
and do do we do any work on in the cloud

137
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,020
no you downloaded to your servers so we

138
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,520
do everything yet the server level but

139
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,320
we put you get updates on the cloud and

140
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:23,910
so that that's the way of a colleague of

141
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:27,330
mine not well of ours not a not a myself

142
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,910
came up with the term cloud spray where

143
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,710
they would take a product that exists

144
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:33,810
already and cloud spray it and say we're

145
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,370
cloud now and the same thing as a

146
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:40,020
happens with a big data took me a real

147
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:40,289
long

148
00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:43,259
time to make that paint can but uh but

149
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:46,860
the V they they take an existing system

150
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,909
that uses a lot of data and they say I'm

151
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:52,740
gonna say it's big data and the

152
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,119
marketing department says say it's big

153
00:06:54,119 --> 00:06:56,550
data say it's big data and so zing I'm

154
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,899
being I'm big data without doing

155
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:00,749
anything and and as so you do run it or

156
00:07:00,749 --> 00:07:02,339
sometimes with a minor change on the

157
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:03,719
front end or you know something like

158
00:07:03,719 --> 00:07:06,360
that it's for marketing purposes but

159
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,610
it's not big data and because a lot of

160
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:09,509
people don't know what big data is

161
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:12,770
especially at the c-level executive area

162
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:16,319
they say okay we're big data now and so

163
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,610
they're not lying when they say they're

164
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,219
big data they don't know so the problem

165
00:07:20,219 --> 00:07:23,789
is that businesses generate terabytes of

166
00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:27,300
data but it's not just that the analysis

167
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,759
burden that we're doing increases right

168
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,879
because have you ever known a PCI DSS to

169
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:36,629
remove requirements right i mean so they

170
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:37,889
don't say okay you don't need to do that

171
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:39,689
anymore that was that was five years ago

172
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:42,029
they don't say that so they all they do

173
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:46,080
is add HIPAA just adds the the Sox just

174
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,529
add your own systems tend to grow you

175
00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:52,469
have controls that you're adding on to

176
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:57,209
them right so though we did have you

177
00:07:57,209 --> 00:07:58,769
know 200 controls that you had to verify

178
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:01,439
last quarter now we have 300 this

179
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,399
quarter okay so so the result is that we

180
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:08,459
have increasing notifications that I'm

181
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:10,649
going to bring up an old problem with it

182
00:08:10,649 --> 00:08:12,930
with a different lens do you increase

183
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:16,110
your staff size when this happens and a

184
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,550
lot of you raise your hands when you're

185
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,080
hiring security people by the way I

186
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,459
might want to talk to you I got some

187
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:26,069
students but to be the be a lot of times

188
00:08:26,069 --> 00:08:27,479
the security staff is not increased a

189
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:28,649
lot of times that's because we can't

190
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:30,930
find anyone and I'm going to bring up

191
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,309
that problem at the end of the

192
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:37,250
presentation on why that is so the SC IM

193
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:42,299
siem systems are overloaded I i saw i

194
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:44,670
had this SE IM all the way through my

195
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:48,420
presentation and then i started doing

196
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,920
some research on some products and

197
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,870
everyone called it siem and then I

198
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,310
switched it and then I just found some

199
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:53,990
research and so by

200
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:57,529
products at SC I am so this see more sim

201
00:08:57,529 --> 00:09:01,010
but be the sim the sim systems are

202
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:03,620
overloaded so let's talk about target

203
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,390
because we're all familiar with it by

204
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:09,080
now okay so target this these quotes

205
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,029
were from a Molly Snyder so these were

206
00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:16,339
Tamia she is not an information security

207
00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:19,370
she's more of a spokesman marketing role

208
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:22,760
but but they were amazing first off that

209
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,980
she knew this and that and that she

210
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,560
actually said it so they said there are

211
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,110
vast number of technical events so a lot

212
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,510
of us are in this problem there are a

213
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:36,589
ton of events that are triggered by our

214
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:41,540
software okay so and then what do we do

215
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,450
we don't have enough staff track all the

216
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,589
events but we triage because we need to

217
00:09:47,589 --> 00:09:50,899
write so we triage the events um these

218
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:52,940
ones look really important these ones I

219
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,440
need to look at at some point and these

220
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,080
ones i'm going to throw away ok so we

221
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,970
triage all the events because there's

222
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,760
too many events from our from our

223
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,829
intrusion detection software our ideas

224
00:10:03,829 --> 00:10:07,579
are seeing software and uh so target

225
00:10:07,579 --> 00:10:10,760
actually had a pretty robust system they

226
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,890
really invested a lot of money into it

227
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:18,260
um and were i recently certified as PCI

228
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,810
compliance some of you know that the PCI

229
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:23,959
compliance can be revoked by bc i retro

230
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:26,420
actively so they could say when you get

231
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,430
hacked oh you're not pci complaint even

232
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:31,970
though we said you were and so but but i

233
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,250
don't think pc i did that's a target yet

234
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,970
they did it to TJ maxx and where they

235
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,770
just said you pretty much lied to us so

236
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,329
you were never piece i can play and then

237
00:10:41,329 --> 00:10:44,060
they can retro actively find you so it

238
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,370
does get into a problem now fire i was

239
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:48,550
allegedly installed from what i've read

240
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:53,450
fire I refuses to confirm or deny their

241
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,279
client list which is probably good for

242
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,190
fire i right and I'm going to say if

243
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,930
they were installed whatever was it's

244
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:01,490
the whole dark side or fire I or

245
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:04,820
whatever they did a good job they

246
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,820
actually caught these here

247
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:11,020
put out incidents five of them on

248
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,160
November 30th when they attacked first

249
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,500
happened multiple ones I i could get a

250
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,740
number on December second and and so

251
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,290
they actually had these and they were

252
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:23,720
investigated by target employees but the

253
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,390
target employees were worked too much

254
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:30,020
data okay so so they had a too much data

255
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,420
so this is where I say this is maybe a

256
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,190
big data problem but it's definitely not

257
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:37,940
big data it is people being overwhelmed

258
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:41,180
with lots of data without a good way to

259
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:44,330
to answer the problem of what do you do

260
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:47,240
and so the auto delete was turned off

261
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,800
which most of us do and that's

262
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,050
reasonable right because we don't want

263
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:52,670
to say to the software oh yeah delete

264
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,740
those files that you detect there are a

265
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:58,160
lot of false positives you would rather

266
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,910
have the software detect everything then

267
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,830
miss Addie text and then as a result you

268
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:07,760
you you move the software towards over

269
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,290
detection the software companies do this

270
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:12,640
themselves towards over detection and

271
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,400
and so that you get a lot of things that

272
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,240
are reported as as incidents that aren't

273
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,580
incidental or aren't severe incidents

274
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:26,590
and and that's what happened here so I

275
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:30,170
bring this up because if the target

276
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:32,450
employees were sitting around doing

277
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:35,570
nothing and incidents all of a sudden

278
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:38,180
popped up then they'd be like oh we got

279
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,410
to investigate these we haven't since

280
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:40,700
that's not what happened they were

281
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,150
running around every day investigating

282
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:46,910
hundreds of incidents right so so and

283
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:49,760
and some of you might be in that

284
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,470
situation right now where you're

285
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,530
investigating incidents all the time you

286
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:56,420
you only can work a person 40 hours a

287
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,280
week they won't let you work them more

288
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,480
than that I mean you could say you have

289
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,920
to work 50 this week or something but

290
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,400
pretty much only 40 hours a week and so

291
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,560
they only have so much time to do what

292
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,380
they need to do to investigate these so

293
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:13,760
you're burdened by this and and so be

294
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,860
the they had too many alerts to

295
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,080
investigate they triaged and put things

296
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,630
in a priority and the

297
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:24,870
Eastern European western Russia acts

298
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:29,220
that that came in when I'm not

299
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,410
undetected but unresolved now when you

300
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:34,140
read the popular press even in the

301
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:37,950
security journals they say the system

302
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,060
that target had a fire I system I think

303
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:45,900
was was a was ignored and target ignored

304
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,150
it and I'm like that's not quite the

305
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:50,430
story right so that's why i say Target

306
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,730
employees did a good job they just

307
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:55,080
probably were overworked and probably

308
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,780
had to treat out of necessity but they

309
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,310
didn't ignore it they weren't sitting at

310
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:01,380
their desk oh and other incident forget

311
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,910
about it I'm taking a long lunch they

312
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,700
weren't doing that they investigated

313
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,580
what they could when they could and and

314
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,850
because this was a zero-day attack they

315
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,010
couldn't do what they needed to do on

316
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:16,950
this it wasn't flagged as in as

317
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,470
important as it should have been okay so

318
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:22,470
what happened and this is where we're

319
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,630
starting starting to get some changes

320
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,240
not enough but will we're starting to

321
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,300
get some changes the CEO did come out

322
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,880
and say some pretty weird stuff I don't

323
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,950
think the CEO lied I thought target

324
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,060
actually handled the situation pretty

325
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,740
good buddy he said some pretty weird

326
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,350
stuff that wasn't was mistaken wasn't

327
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,340
true it like I said I don't think he

328
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:45,540
lied and he ended up being resigned and

329
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:50,180
so did the CIO now a lot of our CIOs are

330
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,730
not security specialists right I mean

331
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:56,280
because you fit a technology doesn't

332
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,230
make you a security specialist we did

333
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,270
you do the choir I think on that one but

334
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,800
you're not a security specialist of your

335
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,600
CIO you're responsible for a lot of

336
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,970
things CIOs fired CEO was fired in

337
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:09,240
people backed up a little bit that and

338
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,170
the OPM hack where Archuleta got

339
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:14,850
resigned forced to resign their heavy

340
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:19,820
pressure right where they pop secret

341
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,080
applications were leaked to we think

342
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:27,000
China that sort of thing is is I making

343
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,790
CEOs and c-level executives stand up and

344
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:32,100
say wait we need to do something about

345
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,420
this I could be fired so

346
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,310
we did it so this actually there's a

347
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:39,890
silver lining here because it used to be

348
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:43,460
security was okay you security people go

349
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,920
into your corner do the security thing

350
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,490
and leave us alone and then they once

351
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,740
every six months pull in the ciso and

352
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:54,290
say you know okay we got hacked we

353
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:56,180
trusted you and you didn't you know you

354
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,500
didn't resolve the situation you're

355
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,720
fired bring me the next person in line

356
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,650
and will make them cisf or hire outside

357
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:04,610
to the point where they're even jokes

358
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:06,920
about ciso standing for career is soon

359
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,280
over so this this was the problem but

360
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,910
now that the and now that the CEO is on

361
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:16,220
the line they're starting to get bored

362
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:20,090
room reports they're starting to get a

363
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:23,950
little more interest in the topic and

364
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:27,770
this bottom quote was something that

365
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:29,480
we're going to address when I say

366
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,490
starting to I really mean starting to a

367
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,660
lot of companies haven't done it yet

368
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,240
there's a reluctance there still is but

369
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,170
not a target to tie data breaches to the

370
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:41,990
bottom line so in other words you

371
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:46,580
security people are an expense and and

372
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:49,070
you don't help my revenue at all a

373
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:51,230
cheaper we can do it the better off we

374
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:53,720
are and they're starting to say that

375
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,030
might not be a good way to look like I

376
00:16:56,030 --> 00:17:02,480
said starting to data not uh not not

377
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,800
done so I make the point that we are all

378
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,960
target here because we all have

379
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:15,220
overflowing Incident Response reports mr

380
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:18,920
siem software that we have to respond to

381
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,950
and we don't have a lot of times the

382
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:25,060
manpower that we all have to triage and

383
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,770
when we triage there is a chance

384
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:31,400
especially on a zero-day attack there's

385
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,830
a chance that a zero-day attack gets

386
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:38,030
moved to a lower importance level ok so

387
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:41,660
so that's where we're at and so and so

388
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:45,590
uh that's that's one of those uh

389
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,940
if you look at target i was looking at

390
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,640
target and saying what can what could

391
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,779
have they done and to tell you the truth

392
00:17:52,779 --> 00:17:56,710
even now I'm hoping that the big data a

393
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:59,360
solution is a solution I think it is but

394
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,380
but the the problem that we're having is

395
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:07,100
that target if it happened today where

396
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,720
they had another zero-day attack what

397
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,539
would they do and they would try to

398
00:18:11,539 --> 00:18:13,279
triage it and see how important it is

399
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:14,720
and then move it I mean what would they

400
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,659
do differently so we fire the people but

401
00:18:17,659 --> 00:18:21,679
we don't change what we do look at OPM

402
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,690
if I pick on them a little more they

403
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:26,480
fired the director of the Office of

404
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,710
Personnel Management for the US

405
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:31,399
government and they replaced her and she

406
00:18:31,399 --> 00:18:34,090
came out and said okay we're now doing

407
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:37,250
two-factor authentication get into our

408
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,020
systems and I'm like that's great that's

409
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,880
good two factors always better than one

410
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,870
factor but that doesn't stop what taina

411
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:47,270
did d I mean you know that doesn't stop

412
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:49,399
anything that and so my guess is she's

413
00:18:49,399 --> 00:18:50,570
saying that because Congress is saying

414
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:51,620
what are you doing it she says

415
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:55,480
two-factor authentication and they go um

416
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,059
okay great I don't want to say I don't

417
00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:01,070
know what that is and how it relates but

418
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:04,580
yes i was i was listening to to the

419
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,309
report and saying they fired the person

420
00:19:07,309 --> 00:19:09,799
who found here now granted there was

421
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:12,860
some did but it was a they had Einstein

422
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,169
installed and Einstein claim they found

423
00:19:15,169 --> 00:19:16,460
it and later they came out with someone

424
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:19,789
else found it but whatever found on or

425
00:19:19,789 --> 00:19:22,340
watch and they hired her it brought

426
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:25,039
someone new in without changing what

427
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,850
they did okay and so that's the problem

428
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,799
that I'm having so will the same thing

429
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:35,480
happen again well maybe you know okay so

430
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,520
now let's go into what is big data in

431
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,980
big data analysis a lot of times I use

432
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:43,000
data analytics analytics and big data

433
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,289
interchangeably someone might might be

434
00:19:47,289 --> 00:19:49,940
the big data specialist might want to

435
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,230
come out to me afterwards and going you

436
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:53,330
can't use those interchange like so but

437
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:54,830
that's I do use it occasionally because

438
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:58,220
I I look at this as a big data and data

439
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:58,570
and

440
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:01,570
has the same thing okay so we work with

441
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:05,320
huge data sets but the goal of big data

442
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,169
analysis is not that you work with them

443
00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:11,399
but to find out things you didn't know

444
00:20:11,399 --> 00:20:15,580
that you didn't know to ask about so if

445
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:18,460
you were a security specialist and you

446
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,529
know enough to ask about something it's

447
00:20:20,529 --> 00:20:22,600
not a zero-day vulnerability anymore

448
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,090
it's probably a two-week vulnerability

449
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,559
right I mean by the time you know enough

450
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,990
to say hey are we protected against this

451
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:31,929
it's too late you know so so that's

452
00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:37,330
that's the problem the the way you do

453
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:41,230
this is is really statistics on on

454
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:44,950
steroids so how many of us have taken a

455
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:48,309
regression in the last new years you

456
00:20:48,309 --> 00:20:49,659
know and that's a rhetorical question

457
00:20:49,659 --> 00:20:52,659
you it but you know if you have never

458
00:20:52,659 --> 00:20:54,909
taken a regression in your life it

459
00:20:54,909 --> 00:20:57,970
really can't do Big Data this that

460
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:00,490
that's that low bar of the entry point

461
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,799
if you look at some of the neural

462
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:07,120
network approaches some of the idea that

463
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,029
people are typing things in and it's not

464
00:21:10,029 --> 00:21:13,720
in your database so the big data

465
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,450
specialists really take and by the way I

466
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:19,419
don't I don't care I i teach it and i do

467
00:21:19,419 --> 00:21:21,309
count myself as a very knowledgeable in

468
00:21:21,309 --> 00:21:24,519
the field but the ones who are do it for

469
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:27,909
a living really take their hackles rise

470
00:21:27,909 --> 00:21:30,340
up a little bit when you say yeah we do

471
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,379
big data i have a database full of data

472
00:21:32,379 --> 00:21:36,129
because if it's in a database we're

473
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:37,840
pretty good at that let me go to tera

474
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,600
byte size databases already so the idea

475
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,210
from now is what if people type

476
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:45,700
something in what about log files what

477
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:49,509
about what about a length of time that

478
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:51,429
you're staying spending on a system what

479
00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:53,919
all these data sources that were we're

480
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,309
accessing now are not database data you

481
00:21:57,309 --> 00:22:00,399
can't do an SQL statement and retrieve

482
00:22:00,399 --> 00:22:02,379
them with a lot with as easy as you can

483
00:22:02,379 --> 00:22:04,769
with the database so so there's a lot of

484
00:22:04,769 --> 00:22:08,139
data coming out there the data is huge

485
00:22:08,139 --> 00:22:12,310
and analyze it

486
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,350
you know to make decisions on security

487
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:17,650
or retail or or whatever it takes more

488
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:19,990
than just than just accessing the

489
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:22,150
database and and doing an order by on

490
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,700
your select statement okay so so that's

491
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,980
the that's the point we're making here

492
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:29,470
that you still need to know SQL you

493
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:33,400
still need to know some development but

494
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,870
you probably need to know a lot of

495
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:36,640
statistics or be able to use a stats

496
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,040
package you've got to be ready for

497
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,480
things that are not in a normal

498
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,220
distribution you've got to be you know

499
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,780
how do you how do you adjust that and

500
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,630
and so things like that complexity of

501
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:51,460
the data is way larger than it used to

502
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,720
be again go back to the target hack a

503
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,120
flat file stored on the system I think

504
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,220
in an area not mapped by the file

505
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:03,100
allocation table where a ram scraper was

506
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,070
used to populate this that was installed

507
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:10,450
on the cash registers and then and then

508
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:16,560
a leaked out slowly into another another

509
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:20,560
server in Eastern Europe picked up

510
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:24,520
slowly so we didn't have the problems

511
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,870
that we had before but that we have

512
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:29,020
before so if you look at your IDs system

513
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,160
right now your intrusion detection

514
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:34,030
system right now they typically have and

515
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,710
by the way not a bad idea but they

516
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:40,600
typically have a baseline where they

517
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,550
measure what your network traffic should

518
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:45,580
be and if your network traffic seeds

519
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:48,010
that baseline by a ninety-five percent

520
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,590
probability right that if you're given

521
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:52,840
this baseline and our average everyday

522
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,040
and all of a sudden you got something

523
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,980
way over here way under way over here

524
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:01,660
you end up with a an alert saying our

525
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:04,900
network traffic's to buck too high so a

526
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,410
lot of these packages try to keep under

527
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:11,530
that radar and and so that's that's what

528
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:12,880
they're doing so to what we're doing

529
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,530
this statistical analysis that they're

530
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:18,220
doing is a just a confidence interval

531
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,900
right and they choose the compn center

532
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,810
and they say seems unlikely that the

533
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:23,980
network traffic which should be this

534
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,310
high so if I want to grab data

535
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:30,080
from you I take it at in smaller chunks

536
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,640
right that's the whole that's the game

537
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,050
and that's what they did at target I

538
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:36,030
think no one from target called me by

539
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,620
the way it tried to get as much

540
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,630
information i can just researching it

541
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:42,090
but you know that's so so but no one

542
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:44,880
going called me on this but anyway so so

543
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,100
the idea is you have this decision

544
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:52,110
software and then you have to convey

545
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:56,910
this complex and sometimes very hard to

546
00:24:56,910 --> 00:25:01,020
understand analysis to decision makers

547
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,870
in normal big data analysis those

548
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,700
decision makers are the marketing

549
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,460
department the CEO in your case it would

550
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,590
be this incident response that we're

551
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,560
doing this at these high level

552
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,960
mathematical functions on a lot of times

553
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,600
technical functions too they convey this

554
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,790
to you in a way you can understand it

555
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:23,850
and act quickly on there so there's the

556
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:28,530
key okay so so and so we do how big is

557
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:32,070
big those records horses I and I grabbed

558
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:36,140
this from a normal data analytics slide

559
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:39,930
but for you guys I I know that I've seen

560
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:46,200
the the search print presenters before a

561
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,050
couple of weeks ago what they were

562
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:51,030
talking about that we know right before

563
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:52,710
me they were talking about some of the

564
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:56,430
cert tools that they use to grab data

565
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,920
and we end up with tons of data right

566
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:02,220
every time anyone gets data from you we

567
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,380
record their IP address you record the

568
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,600
length of time of their session we

569
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,700
record what port they were accessing and

570
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:13,670
in and you know we have literally

571
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:16,980
hundreds of thousands of hits sometimes

572
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:20,280
per hour so you end up with a large data

573
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,940
set and you recognize the pattern so

574
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:27,720
this is the key big data right here can

575
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,160
you recognize the patterns and for

576
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,190
information security can you recognize

577
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,660
the patterns that you don't know enough

578
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:37,520
to ask about the zero-day vulnerability

579
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,000
ok so you don't know enough to ask about

580
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,060
alright so so the old way and this is

581
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,280
what I try to bring up old versus new

582
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,010
and this is from me not from anywhere I

583
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:51,370
I picked up so this is this is how would

584
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:53,410
we do things differently how do you stop

585
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:55,870
target and so the always signature

586
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:58,450
recognition check your server file some

587
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,850
file existed checksum with the five

588
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:03,100
certain files probably not all of them

589
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,530
but some of them what files do you have

590
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:07,660
on your system what are their dates what

591
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,820
are the file sizes what's it run a check

592
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,410
some to see if their change network

593
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:13,690
traffic IP addresses on the network

594
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:15,340
traffic length of time of sessions

595
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,870
things like that list of bad websites

596
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,910
have any websites are people going on

597
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:20,440
internally that they shouldn't be going

598
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,390
on you know to see if anyone's

599
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,640
internally a bad actor and Bennett

600
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,260
leaked data from your company and so

601
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:28,900
that that's the old way and by the way

602
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,420
you still need to do this okay so this

603
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,400
is not when I say old versus new I

604
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,590
really mean they don't stop doing that

605
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:39,070
old way but you might need to add to it

606
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:42,040
the new way unknown patterns is zero-day

607
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,460
vulnerabilities detected new methods of

608
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:49,570
hacking stopped again if if if some

609
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:52,180
someone comes up with something new that

610
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:54,090
you stop it without knowing what it is

611
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:57,450
first and then different techniques

612
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:59,590
logistical analysis artificial

613
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:00,940
intelligence expert systems neural

614
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:04,080
networks things like that which are

615
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,060
which require a skill set that you might

616
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,610
not have in your information security

617
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:12,700
area or in your entire IT area right so

618
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,730
the skill set that you need might not be

619
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:18,490
there um and you might need to you find

620
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:21,400
a way to get that um so that's that's

621
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,310
what I'm doing now let's talk about what

622
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:27,450
I would I would i look at as some of the

623
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,410
there are some people doing big data

624
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:33,130
analysis and am big data using big data

625
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:37,450
tool doing a real good job but i divide

626
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:39,700
it and i'm not i actually took we're

627
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,490
betting don't remember where i divide

628
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:46,140
the big day big data and data analytics

629
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:49,630
into three areas where you have a

630
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:52,240
visualization decision support and

631
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,860
information discover

632
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,530
so those three areas so the information

633
00:28:56,530 --> 00:29:02,830
discovery would be the idea that we have

634
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:06,940
this information what are things that we

635
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:09,130
didn't know before about this

636
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:11,940
information then the decision support is

637
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:16,830
if I had a thousand of you and I gave

638
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:20,740
information to all thousand what would

639
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:25,840
you do on all thousand cases so in other

640
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,000
words you don't have the time so there's

641
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,250
software their expert systems that mimic

642
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:34,679
what you would do report this and then

643
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:37,720
visualization is this idea that once we

644
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,030
decide something is questionable we

645
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,380
decide something is definitely a threat

646
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:44,860
we turn it off right and that's a lot of

647
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,929
you are unwilling to do that and I am

648
00:29:46,929 --> 00:29:49,450
unwilling to do that as well but we need

649
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:50,679
to get to the point where we are willing

650
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:55,179
to do this we talked to a previous to

651
00:29:55,179 --> 00:29:58,179
two sessions all brought up that we're

652
00:29:58,179 --> 00:29:59,500
gonna have to automate some things right

653
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,510
now I know that there's questions on

654
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,549
what you can automate him can't automate

655
00:30:03,549 --> 00:30:06,790
but we have to we can't be there all the

656
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:08,770
time we have to automate some things you

657
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:10,690
have the things that are not a threat

658
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:12,700
because you would look at them and you

659
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,350
would analyze them yourself and say

660
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,880
they're not a threat and then things

661
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,230
that are a threat you've seen it before

662
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:19,660
there you know or yeah it's doing some

663
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,890
really weird things shut it down right

664
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:24,270
now and what you would do right and then

665
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:27,580
things that we don't know and those are

666
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:30,640
things that the visualization reports to

667
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,380
you so you can make a quick decision now

668
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:39,010
the problem we have going with the big

669
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:41,830
data spray that I talked about is that

670
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:45,900
the visualization we are really good at

671
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,880
okay so so we used to get reports and we

672
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,320
still get reports but we used to get

673
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,299
reports that were the previous night's

674
00:30:52,299 --> 00:30:54,700
activities and we would read the reports

675
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,400
and even a checklist on paper or

676
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,840
sometimes on the screen and we'd go

677
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,610
through the checklist and fix what we

678
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:04,090
need to fix okay and and that's gotten a

679
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:04,530
lot but

680
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:05,940
there are a lot of tools out there that

681
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:09,660
say we're big data and what they mean is

682
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:14,460
that they are visualization is that bad

683
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,800
and the answer is it's not bad to have

684
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,990
visualization it allows you to look at a

685
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:22,380
bunch of data and I'm more compressed or

686
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,170
mad instantaneously and make decisions

687
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:28,020
right away so visualization is not bad

688
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,320
it's just that that's all they're doing

689
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,370
but that's all they're doing right now

690
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:34,650
and and so there are some other

691
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:37,860
companies but but the visualization part

692
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:41,010
is is the problem in my in my opinion

693
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:44,070
that when you say your big data and you

694
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,630
come up with visualization and you don't

695
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:49,170
have discovery or decision support then

696
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:52,320
you run into problems now I highlighted

697
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,170
some things on on a decision support and

698
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:59,990
information discovery some of us are are

699
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:02,760
pretty good at sequel server already an

700
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,410
ad hoc queries and things like that a

701
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:08,400
lot of us can do us SQL statement you

702
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,000
know you know without much problem be

703
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,250
the OLAP might be a little bit different

704
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:17,670
but it still is a database issue right

705
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:20,190
where instead of having relational

706
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:22,380
databases where data is related to other

707
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:25,140
data you relate every single bit of data

708
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:28,170
to every other single bit of data into

709
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:30,240
what's called a cube and then you find

710
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,540
the relationships that are kind of

711
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:36,390
outside the normal bounds so you know

712
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:39,060
our long connections typical in your

713
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,950
company yes they are a long connections

714
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:42,720
in California at two in the afternoon

715
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,630
typical Evan and that's where they say

716
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,660
hey this is weird we don't normally have

717
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:51,420
this you know whereas you the manager

718
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,340
wouldn't say well yeah we have long

719
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,990
connections I can't say every time

720
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:56,700
someone has a session that last 20

721
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,310
minutes you know but California two

722
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,280
o'clock long session we're you know so

723
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,520
it flies under the radar most IDs but

724
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,730
the big data analysis the OLAP the idea

725
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:09,960
that you find relationships that don't

726
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,060
exist but pop it up and say you never

727
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:14,960
had this before then you say oh wait

728
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,050
there's a

729
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:22,340
a nation state that is trying to get the

730
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:25,700
data and pull it in okay and so and then

731
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,020
the other two things I wanted to bring

732
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:30,380
up we're well throw other things so we

733
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,940
understand that data mining neural

734
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:34,400
networks if you're not using those a lot

735
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,020
of times the neural network finds

736
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,880
relationships but doesn't tell you why I

737
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,340
always use the example that the

738
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:42,260
population of sperm whales in the ocean

739
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:44,780
versus a stock market right the

740
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,940
population sperm whales is negatively

741
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:50,150
correlated but not rude there's no

742
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:53,000
causation there right so so a lot of

743
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,860
times no networks come up with spurious

744
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,320
relationships the statistics though is

745
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,270
important that if you're doing this on

746
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:02,120
your own you have statistics that you'd

747
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,000
have to employ and usually you can't

748
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,850
just you know do an average you have to

749
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:10,399
do more high-powered statistics and that

750
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,199
takes a skill set that a lot of us don't

751
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:14,629
have the artificial intelligence and

752
00:34:14,629 --> 00:34:16,340
expert systems are important this the

753
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,649
idea that you map what the rules you are

754
00:34:18,649 --> 00:34:20,659
using in your head into the software so

755
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:24,320
you can have many use running around on

756
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,090
your software and do exactly what you

757
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:27,168
would do they don't have to be

758
00:34:27,168 --> 00:34:28,610
intelligent even though it's called

759
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:30,110
artificial intelligence they don't have

760
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,399
to be smart they just have to do exactly

761
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:34,100
what you would do and then the second

762
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,719
thing and actually be the third thing is

763
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:37,879
a customized software you might need to

764
00:34:37,879 --> 00:34:40,940
develop some customized software ok so i

765
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:43,219
bring this up that we do a very good job

766
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:45,230
of visualization okay on distances

767
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:47,060
poured some of the time and information

768
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:49,010
discovery a lot of times we leave that

769
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:51,590
completely out on big data packages so a

770
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,929
lot of times people say we're big data

771
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:55,070
and we have a big data package and

772
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:58,100
you'll say what are you the tableau and

773
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,050
click sense and things like that are

774
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:02,270
very good at visualization they expect

775
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:04,160
you to provide the back end you'll make

776
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,590
bad decisions if you're if you don't do

777
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:08,740
that so Google came up with this idea of

778
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:11,030
MapReduce where you take a database and

779
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:15,860
reduce information okay and and this is

780
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:18,080
the idea and they give the example where

781
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,460
we're trying to find stuff about John

782
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,710
and put it into a database so we have

783
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:24,080
this unstructured data the MapReduce

784
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,960
takes how patterns in the data reduces

785
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,930
it into a database and ends up with the

786
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:32,070
result there's

787
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:34,230
a package called head doom it's

788
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:37,980
java-based that that uses this it looks

789
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,020
kind of like a zombie attack right

790
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,910
except in this case you're doing your

791
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:45,270
own zombies and the the idea here is

792
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:46,710
that you have all this data and there's

793
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:51,090
no way a a server a computer one can run

794
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:54,240
through it so you end up with these

795
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,960
slave computers data nodes that you say

796
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,760
you do this part you do this part you do

797
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,290
this part it's distributed computing and

798
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:04,620
you have to you have to a like a zombie

799
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,270
attack is right when you get attacked by

800
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:09,540
a I'm being thing and and then the data

801
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,340
ends up in a database this is very

802
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:14,400
intensive and technologically expensive

803
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,200
come up somewhat so you need someone to

804
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:20,100
manage this and and it is Java code that

805
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,870
a good Java programmer should have no

806
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:25,560
problem with this but that Hadoop file

807
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,320
system that's the tough part so setting

808
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,750
up Hadoop is real tough after you get a

809
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,670
set up it's I'm not saying any

810
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:33,990
programming it's got its issues right

811
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:35,370
but then after you get it set up there's

812
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:38,570
Java libraries that Hadoop provides um

813
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:42,930
Splunk is a bender here and i try to i'm

814
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:45,390
trying to bring up splint because they

815
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:47,850
are the log file king although if you

816
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:49,290
tell them that they say hey we do other

817
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,870
things but and they do but the they

818
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,940
analyze all your log files which are

819
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,740
pretty much unstructured data they're

820
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:58,430
not in your database registry entries

821
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:00,720
database logs things like that

822
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,360
configurations and they put it all

823
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:07,400
together where the customer data the

824
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:11,010
outside the data center data the RFID

825
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:13,350
the blogs things like that the Lord's

826
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:15,450
that the taking the carapace tickets

827
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:16,800
that you're that you're putting out

828
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,090
things like that those they analyze all

829
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:25,320
this and and they put it into a bundle

830
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,810
of server that where they actually take

831
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:29,370
the data and make it accessible with a

832
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:33,210
rest or soap interface this is where I

833
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:35,100
said do I put rest or soap in here and I

834
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,140
thought I'd be boring so I want to read

835
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,920
about resting so go Google but the be

836
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,380
rested soap interface xml output comes

837
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,270
back and

838
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:47,760
it's a allows you to do alerts and

839
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,850
things like that they do have tools like

840
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:52,050
this tool right here it says what's

841
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:54,140
running in what programs are running and

842
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:57,270
what do they put out what data do they

843
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:59,340
put out so they do have tools on splunk

844
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:05,040
I know that Barclays was using I think

845
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,790
fire I again but and and other SIEM said

846
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:12,690
anthea the person in charge of this came

847
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:15,870
out as a evangelist for splunk had said

848
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:18,270
we are actually replacing fire I which I

849
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:19,710
don't recommend by the way we are

850
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:23,730
replacing fire I because they trained be

851
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:27,840
the splunk system because neural

852
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,850
networks and big data has to have to be

853
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:32,910
trained to recognize things situations

854
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:35,820
that are bad that they trained it using

855
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,910
the fire I output with the eventual hope

856
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:46,460
to to remove why according to the

857
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:49,320
Barclay executive that was doing this he

858
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,710
eventually took a job with splunk and

859
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:54,570
left Barclay so I always go wait a

860
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:56,910
second to those talks come before or

861
00:38:56,910 --> 00:39:00,180
after you started in an eventual 'used

862
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,430
so take it with a grain of salt but he

863
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:06,860
seemed to be very very a pro pro pro a

864
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:09,090
Splunk there are others that say that

865
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:11,970
their Incident Response went down to 20

866
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:15,150
seconds per event on average rather than

867
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:17,370
two minutes is what they had before that

868
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:20,340
was WordPress now this is going to be

869
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:23,100
probably the last slide but this is

870
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,390
probably the one that you all care about

871
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:27,390
how much money are we making two days

872
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:30,960
ago I went on to indeed.com and said how

873
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,140
much are all these jobs paid okay and

874
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,910
I'd search for information security and

875
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:38,550
big data now I did some similar things

876
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:43,200
with impose etiquette and cissp and data

877
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,760
analytics and things like that it got

878
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,660
similar results the blue section is 22

879
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:51,150
55,000 notice there is no blue section

880
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:54,030
on big data this is these are full-time

881
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:56,850
jobs that are paying 20 to 55,000 so the

882
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:58,920
lowest paid was 20,000 I think

883
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,839
got the lowest i could find on big data

884
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:04,230
was sixty five thousand dollars a year

885
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:07,470
and so the problem with implementing big

886
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:09,990
data is a lot of executives look at data

887
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:12,900
analytics as helps revenue not in

888
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,059
security but but in you know when we're

889
00:40:15,059 --> 00:40:16,290
trying to do it and they look at

890
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:19,020
information security as it's an expense

891
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,119
like i was saying before like target did

892
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,089
and they haven't changed as of two days

893
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:27,450
ago so they they still are saying they

894
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:29,130
said that you don't get the the brown

895
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:30,900
section is the highest paid the hundred

896
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,970
thousand plus you get half a big data

897
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:35,190
jobs are a hundred thousand plus you

898
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:37,079
know less than a quarter of information

899
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:39,510
security are and so they say there's an

900
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:41,760
information security shortage and the

901
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,990
reason for that is they're not willing

902
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:45,119
to pay people to take up the skill set

903
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:47,670
and it's kind of a risky job you get

904
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:49,230
hacked if I'm a developer you're not

905
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:50,220
going to acquire me you're just going to

906
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,140
say hey develop faster but if I get

907
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:55,049
hacked you might fire so so it's so

908
00:40:55,049 --> 00:40:57,270
that's the problem that we're having to

909
00:40:57,270 --> 00:41:00,030
implement this executives need to change

910
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:01,890
their mindset so you guys go tell your

911
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:05,309
executives to change come on set and and

912
00:41:05,309 --> 00:41:07,559
see what happens but the but that's

913
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:09,240
that's what they that's the problem that

914
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:12,089
we have and again IT security taiyo

915
00:41:12,089 --> 00:41:15,059
expenses and and information security I

916
00:41:15,059 --> 00:41:16,740
mean every security tightens butt and

917
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:22,619
big data tied to the revenues a lot of

918
00:41:22,619 --> 00:41:26,130
the time and and so expertise in big

919
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:29,490
data is harder to come by okay and so

920
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:34,589
I'm the idea here is if you can't afford

921
00:41:34,589 --> 00:41:36,710
it there are other companies that are

922
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:38,760
incorporating big data in their

923
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,220
solutions make it doing the learning

924
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:43,799
process on their servers and sending you

925
00:41:43,799 --> 00:41:45,809
the finished product and I lifted a

926
00:41:45,809 --> 00:41:48,660
couple of IBM also has one I didn't if I

927
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,400
left your company hops sorry there are

928
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,809
some other companies that say they're

929
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:53,940
doing them telligence big data data

930
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:56,099
analytics and when I look at it I can't

931
00:41:56,099 --> 00:41:57,450
find any that they're actually doing

932
00:41:57,450 --> 00:41:59,849
they they they say they are but I

933
00:41:59,849 --> 00:42:02,040
couldn't mind it but these I know

934
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,869
silence has a ninety-nine percent

935
00:42:03,869 --> 00:42:05,700
detection rate according to them of

936
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,980
zero-day vulnerabilities that when they

937
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:10,140
get a zero day of vulnerability and then

938
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:12,240
they just turn it off they don't let you

939
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:12,630
run it

940
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,910
so that seems to be a very good uh good

941
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:16,590
way to do it so if you can't afford it

942
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:19,140
or you know then try to look for someone

943
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,340
who will do it for you and send you

944
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:23,550
updates on your and you'll get the

945
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:25,980
database nice structured data from them

946
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:28,500
and they'll deal with all the messiness

947
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,750
of the big data okay and i think that's

948
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:36,960
it are there any questions okay well

949
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,600
then I guess it is approaching lunchtime

950
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:43,730
so so anyway take care guys
