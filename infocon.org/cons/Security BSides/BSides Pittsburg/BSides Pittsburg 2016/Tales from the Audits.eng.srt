1
00:00:01,389 --> 00:00:04,460
I'm Andy our next talk is tells from the

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:08,600
audit and we are guarding now so here's

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:14,360
Justin oh yes this is obviously the most

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,779
popular talk of the day right so I want

5
00:00:17,779 --> 00:00:19,039
to do something a little bit loose a

6
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,470
little bit you know something I'm not as

7
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:22,669
a common thing you know when I was

8
00:00:22,669 --> 00:00:23,960
thinking about actually submitting for

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,869
b-sides nobody wants to hear kind of the

10
00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:28,820
governance risk compliance which is kind

11
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,890
of my field of expertise but the thing

12
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:32,689
that I collect a lot of the times is

13
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:35,930
these awesome stories from regulators

14
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:39,770
auditors customers whatever it is and

15
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:42,739
that's the shocking nature that you get

16
00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:44,090
from all these different people and

17
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:45,379
actually some of the people in the

18
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:46,879
audience will actually recognize some of

19
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,609
those stories and they're just gems so

20
00:00:49,609 --> 00:00:52,219
let's be very light you know and I'm

21
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,629
glad everybody drink a beer so it

22
00:00:53,629 --> 00:00:57,079
actually be more funny this time but a

23
00:00:57,079 --> 00:00:59,449
little bit about me I actually just

24
00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:03,589
broke back into the consulting thing was

25
00:01:03,589 --> 00:01:05,450
consultant went back into private

26
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:07,570
industry running security programs and

27
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:10,280
back into consulting work with Davie

28
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,440
County a lot of you guys obviously no

29
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,420
I'm and everything but we're basically

30
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,250
going to be focusing on a number of

31
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,500
different areas and I got stories on all

32
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,580
of them and it is just amazing some of

33
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,990
the things that people will say out of

34
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:28,310
this so first up regulators anybody deal

35
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:30,860
with financial regulators is mostly on

36
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,560
the FFIEC and some of the different

37
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,640
aspects don't you love them so my first

38
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,510
story do you monitor for so let's set

39
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,340
this up this is when I was actually

40
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,130
working at diebold and a tbell we were

41
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,810
labeled as one of the privileged

42
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,240
critical service providers that

43
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,460
basically means that we service a number

44
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:56,600
the financial industries and got the

45
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,030
privilege to get all the organizations

46
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:03,380
the OCC the FDIC NCUA all came to our

47
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,270
building for about month-long audit and

48
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,628
as we were going through this it so

49
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,818
happens that the FDIC was actually the

50
00:02:10,818 --> 00:02:14,510
lead examiner but everybody was there it

51
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:14,950
was really

52
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,080
funny of the elite examiner was a

53
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,680
spitting image a bill nye like seriously

54
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,340
bill nye Tootie except he had glasses

55
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,370
but he was more the ben Stein attitude

56
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,560
like the Bueller you know like no

57
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,800
personality did not get sarcasm at all

58
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,340
so we're coming back I was letting him

59
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,400
in the building after he went out to

60
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,739
lunch and he came back he's like hey

61
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:45,610
Dawson you know on the news I saw there

62
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:48,849
was a bunch of solar flares that were

63
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:51,580
acting up and they knew said that uh

64
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,140
they could actually interrupt some

65
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,540
communication I was like oh yeah I saw

66
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,160
that on the news when I was eating my

67
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,709
lunch and everything what does D will do

68
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:03,069
to monitor for solar flares and how do

69
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:06,640
you respond to that so literally like

70
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,370
we're saying the hallway I'm like oh man

71
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:13,030
like I started cracking up laughing I'm

72
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,790
like like a bastard operator from Hell

73
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,069
story you know like you know its solar

74
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:21,700

75
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,609
is me laughing and the you know the

76
00:03:24,609 --> 00:03:27,639

man like that's not that funny yeah and

78
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:33,609
then of course you say like this is one

79
00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:35,560
of the things that you should never say

80
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,590
to an examiner um that I say it's like

81
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:44,019
oh you're serious and then of course I'm

82
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:45,250
trying to collect myself from laughing

83
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,980

00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,840
to monitor for solar flares so I'm

86
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,850

is actually kind of funny we after the

98
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:25,060
solar flares happen we get a notice from

99
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,860
the FSI sack if you guys are familiar

100
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,370
with that we get an email no

101
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,110
it's like two days later after already

102
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,639
happen to like hey watch out for these

103
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,130
solar flares you know and everything

104
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:38,630
like very funny so next one need this in

105
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:42,320
your bcp so to set this up this was when

106
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,500
i was actually consultant we did a lot

107
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,540
of like auto assistance things of that

108
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:51,560
nature and this one credit union called

109
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,630
us up and said hey guys i really need

110
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:56,750
somebody to help us prepare or an NCUA

111
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,090
audit kind of guide us through and kind

112
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,650
of be the person kind of our point

113
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,800
person in front of the NCUA auditor so I

114
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,110
went out there literally it was a one

115
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,690
branch credit union 1 building in the

116
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:12,530
middle of a farm field in Ohio like as

117
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:15,110
little as capital ways you can actually

118
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:17,389
count this is what this credit union was

119
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:19,669
so going over like some of this stuff

120
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:23,539
from prior the previous examiner came in

121
00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:26,990
and said as I no service Lee airport

122
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,870
five miles away from your site you need

123
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:32,450
a specific response if a helicopter

124
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:36,860
crashes into your building and she's

125
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,050
like really like what are the chances

126
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:40,760
that know you if they already had one on

127
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,190
a fire they needed one if a helicopter

128
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,560
crashed into their building like that's

129
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,620
that's crazy he's like no that's not

130
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:51,139
even the best part do you like then he

131
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:54,080
required that if all the roads were shut

132
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,810
down you need to prove that you can get

133
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:59,150
into work like literally all the roads

134
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,250
were shut she physically and she showed

135
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,690
me the evidence of this had to take a

136
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:05,060
picture of a bicycle out of her garage

137
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,240
and prove to them that she had ways to

138
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,430
get into work if all the roads were shut

139
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:13,900
down live I she could have taken that

140
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,650
probably why they were worried about

141
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,680
actually crashing in the building right

142
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,639
like literally if the zombie apocalypse

143
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:22,039
happened she would have to make it into

144
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:24,380
work you know type of thing she honestly

145
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,660
said to me she's like this was the owner

146
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,810
of the cranium like if all the roads are

147
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:31,250
shut down I'm not coming in to work I'm

148
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:35,180
like I understand that yes so yeah it's

149
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,280
just it's amazing to me like some of the

150
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,200
regular and apologized any regularly and

151
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,630
the audience here but

152
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:45,170
they can kind of either kings of the

153
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,840
kingdom and even though they never ran

154
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,880
anything in the in their life and say

155
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,700
statistically you need a helicopter bcp

156
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,730
plan but yeah don't worry about that

157
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:58,930
fire one and have to have a bike so

158
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:03,290
customers this is one that's awesome you

159
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,570
know like we do a lot of different risk

160
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,340
assessments right now my current job and

161
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,220
when I was previously with a consulting

162
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:13,250
and sometimes you just got gems of

163
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,250
stories with that probably more side on

164
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,300
the pen testing but with this story here

165
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,670
you know are you looking for policies so

166
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:25,310
let's set this up basically we were

167
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:28,460
hired by the CFO of the company and they

168
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,440
had some offices at another different

169
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,330
location which is where their main IT

170
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:35,990
location was the CFO literally was

171
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,180
hiring us to audit their IT department

172
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,790
so already an adversarial type of thing

173
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:43,360
in fact I think he actually said that

174
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,730
the CIO was an ass and I'm hiring him to

175
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,260
do a risk assessment on them and all

176
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,720
that stuff so already bad news is start

177
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,730
off with got to be careful of that so

178
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,950
anyways we start the engagement and

179
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,500
going through my main contact his IT

180
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,840
manager we're going through one of the

181
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,310
sections obviously you know let me see

182
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,810
your policies procedures see how

183
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,240
thorough complete they are so II

184
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,350
literally hands me a user manual and

185
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,760
there's nothing in it about security

186
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,250
it's just you know really well some

187
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,950
ethics that's it nothing on technical

188
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:18,590
standards nothing on how to run your

189
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:21,950
security program at all and literally as

190
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:25,520
I'm like walking into his room seriously

191
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,170
this was like a hoarders commercial

192
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:30,980
edition you know that he had piles of

193
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,409
paper no doubt like off this table this

194
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:35,840
high all around is u-shaped us and all

195
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,929
over the floor and I don't know if you

196
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:42,320
guys ever did this but I'm like nobody

197
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,909
in the office is gonna believe me I'm

198
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:47,740
like checking email checking email snap

199
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:51,650
so literally I'm like yeah this is

200
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:55,130
awesome though we go through that not

201
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:57,110
a lot of policies and everything but I'm

202
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:00,140
meeting with the cio to discuss business

203
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,640
continuity planning so we're talking

204
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,230
about that what they're doing and

205
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,720
everything so at the end of our

206
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,840
conversation he's like Justin I saw one

207
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,420
of your sections is policies we have

208
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,820
some policies I'm like oh really because

209
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,340
we talk about it was only like a user

210
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,900
manual nothing really in it and

211
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,390
everything he's like no we got policies

212
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:23,630
he reaches into his desk drawer holds

213
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,580
how a folder hands it to me literally

214
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:28,820
this folder is labeled body you know and

215
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,130
I'm like all right this is gonna be

216
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,260
awesome you know type of thing so I

217
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,470
flipped through it and their litter that

218
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,910
awesome policy so it's like six pages

219
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,270
all content greatly like hitting on all

220
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:44,260
the topics and everything a problem is

221
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:46,640
like we got a conversation before I

222
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,060
realize he was an ex visa director or

223
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:53,030
something like that total copy like just

224
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,580
a fine and replace on this and I don't

225
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,790
really ask this question a lot but you

226
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,620
know once you get like oh yeah he's hand

227
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:03,650
me a folder with audit I have my doubts

228
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:06,080
I'm like are these policies actually

229
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,170
being enforced in the organization guys

230
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:14,390
the total honesty says of course not way

231
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,980
too expensive to enforce all the

232
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:19,190
policies you know that that's crazy like

233
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,960
literally and I actually looked it up

234
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,000
for this present patient this is what I

235
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,280
actually wrote in the report for their

236
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,160
policy like and I was reading it again

237
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,170
I'm like maybe I was a little harsh to

238
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:32,240
basically say that basically it's only

239
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,680
worth a paper that they're printed on

240
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,790
you know type of thing but literally

241
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:40,160
they had policies that they didn't

242
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,750
enforce it all you know type of thing

243
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,760
and it just like the brazenness of like

244
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,430
up he's on policies it why do we enforce

245
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:50,870
them that their fur on it you know so

246
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:54,890
this is a good story about this is when

247
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:57,050
i was at diebold and i don't know if you

248
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,370
guys know or not that i actually

249
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:00,980
reported to dave can do CSO debo at the

250
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:06,140
time and he was famous whenever we do

251
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,000
not and we did a lot of audit so it was

252
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,350
customers awning us

253
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,240
different regulations that we had to do

254
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,300
an audit he come in for we do day to day

255
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,940
three days month-long sometimes he come

256
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,010
in to sit down for the audit just make

257
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,150
sure everything is you know going

258
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:23,630
alright heliopause computer I do a set

259
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:26,120
demo or whoever the audience was he

260
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,550
would actually do a set demo for whoever

261
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,320
we actually tried to plan it out that if

262
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,120
we're like in hot water for an audit

263
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,920
that we'd actually have candy come in

264
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,410
and do a set down like a shiny over here

265
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:39,050
and everything so we're doing an audit

266
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:40,490
with a customer like you know how are

267
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:41,990
you doing with our security what are you

268
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:44,960
monitoring for all that stuff the otter

269
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,140
actually came in it's like oh do you

270
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,270
know what fishing is asking Dave Kennedy

271
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:53,720
this you know because I get I'm pretty

272
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,030
familiar with it you know that wrote a

273
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,640
couple tools about you like okay let me

274
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,190
tell you what fishing is like this is

275
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,470
the guy that wrote set and eere had set

276
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:05,720
created at this point this guy went on

277
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,820
to tell Kennedy about fishing you know

278
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:13,190
so and after that it's like okay you

279
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,960
know like let me show you an example of

280
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,540
it like and of course if anybody knows

281
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,640
Dave Kennedy this is how he actually

282
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,550
gives a demo you don't know how he types

283
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,620
what he's wanted tight literally

284
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,830
lightning-fast across it well the main

285
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,630
customer that we were doing he actually

286
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:32,450
came out after Kennedy laughs he's like

287
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:37,310
I really don't know what he did but that

288
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:40,190
was amazing I had no idea but it was

289
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:45,410
awesome and it's very funny with that

290
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:52,190
there so next one employees so when

291
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:53,180
you're dealing with the place especially

292
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:56,540
when they're confronted with being under

293
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,670
the spotlight with audits sometimes you

294
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,440
get some funny reactions and I'm going

295
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,450
to tell one just because time was I'm

296
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:05,750
going pretty fast we're doing up one of

297
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,990
the FFIEC examinations here and one of

298
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,550
the things that you always prep your

299
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,080
kind of audience at who's going to be

300
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,540
audited and home hey don't be dishonest

301
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,090
you know you want to give good answers

302
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:19,670
but don't elaborate don't feel like if

303
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,380
there's an awkward pause in the silence

304
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,180
that you need to actually give

305
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,620
more information you know it's always

306
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,810
good advice anybody going under the

307
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:29,210
spotlight to this we have one guy on our

308
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:32,630
team that took that to heart we had an

309
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,280
examiner talking about like user

310
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,900
provisioning and all that stuff he was

311
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,570
going over what we did for our unix

312
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,490
linux systems it was going over all the

313
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,590
details with that and of course you know

314
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,810
if anybody's you know familiar with you

315
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:46,250
know auditing or just you know general

316
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,840
questions it's open questions and closed

317
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,000
questions you know closed questions are

318
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,800
you can answer with a yes or no you know

319
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,230
one word open questions like okay you

320
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:56,600
need to give a response you know type of

321
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,420
thing so this guy literally said oh is

322
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,340
that the same to your window systems as

323
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:06,340
well as the provision guys like yes

324
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,990
awkward science like if there was no

325
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:11,630
talking in 10 seconds you know and as

326
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,310
you're like sitting in audio that you're

327
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,950
like okay yeah he's not asking any more

328
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:18,020
questions that everything literally like

329
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:23,710
after that he's like oh the examiner

330
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:28,220
okay didn't ask one more question with

331
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,670
that there so here's one with a dealing

332
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:36,350
with PCI so we had a qsan and he wasn't

333
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:38,570
the most technically mine he came from a

334
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,910
law enforcement background just kind of

335
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,860
set this up and everything but we're

336
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,590
going through we're actually and acquire

337
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:47,990
and talking about where we store

338
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:50,090
cardholder data and what the process is

339
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,590
and how we actually interconnect

340
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,780
everything so the qsa actually came out

341
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,060
and said you know you show me where the

342
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,040
data is stored to one of our mainframe

343
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,070
guys and everything yeah I came down

344
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:04,340
like I can't show you where the data

345
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,720
board it could be anywhere on the disk

346
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,360
like literally he thought like we're on

347
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,160
the platter is cardholder data like it's

348
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,530
like asking where the woman in the red

349
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:21,410
dress is on the matrix like the guy had

350
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:23,330
no idea and the funniest thing about

351
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:27,530
this is the chu-sa looked at me like is

352
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:32,000
that right I don't know like at this

353
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,920
point i'm literally doing the picard

354
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,290
like

355
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:39,379
looks like Don John is his name but gone

356
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:43,220
I think he means the path to where the

357
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:46,220
cardholder data is store stored he's

358
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:49,009
like oh yeah yeah I could shown that

359
00:15:49,009 --> 00:15:52,730
yeah like where would your mind go to

360
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:58,550
show platter like disk level on this but

361
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:01,579
this is another great one awareness so

362
00:16:01,579 --> 00:16:03,949
we're talking about at an organization

363
00:16:03,949 --> 00:16:05,990
like what to do to screw self-awareness

364
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:07,639
what other things we can do we did a

365
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:10,339
week-long awareness thing for every week

366
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:12,639
I think it would send out November and

367
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,980
like okay you know what more can we

368
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,259
spruce up with our awareness so we're

369
00:16:18,259 --> 00:16:19,759
thrown out some different ideas what we

370
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,230
can do different from the last year and

371
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,600
everything and you know just a different

372
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,699
awareness posters all that stuff and

373
00:16:25,699 --> 00:16:28,579
everything so the one guys and their

374
00:16:28,579 --> 00:16:31,339
kind of gun nuts and i'm all for guns

375
00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:33,259
and everything they're like hey there's

376
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:34,790
a big thing you know there was just an

377
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,589
active shooter or a few months ago you

378
00:16:36,589 --> 00:16:38,120
know type of thing why don't we do

379
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,860
awareness like that and what that's

380
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,350
great idea why don't we do awareness

381
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:44,540
around active shooter he's like why

382
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,269
don't we run in and ski masks and take

383
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:49,699
over a conference room as kind of a mock

384
00:16:49,699 --> 00:16:52,610
active shooter situation like literally

385
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:56,240
he and another guys like let's take over

386
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,819
a conference room and this will be the

387
00:16:58,819 --> 00:17:05,449
awareness that idea look like can you

388
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:08,209
imagine who would get shot during that

389
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:10,099
if somebody was concealed carrying or

390
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:13,039
cops recall they would not be happy with

391
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:20,030
that organism so consultants these are

392
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:22,819
some of my favorite ones here because

393
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:24,740
even though like most of the combs

394
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,750
consultant he hired you hire them to

395
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,400
perform a job to give you different

396
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,130
advice and everything but sometimes

397
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,620
they're just they're crazy you know like

398
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,330
they look at stuff and just have a

399
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:38,539
backwards view of things so first story

400
00:17:38,539 --> 00:17:41,900
on this then encrypted another pci story

401
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:46,100
i got onto pci stories so this was when

402
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,200
i was at an organization we're getting

403
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,980
it done so and one of the things you do

404
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,600
is you show them where the cardholder

405
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,370
data is stored I got a lot of cardholder

406
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:58,190
data stored stories for some reason so

407
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,840
anyway so we're going into the database

408
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,720
and looking at where Carlo today is

409
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,700
stored actual you know database tables

410
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,559
all that stuff and everything and I did

411
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,750
a mock example here this is my own

412
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,860
database and not showing the actual

413
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,960
picture but I'm shown of the day today

414
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,389
so I'm kind of a sarcastic I'm like yeah

415
00:18:14,389 --> 00:18:16,130
as you can see you know everything's

416
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,350
encrypted unless you can rig wing-dings

417
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:20,000
you know you won't be able to you know

418
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,610
read and everything he's like is that

419
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:27,889
what that is wingdings like no man its

420
00:18:27,889 --> 00:18:30,049
binary data trying to be rendered on the

421
00:18:30,049 --> 00:18:33,950
screen oh oh that's what that is so

422
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:36,200
after you left at everything i run into

423
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,320
our IT office like guys I got a great

424
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,450
idea for a new encryption strategy we're

425
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,580
changing the font to wing day so like

426
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:47,860
this is awesome you know I bet they

427
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:51,139
another one that we had customer hired

428
00:18:51,139 --> 00:18:53,330
another consultant had caught us again I

429
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:55,990
so and a number of the different

430
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:58,700
regulations and stuff of that nature so

431
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,190
and one of the things he was a little

432
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:03,049
weird you know everybody in security is

433
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:04,700
a little weird you know type thing but

434
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,490
this guy you know it's just a little off

435
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:09,230
but we didn't see it through the audit

436
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,909
and everything like that well one of the

437
00:19:10,909 --> 00:19:12,860
things that are pretty common you know

438
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,659
you go out to dinner with the customer

439
00:19:14,659 --> 00:19:16,279
and you know just have a good time and

440
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:20,240
everything and one girl that was on my

441
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,340
team younger girl this is a first job

442
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:25,309
and everything got the leisure of

443
00:19:25,309 --> 00:19:28,070
sitting next to him and I think she was

444
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,840
sitting next to me but you know far

445
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,769
enough that wasn't here in their

446
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:32,960
conversation and we're all talking and

447
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,070
everything and all the sudden there was

448
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,779
like a break a couple people went to the

449
00:19:35,779 --> 00:19:38,630
bathroom and he went to the bathroom and

450
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:41,299
she turns me he's like why did you sit

451
00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:43,549
me next to him I'm like what are you

452
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:45,409
talking about like it can't be that bad

453
00:19:45,409 --> 00:19:49,010
and everything he's like no he literally

454
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:51,539
has a doll collection

455
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:54,119
and they all have personalities he told

456
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:58,049
Mike not it now come on it can't be that

457
00:19:58,049 --> 00:20:00,299
weird you know and everything he's like

458
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:03,539
no it's weird so from that point I'm

459
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:05,580
like I want to hear what's going on over

460

00:21:25,499 --> 00:21:27,239
rock back anytime soon it's been three

491
00:21:27,239 --> 00:21:28,799
months and everything like yeah he's

492
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,539
expecting a couple more documents so we

493
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,539
get all to them like everybody uh so

494
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:35,460
when can I we got all the evidence you

495
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,139
have all the evidence yeah I have all

496
00:21:37,139 --> 00:21:39,509
the evidence okay when can I get my rock

497
00:21:39,509 --> 00:21:44,460
I don't know like it's going to take let

498
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,979
me know there for months to get the rock

499
00:21:46,979 --> 00:21:49,830
a mic in your freaking kidding me right

500
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:52,409
like good you're not taking seven months

501
00:21:52,409 --> 00:21:53,970
to produce a rock for me and everything

502
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:56,190
and of course he comes at me it's like

503
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,739
yeah I don't know if you know anything

504
00:21:58,739 --> 00:22:01,019
about the PCI industry but it takes a

505
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:03,659
while you know that they like dude I was

506
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:05,220
aqsa before

507
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,470
it doesn't take this long I expect the

508
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:09,179
rock in a week you know type of thing

509
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:11,280
you've had three months i just gave you

510
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,320
some final evidence like oh okay he

511
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,700
eventually like gets me the rock like

512
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,710
two days from there but in between that

513
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:22,919
time he's like oh by the way I need the

514
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:25,020
version of your AV on your linux systems

515
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:28,049
oh my god okay that's interesting of

516
00:22:28,049 --> 00:22:31,490
like we don't have a VR linux systems

517
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:34,350
because we don't commonly affect you

518
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,580
know they're not commonly affected by

519
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,299
viruses you know type of thing he's like

520
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:41,700
well you need something you know you

521
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,650
need that AV on your linux systems

522
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:49,200
they're like it explain to me why AV is

523
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,350
effectively required on our on our

524
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,760
systems when they're not commonly

525
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,710
affected by viruses so he comes at me

526
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,270
he's like hey they're still vulnerable

527
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:03,419
to malware you know and it won't go pass

528
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:06,750
our QA you know type of thing so i don't

529
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,950
know if you guys ever done that i

530
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:09,809
basically shoot it back and like dude

531
00:23:09,809 --> 00:23:12,750
reread the standard it says commonly

532
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:15,600
affected it was like you need to tell me

533
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,370
that linux systems are commonly affected

534
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:21,210
by viruses or it's an NA you know type

535
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:26,159
of thing so he comes back never seen an

536
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,740
instance of commonly of malware on a

537
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,250
linux machine like yes but there's a

538
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,990
separation between security and

539
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:36,600
compliance and I don't equate them to

540
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,080
the same thing so of course I fire back

541
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,360
to the company I'm not interested in you

542
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,000
pushing agenda of security controls you

543
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,980
know type of thing so at this point he

544
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,870
says he was involved with it I didn't

545
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:55,470
and to top it all off excuse a never

546
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:58,409
came on site once for this audit so

547
00:23:58,409 --> 00:24:02,250
which is if York USA is not allowed you

548
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,620
have to be on site at some point during

549
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:08,820
the journey issuance of a rock so he

550
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:12,179
comes back USA or a QA has spoke here's

551
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:15,990
what you can do do avoid AV being on

552
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:18,840
your linux systems it gives me this long

553
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:22,530
under a list of things which someone

554
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:25,260
actually do apply to pti which is valid

555
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,390
you know they have to be there for some

556
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:29,220
of the controls with that and some of

557
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,620
them don't you know like not surfing

558
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:34,440
from the internet you know security I'm

559
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,790
not arguing security versus of

560
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:38,280
compliance but I'm like guys you're not

561
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,600
doing your job you know with this here

562
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,270
his boss gets into the email chain and

563
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:49,430
at this point their vp of compliance

564
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:52,170
actually is CC it into this and this is

565
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:56,340
a large company not to name any names

566
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:59,520
but it starts with a tee ends in wife

567
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,820
and yeah not naming any names you know

568
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:04,740
type of thing so his boss comes in he's

569
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:07,710
like yeah and it was a lot longer i'm

570
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:09,450
sparing you some of the details and

571
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:12,420
everything but he basically says our

572
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:15,560
criteria for measuring avion systems is

573
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:20,100
aniket viruses and is a remediation port

574
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:23,340
that was there two criteria for it not

575
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,710
the commonality of it actually being

576
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:28,050
exposed with that and then he actually

577
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:32,220
gives a great day of what they're

578
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,050
actually saying they're like hey some

579
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:36,090
card brands and some big acquires so

580
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:39,360
that actually told us that we want more

581
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,460
protection on systems not that it

582
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,650
actually is in the PCI standard we just

583
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:45,360
want more protection so can you guys

584
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,850
actually which that for us they're

585
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:49,890
actually in the email actually dogma

586
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:51,840
this is verbatim you know with a little

587
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,910
bit of some of the stuff cut out and

588
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:56,730
every time so I basically come back and

589
00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:00,150
on the leg as it's not what the standard

590
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:03,120
says you need to apply the commonality

591
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,070
of it and if it is and I don't think I

592
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,870
put this in there I was like I want a

593
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:08,760
letter from you that actually says

594
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,530
you're considering systems like this in

595
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:14,910
there now here's here's the gem I go

596
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:17,490
back to the previous year rock they

597
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:20,220
actually had in their verbiage in the

598
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:24,030
five dot one or Linux UNIX systems which

599
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:26,430
are not commonly affected by viruses

600
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:28,140
they actually had that in the last

601
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:31,920
year's rock and I'm like guys if that's

602
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,370
the case

603
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:34,740
you know tell me what what what changed

604
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,540
you like either you do consider them

605
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,250
commonly affected by viruses look great

606
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:40,800
or you don't then it's na you know for

607
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:46,290
the systems so he comes back to the qsa

608
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:48,809
boss is like the control sounds like

609
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:51,300
kisses same control as last year I don't

610
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,210
understand the problem the problem is

611
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:56,520
we've never had a V on our Linux system

612
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,050
say actually even had a different

613
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:01,110
version of a V in the rock that they

614
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:03,630
actually cited us for we were using like

615
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:05,730
kaspersky where they cited us like oh

616
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:07,440
yeah they have semantic on their linux

617
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,840
system it's and everything like called

618
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,600
them out even said like guys your first

619
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,460
ones that didn't come on site you're the

620
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,080
first ones that basically told me that

621
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,150
you know takes like seven months they

622
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:21,179
actually complete a rock and you're the

623
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:22,890
first ones they actually tell me that AV

624
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:26,790
is effectively on all systems here for

625
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:29,370
the next day they're like oh yeah we

626
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:31,190
need to do a conference call pull me up

627
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:34,110
some of their senior people like yeah

628
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:36,840
Jotham you're right we don't need to do

629
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,050
that and oh by the way we need to send

630
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:41,820
somebody out there you know because

631
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,140
we're not allowed to issue a rock

632
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,940
without sending somebody out there like

633
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:48,030
I know that so they send somebody out

634
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:50,790
there they're literally on there at one

635
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:53,340
hour one hour they were there on our

636
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,050
site so they flew out for one hour

637
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:57,540
looked at a couple of background checks

638
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,820
and just talk to me in my office no

639
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,490
evidence nothing like that and at the

640
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:05,010
time company what I was with was both an

641
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:07,830
issuer and it acquire like we actually

642
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:10,620
stored card track data as we were

643
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,150
obligated to do that we actually

644
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:14,580
imprinted card track data on their then

645
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,200
look at any of those systems you know

646
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,580
and everything so just kind of a

647
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:22,140
foreshadow don't always trust York USA

648
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,600
and I'd say that imac USA now don't only

649
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,490
stress York USA go back with facts and

650
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:28,920
everything and kind of do that the last

651
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,620
