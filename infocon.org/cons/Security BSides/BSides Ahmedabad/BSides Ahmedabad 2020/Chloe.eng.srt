hi everyone my name is climas doggie

3
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,619
and today i'm going to give you three

4
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:30,779
pointers to help with basically being

5
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:33,210
burned out it happens to us and it

6
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:34,170
usually happens some word not basically

7
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,530
having a good balance between our

8
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,420
personal life and a work life so there's

9
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,580
three ways how to deal with this one

10
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,830
unplug completely that means turn off

11
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:46,560
your devices get off twitter get off

12
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:49,410
discord and just get off twitch for

13
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,990
anywhere between I always recommend 10

14
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:55,410
to 12 hours once a week is this gonna be

15
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:57,000
really helpful for you umm second thing

16
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,099
have a to-do list

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,720
basically write out all the things you

18
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,790
need to get done for the day or

19
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,408
throughout the week or for the next

20
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:05,909
couple of weeks or whatnot and just

21
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:07,950
cross them out when you get it done and

22
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:10,350
do it first in the morning at night and

23
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:13,050
throughout the day so declutter is your

24
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:15,179
brain and last but not least I always

25
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:17,610
have three things that you're grateful

26
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,170
for so you can either write down or if

27
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,729
you have it in your head I think of

28
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,770
three things are grateful for for the

29
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:24,539
day or three positive things that happen

30
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,429
to you for the day I hope that's helpful

31
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,540
and if you ever need anything just feel

32
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,540
