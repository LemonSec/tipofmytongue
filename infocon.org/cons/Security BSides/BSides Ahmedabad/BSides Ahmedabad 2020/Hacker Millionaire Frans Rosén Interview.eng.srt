1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:11,459
ah can you please introduce yourself yes

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:13,949
my name is Franz Rosen I may invest in

3
00:00:11,459 --> 00:00:16,800
Sweden and work as a security adviser at

4
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:19,590
the tech to fight and I do a lot of bug

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,439
bounty hunting online

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:27,869
okay how much time do you spend on

7
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:31,619
hunting bugs so hunting embarks I spend

8
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:34,079
around maybe it depends I do like three

9
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:36,570
months and then three months off and

10
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,400
three months on three months off so but

11
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,309
during those three months that I

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,790
actually do hunting I would say I'd

13
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:47,940
probably do it like three or four hours

14
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:51,089
at least today maybe take a few days off

15
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:54,119
but it to me it's really important not

16
00:00:51,089 --> 00:00:57,739
to get like burned out so that's why I

17
00:00:54,119 --> 00:01:00,900
tend to take some breaks and like try to

18
00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:05,689
move away from hacking and then going

19
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:08,310
back okay what advice would you give to

20
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:11,070
your fans and to the community members

21
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:16,380
to keep up with all the new trends and

22
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:19,919
techniques so keeping up with trends

23
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:23,070
I mean the easiest I mean no Theseus

24
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,549
maybe but the the best way to actually

25
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:30,419
keep up is to read read everything

26
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:33,899
read it all read on slides read if all

27
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:36,749
the blogs read the tweets everything

28
00:01:33,899 --> 00:01:38,460
like you need to consume all the

29
00:01:36,749 --> 00:01:40,640
information that gets out there and you

30
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:44,210
need to keep up-to-date with everything

31
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:48,119
everywhere so to me I'm probably reading

32
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:49,949
like majority of my time being awake

33
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:52,409
when I'm actually hunting because you

34
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,659
need to keep up with everything it's

35
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:57,359
it's a lot of work I think it's like

36
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:59,880
Warren Buffett said it said it the same

37
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:02,520
like you need to read everything and it

38
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,670
makes sense in hockey as well like in

39
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,860
to know and understand the most of the

40
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:11,849
new things coming out to be on top of

41
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:16,170
everything great what is the most

42
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:19,670
interesting but you've ever found it's a

43
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:23,819
hard question with the worst bodies I

44
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:26,309
think one of those times where I felt I

45
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:29,518
was actually getting scared on what I've

46
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:31,430
actually started was when I reported a

47
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:34,080
security ship roulette sink ribbit and

48
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:36,870
the whole idea was that I showed that

49
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,900
they had a weakness so I could issue

50
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:44,340
certificates for almost every of their

51
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:46,620
customer and I got help from two really

52
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:49,620
big companies to issue certificates for

53
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:52,680
their in their domains and when I sent

54
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:54,690
that to let's encrypt before they didn't

55
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,760
really understand how bad it was but

56
00:02:54,690 --> 00:03:00,120
when I sent those certificates to them

57
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:03,569
like the whole tone changed so that was

58
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:06,420
that was pretty pretty scary like it was

59
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:07,768
number one on Hacker News that they shut

60
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,619
down because of the security incident

61
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:12,450
and that they reported back to me like

62
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,400
don't issue anymore certificates we

63
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:17,010
understand the problem like everything

64
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,230
was just like boiling and I was super

65
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:22,858
scared but they were really happy that I

66
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:27,060
told them and everything went well in

67
00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:28,920
then threats a question which lot of us

68
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,650
and I guess pretty much everybody who

69
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,720
knows you would want to ask him how do

70
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:38,430
you really feel to be a believer at such

71
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:41,730
a young age I I it's hard question I

72
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:50,430
don't I don't live like a millionaire I

73
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:52,290
am I try to stay like a lot of my a lot

74
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:55,109
of the bounties are made I put into

75
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:59,608
investments and I'm invested into other

76
00:03:55,109 --> 00:04:01,200
companies to make them grow so I don't

77
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:03,569
know if I'm technically a millionaire

78
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,540
actually because like I'm I'm making

79
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:09,510
sure that a lot of people can can work

80
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,160
and go to a job and that we can build

81
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:15,410
stuff too

82
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:18,110
so I'm more focused on that than to like

83
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:22,460
I have a little super small little car

84
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:26,470
and Sweden so like it fits almost for

85
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:29,000
people my kids i I really don't don't

86
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:33,200
exaggerate in my in my life I would say

87
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:37,400
and I focus more on like getting money

88
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:40,420
where it needs to be right now and to

89
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:43,940
make something grow and that's my focus

90
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:47,300
