00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:23,989
[Applause]

3
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,980
this is for my person who knows I didn't

4
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:37,140
really know that I was supposed to speak

5
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:40,150
 happens

6
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:45,790
so my question is did you learn anything

7
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:47,530
today and us being here with all you

8
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:50,379
guys have learned something that's very

9
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:52,030
very important that is creating these

10
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:57,610
kind of communities that will occur

11
00:00:52,030 --> 00:01:00,280
today that in 2018 I went to another

12
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:03,250
conference called Hong Kong and it's

13
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:06,430
also India was my first time ever being

14
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:07,600
in this continent and I was really

15
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:10,560
excited to be there

16
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,149
I didn't know about hockey then I

17
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,039
was there to blog in France in a good

18
00:01:13,149 --> 00:01:18,100
time

19
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:22,450
what I do what I did know was a lot of

20
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:25,419
authority about 25 years of knowledge of

21
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:27,759
active directory 45,000 hours is Bill

22
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:30,070
consultant active directory the kind of

23
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,030
standard it's not that I mean what was

24
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:33,999
in Europe when it comes to

25
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:35,859
infrastructure I knew that these never

26
00:01:33,999 --> 00:01:38,649
didn't really know how to shop whether

27
00:01:35,859 --> 00:01:41,949
or using verb or any kind of rituals

28
00:01:38,649 --> 00:01:44,140
that now is my daily driver not even a

29
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:48,639
single day goes by without me using her

30
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:50,799
today and and it shakes my life but

31
00:01:48,639 --> 00:01:53,798
Monty changed my life in so many ways

32
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:56,280
and I know he takes a lot to be relaxed

33
00:01:53,799 --> 00:02:00,069
too so I'm very grateful for that

34
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:04,810
and if I had a really little talk here

35
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:07,979
it would probably be how to turn to your

36
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,979
dudes into Chris

37
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,130
[Music]

38
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,860
so I'm making dinner for her and it's

39
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:11,420
like should I watch TV series now or

40
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:15,440
play some games or should I learn about

41
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:18,619
hacking before about these I will

42
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:22,340
probably do with other things but I went

43
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:28,190
to a life hacking event in in a Savannah

44
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:29,870
called h1 3220 and and being there in in

45
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:33,410
meeting with other hackers I realized

46
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:36,380
one thing this is where I belong

47
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:37,430
I found my community my my group of

48
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:40,420
friends dead

49
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:43,730
that I could talk to that suddenly is

50
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:45,890
ended my conversation whatever whatever

51
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:48,920
thing I started to talk to you they were

52
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:51,500
able to continue that and I felt and I

53
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:53,328
realized that they this is where I'm

54
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,459
supposed to be this is where I belong

55
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:58,220
this is my community

56
00:03:54,459 --> 00:04:01,250
none of those guys live in my town they

57
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:02,250
don't even translate to my country but

58
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,680
you know

59
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:06,690
it's really far away most of the friends

60
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,320
that I have nowadays our own thing

61
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:10,859
tonight

62
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:16,560
there are over there on Twitter there on

63
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:18,420
slack channels they are in and that's

64
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,608
why these kind of events are so

65
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:25,490
important to this when you travel here

66
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:27,960
to network you find friends and you a

67
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:31,290
couple of days goes by right maybe

68
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:37,320
sending out a DM to somebody

69
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:39,960
the dog was great and that's where

70
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,610
collaboration comes into play because if

71
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:45,239
you are hacking with somebody

72
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:49,170
both of you are living it now you're not

73
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:51,060
spending time on dues because both of

74
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:52,740
you are trying to get the same thing

75
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,140
keep sending the same report what

76
00:04:52,740 --> 00:05:04,500
happens

77
00:04:54,140 --> 00:05:07,770
goose agencies battery solo my key to

78
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:09,720
success was investing time in myself is

79
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:12,299
definitely sitting by my computer or

80
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:15,080
even wasting time on on watching Netflix

81
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:17,880
I was really into sex later I was

82
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:20,700
outrunning birth and any kind of website

83
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,770
that I visited I turned off I turned off

84
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:25,680
all the active scanning parts of Earth

85
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:28,490
and I just had it running next to it so

86
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,650
I got used to seeing the thing

87
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:31,910
how the server is bosses work what kind

88
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:34,130
of infrastructure is this

89
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:36,260
maybe they're their users kind of some

90
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:38,570
kind of person that I didn't know about

91
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:41,330
that ability to salting that is defined

92
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:47,330
as experience if I say that vacation

93
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:50,359
today it's me to practice so the main

94
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:53,539
question is why would you even start in

95
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:56,570
this got them industry when automation

96
00:05:53,540 --> 00:06:01,040
in AI was going to take it all right

97
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:03,770
that's what people are telling you for

98
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:06,230
your future that's what the human mind

99
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:08,510
but simply because we can look for

100
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:12,890
patterns can look for anomalies the

101
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:15,380
different things that arise like Francis

102
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:17,780
is great talk today like API fussing

103
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:20,420
right you know get it covered a couple

104
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:23,090
of the content and if you use your brain

105
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:29,000
if it says mr. Li la another sister

106
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:32,299
method nothing try system works it's a

107
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,330
combination on finding things so my

108
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:37,940
takeaway from you is to invest time in

109
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:40,550
yourself invest time in finding friends

110
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:42,620
that do the same thing because in the

111
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:44,510
end if you're getting good at this stuff

112
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:47,630
you will be give never of hacking and

113
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:49,760
also remember we are all humans after

114
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:52,460
all we're not machines so if you're

115
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:55,280
submitting the report try to make that

116
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:57,020
report as good as possible because what

117
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,030
that's going to happen is that you're

118
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:02,390
going to start to take a relationship

119
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:05,030
with a program human running the

120
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:09,440
programs and they want to find the value

121
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:11,440
there's big differences in spending a

122
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,390
lot of time on you

123
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:18,200
finding this is weird quirky subdomain

124
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:21,680
with a vintage installation of CMS has

125
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:24,050
admin admin active Onan said my weird

126
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,570
dev domain you're gonna write this way

127
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:29,120
traitor 14c I got our seed the out

128
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:30,860
of this it's really bad Bob and there's

129
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,980
pulses gonna be old crap to me stick

130
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:47,480
from that the revenue driven nation is

131
00:07:33,980 --> 00:08:06,200
going to be shut down if we're able to

132
00:07:47,480 --> 00:08:12,350
do that really cool that everybody's

133
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:14,150
everyday big battle value customer that

134
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:16,640
they understand that you are a den

135
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:18,650
commissars into the system it's going to

136
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:21,140
start something called human interaction

137
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:25,489
might just be social engineering here

138
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:27,500
that's always others go but but if you

139
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:34,880
can inspire in the tree are certain

140
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:36,070
researchers what did the reports these

141
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,159
two qualities

142
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:43,190
maybe we'll get invited to challenge and

143
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:45,110
challenges that's good money and that

144
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:48,860
means restricted initiative company

145
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:50,470
maybe a little bit of loyalty and in the

146
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:55,280
end isn't that what we don't want

147
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:57,549
friends helping friends thank you

148
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,549
[Applause]
