hey guys this is dagestan in school and

3
00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:31,029
today on a talk with you about something

4
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:34,940
very interesting the very touchy subject

5
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:37,340
mental burnout to be honest I

6
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:40,280
experienced this situation for for so

7
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:44,960
many time so far so I had to deal with

8
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:47,200
in the understanding to end down to the

9
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,930
bottom silly before it happens usually

10
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:53,180
your brain is not really able to see or

11
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:55,550
understand though you have the simple

12
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:59,900
thing so at that point you have to do

13
00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:03,980
something in my experience all you have

14
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:06,259
to do is just try to go outside and

15
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:08,000
leave everything behind you for a while

16
00:01:06,259 --> 00:01:09,439
and try to do something else

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,659
the more you are doing things you never

18
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:15,199
did before the more you're going to get

19
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:17,960
a lot of positive energy and a lot of

20
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,210
positive karma if I can say that way and

21
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,919
it's going to help you to see things

22
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:25,460
from a different perspective when we are

23
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,710
coming back so go outside connect with

24
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:30,589
the nature do something else and you're

25
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:33,999
gonna overpass any hard moment in your

26
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,999
life take care bye
