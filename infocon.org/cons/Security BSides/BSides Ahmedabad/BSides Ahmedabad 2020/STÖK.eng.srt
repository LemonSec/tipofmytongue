00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,880
hey buddy

3
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:31,279
so so you deal with burnout right and

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:34,640
that's that's normal we we all do it

5
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,760
but the thing is that it's easy to

6
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,960
overcome

7
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,440
if you just accept it

8
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,160
most bug hunters end up in that

9
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,480
situation

10
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:48,640
sooner or later because we're we are so

11
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,919
focused on learning new stuff and trying

12
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,640
to

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,239
use all our skills and we're comparing

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,360
each other with each other and we're

15
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:00,000
doing a lot of stuff that

16
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,399
our minds probably aren't trained for

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,760
right

18
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:06,159
and that's okay make sure that you

19
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,920
have a long-term goal of what you're

20
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,479
gonna want to succeed with

21
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,320
and and then you do it in bite sizes a

22
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,240
little bit every day and

23
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,360
do things like exercise like i

24
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,399
skateboard for once

25
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,920
or or i go out running and if you're in

26
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,759
quarantine that's going to be a struggle

27
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,600
for you i understand that but

28
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,520
try to get some exercise in your body

29
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,839
try to do something that hasn't

30
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,920
anything to do with with hacking like

31
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,040
like a little bit of recreational gaming

32
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,000
is good for you as well

33
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,119
a lot of hackers that i know we we play

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,759
computer games

35
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,799
because we love the concept of you know

36
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,400
playing computer games

37
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,000
maybe you know reading a book or

38
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,560
learning something new or picking up

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,720
another hobby that's not only

40
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,880
hacking related it's the solution for

41
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,880
you

42
00:01:50,079 --> 00:02:01,839
anyway stay safe and

43
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:01,840
live long and prosper
