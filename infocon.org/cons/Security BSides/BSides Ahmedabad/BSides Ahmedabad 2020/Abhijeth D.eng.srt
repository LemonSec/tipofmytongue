2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,140
I'm not an expert I'm not a guru I'm not

3
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,669
trying to preach or something here I've

4
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,920
been doing Sabbath security for more

5
00:00:27,669 --> 00:00:31,570
than 10 years now and in the last few

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,949
years there have been so many times that

7
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:34,720
I got super point out and I was like

8
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:36,099
this close to leaving hacking and

9
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,519
leaving cybersecurity and doing

10
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,930
something else I'll share a couple of my

11
00:00:39,519 --> 00:00:43,390
experiences when I was really young

12
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:45,039
people used to tell me hey man like you

13
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:47,199
should stay away from computer for some

14
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,370
Mars or they were like hey you should do

15
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:50,949
something else other than hacking

16
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:54,160
happiness or everything I was like oh no

17
00:00:50,949 --> 00:00:56,440
that's but trust me I was

18
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,839
actually thinking if I say eight hours

19
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,339
away from hacking that's like ten

20
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,109
cross-site scripting which is equal to

21
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,500
like five thousand dollars or something

22
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:05,350
like that

23
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,729
trust me it's all like once you

24
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:08,919
get gray hair like me you will

25
00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:10,929
understand the importance of having real

26
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,950
life experiences and in fact for that

27
00:01:10,929 --> 00:01:13,720
matter of fact I would actually

28
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:15,340
recommend you to have friends who are

29
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,349
not necessarily doing information

30
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:19,690
security it will only help your mind

31
00:01:17,349 --> 00:01:22,179
mindset and it will only make you a

32
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:23,830
better hacker another thing that's very

33
00:01:22,179 --> 00:01:25,209
important is like people have people

34
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:27,670
told me hey you should be doing

35
00:01:25,209 --> 00:01:29,920
physically physical exercise and then I

36
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:32,140
was like again who does physical

37
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,700
exercise but two years ago when I went

38
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,229
to the doctor my doctor my doctor was

39
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,569
like hey observe

40
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:40,090
your back is and after that I

41
00:01:37,569 --> 00:01:41,800
started exercising so I can actually

42
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:43,119
tell you that exercising and doing a

43
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,750
little bit of yoga or something like

44
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:49,209
