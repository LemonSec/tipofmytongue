eight hours every Thursday to hunt for

10
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,269

architecture with a team lead that works

35
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:43,699
together and hacks together to minimize

36
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:45,059
do dupes and create better reflections

37
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:48,240
okay

38
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,369

it intersect Twitter for a lot of people

43
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:03,450
be hungry and when I'm saying that I'm

44
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,798
only hunting on Thursdays I'm spending

45
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,709
the rest of the days learning new things

46
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,979
it's just I have one day a week fully

47
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:12,420
focused when I go all-in and exploits

48
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:14,519
the things that I learned from the

49
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,958
during the rest of the week instead of

50
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:18,390
just you know you're doing your work

51
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:20,970
your 9:00 to 5:00 and you go and homey

52
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:23,160
you're preparing dinner and just hacking

53
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:25,290
like an hour before you go to sleep you

54
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,329
can't really get into the zone so I

55
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:32,190
decided I'm taking those separate hours

56
00:02:27,329 --> 00:02:34,859
into making it one day okay since you've

57
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:36,420
been there in the dust g-sensor very

58
00:02:34,859 --> 00:02:38,849
long time you have a massive following

59
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:41,280
I'm sure your fans

60
00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:44,129
but what to notice what is the most

61
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,730
interesting but you have ever found that

62
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:49,709
has to be one of my x-axis I guess I'd

63
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:52,409
love x-axis and I knew for those

64
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:54,150
everywhere and they are pretty common to

65
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:57,298
find if you know what you're looking for

66
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:59,879
I can of course not go to into any

67
00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:02,010
details when it comes to how that came

68
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:03,719
out and saying some of the most

69
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:09,510
interesting things are hiding in plain

70
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:12,120
sight okay the last questions how was

71
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:13,439
your overall experience and besides that

72
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,319
Wow

73
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:20,060
it's been overwhelming this is such a

74
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:23,280
great event and for a first-timer and

75
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:25,769
visiting in this area of India and then

76
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,340
meeting all the local InfoSec people

77
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:30,629
that are here it's mind-blowing

78
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:32,730
people normally ask if you would

79
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:35,608
recommend the conference if you go to it

80
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:37,500
I would feel hard to say that if there's

81
00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:40,739
if this conference is back I'll be back

82
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:43,500
next year well we are pretty honored to

83
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:45,060
hear that any lost anything on which you

84
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,030
would want to give it to your fans who

85
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:50,459
are just beginning yes absolutely I

86
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:52,949
would say I get so many questions

87
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:55,049
regarding how can I start in bug

88
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:57,689
bounties how can I start hacking and the

89
00:03:55,049 --> 00:04:00,989
secret is really really easy just start

90
00:03:57,689 --> 00:04:03,209
if you begin looking for it for bugs you

91
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:06,180
will find bugs it but we only read about

92
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:09,389
finding bugs you will continue reading

93
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:13,259
about finding bugs and end up not having

94
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:15,389
any also if all your friends are going

95
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:17,339
in a certain direction and looking for a

96
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:19,470
certain kind of class and doing

97
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:21,750
different kind of stuff I always suggest

98
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:23,190
if you go the opposite way because of

99
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:25,919
the old these guys are going down the

100
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:29,039
new area I'm going to find the same kind

101
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:32,039
of information try to think outside the

102
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:34,820
box and go down the way that's where the

103
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:34,820
new research is

104
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,039
okay thank you source maritime storm it

105

106
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:42,550
besides antibody and we do hope that it

107
