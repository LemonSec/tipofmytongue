1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:04,279
I put it around and then you're like

2
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,220
I don't even know what song that is just

3
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,900
stuck in my head

4
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,799
don't don't do

5
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,580
it

6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,180
foreign

7
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,620
never edited slides while on stage I

8
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,239
don't know what you're talking about

9
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,120
how dumb is that

10
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,899
okay

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,420
we're gonna get kicked off with

12
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,520
another really fun presentation

13
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,540
I took Kevin's uh web app pen testing

14
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,360
course way back in the day and man I I

15
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,040
don't think I've ever laughed harder in

16
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,080
a pen testing course

17
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,180
so much fun

18
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,000
it's terrible

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,280
um and I didn't do very well in the CTF

20
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,180
but that's okay you know it happens

21
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,740
so um

22
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,979
we have uh Kevin Johnson here he's the

23
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:41,460
CEO of secure ideas and he is here to

24
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,320
tell us about seeing further building

25
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,020
better penetration testing

26
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,060
with uh

27
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,939
with code no code no code

28
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,780
hi everybody

29
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,420
I'm Kevin

30
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,399
I never know how to start these things

31
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,560
right it's like hey I'm Kevin I'm

32
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,520
[ __ ] awesome wait no I'm not oh

33
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,280
just so you know this talk is going to

34
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,919
be PG-13

35
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,840
I have not been diagnosed with

36
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,220
Tourette's

37
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,140
but we believe I have it both of my

38
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,360
daughters were diagnosed with Tourette's

39
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,000
I I told my oldest daughter when she got

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,440
the diagnosis that this was great

41
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,300
because she could yell [ __ ] at

42
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,280
any time and nobody could question it

43
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:30,180
so we're just starting out on the right

44
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,220
foot here

45
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,140
he said this is going to be a fun talk I

46
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,420
don't know for who uh gentlemen in the

47
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,459
back's already ready to boo you're

48
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:41,580
pretty awesome good good

49
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,860
so the idea here is I'm going to talk

50
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,720
about building better pen testing and

51
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,739
the reason I'm going to talk about

52
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:48,660
building better pen testing is because

53
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,480
we suck at it

54
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,239
I I am and I want to be very clear let

55
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,580
me many of you don't know me or many of

56
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,140
you know me and for those of you who

57
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,420
know me I'm sorry

58
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,760
um your life is worse because you've met

59
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,379
me

60
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:06,840
I'm actually an [ __ ] in court records

61
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,060
and it's not Divorce Court where I

62
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,519
assume that happens a lot I was called

63
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:12,840
an [ __ ] by the defense attorney

64
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,000
during a deposition

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,140
because he kept misquoting my report

66
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,760
to me

67
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,680
and then asking a question and I would

68
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,720
say that's not what I said because I had

69
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,220
my report in front of me and he would

70
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,500
say things like on page three paragraph

71
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,580
four you said no I didn't or the tenth

72
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,519
time he did it I finally said sir you

73
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,200
seem to be having trouble reading my

74
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,780
report would you like me to read it to

75
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,959
you

76
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:45,360
stop for a second like I always love it

77
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,099
when I'm in a deposition and I can make

78
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:50,220
the attorney speechless right like that

79
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,379
is one of my it's not an official goal

80
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:54,540
right like we don't work toward that but

81
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,400
I like it right and he stood and he

82
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,280
stared at me for a second and he goes

83
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,580
wow you really are an [ __ ] aren't you

84
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,080
and I didn't know what to say because I

85
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,980
was under oath so I said yes sir I am

86
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,019
so then like nine months later we went

87
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:12,000
to trial right I'm the expert witness

88
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,700
for this case and God it was a I really

89
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,560
believe that the defendants should have

90
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,040
been set on fire uh they were the people

91
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,600
you know those people that like call up

92
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,479
and say hi we're Windows sign up for our

93
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,520
service and we'll help you it was them

94
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,500
we were shutting companies like that

95
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,960
down right and so I get to the courtroom

96
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,940
and in this courtroom you swear in then

97
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,560
you walk past the judge and you sit down

98
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,840
and so I swore in walked past the judge

99
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,340
and judge went wait a minute

100
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:42,060
you're the [ __ ] aren't you and again

101
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,400
I didn't know what to do so I looked at

102
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,680
her and went yes your honor I am and

103
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,120
then I sat down and testified it was

104
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,979
crazy and that is what you're going to

105
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:51,900
talk about for the next hour we are

106
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,220
going to have a conversation about pen

107
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,540
testing and how we shouldn't be [ __ ]

108
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,660
and we should get better at what we do

109
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,540
I am Kevin Johnson I am a founder of

110
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,699
secure ideas which is a fancy way of

111
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:07,860
saying I'm the head nerd

112
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,139
we are a I always get a kick out of it

113
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:13,259
we are a boutique consulting firm I

114
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:15,000
somebody said that to me once I'm like

115
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,220
we don't sell flowers

116
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,660
because like I always heard of flower

117
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,460
boutiques right that was where I had

118
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,500
always heard that word so somebody else

119
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,080
came up with just recently and I giggled

120
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,699
hard enough that I'm going to repeat it

121
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:27,780
now

122
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,320
um we are a bespoke consulting firm

123
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,639
right uh we're not making new suits but

124
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,320
I am the founder of scary ideas we are a

125
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,720
security consulting firm in our focus is

126
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,180
pen testing I mean come on our slogan is

127
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,220
professionally evil right like that's

128
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,039
what we do we come in we break in we

129
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,380
tell you your baby is ugly and then we

130
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,580
go home and let's be honest

131
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:56,340
all babies are ugly until they're about

132
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,320
three months old they don't have

133
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,860
kneecaps their skull has holes in it

134
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,580
they're kind of squishy right we lie to

135
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,039
parents like oh your baby's so adorable

136
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:10,259
oh my God what happened to that kid did

137
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:13,139
they drop it I actually saw a kid once

138
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:16,740
his elbows were hairy I don't think

139
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,560
that's normal right like this is and

140
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,840
this is my job I get to go in and these

141
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,699
people have like slaved over this web

142
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:26,460
app that they've built for 27 years and

143
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,440
then I steal all this [ __ ] from it in

144
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,160
like 35 minutes and like hey we've

145
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,139
tested this one app

146
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:38,039
God some people are dumb right and sadly

147
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:40,500
you know that like the majority of

148
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,060
people in the world are average

149
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,880
intelligence or below because that's how

150
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,699
math works right

151
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,580
and they're building all of our stuff

152
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,440
I want to be very clear this is not a

153
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,900
developers or dumb talk because

154
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,199
developers aren't well okay some are

155
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:00,300
but some security people are dumb I'm

156
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,520
dumb right

157
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,759
we tell developers build stuff you have

158
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,800
a deadline that is way shorter than you

159
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,840
meant it to be like when I was a

160
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,220
developer my boss would say to me all

161
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,780
the time how long do you need to build

162
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,340
this and I'd be like six months if you

163
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,020
go you have two weeks I'm like why the

164
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,220
[ __ ] do you ask

165
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,020
what like

166
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,300
were you just making me feel like I was

167
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,099
part of the discussion oh we've already

168
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:25,680
sold it what we've also promised all the

169
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,280
features work well that's wrong but

170
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,680
we build stuff and now we're testing it

171
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,020
so I'm the security consultant guy I'm

172
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,300
the guy that has no stress because I get

173
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,039
to come in tell you it suck and leave I

174
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:40,199
have no responsibility I have no skin in

175
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,300
the game because we don't fix stuff we

176
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,860
don't we consider it a conflict of

177
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,360
interest I've never really understood

178
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,979
these companies who are like we'll pen

179
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:49,319
test you and then we'll sell you the

180
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:52,319
blinker fluid for your car afterwards

181
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,060
right like we'll fix it at the same time

182
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,280
that just seems wrong I'm also an ions

183
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,720
faculty member I'm an open source

184
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,419
fanatic I also like to wear Star Wars

185
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:02,580
costumes which saying it that way sounds

186
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,620
weird

187
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:08,460
um okay it is weird but we uh

188
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,560
we go and visit kids in the hospital and

189
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,139
stuff like that like the Vader up there

190
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:14,880
the big one not the little one the

191
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,340
little one's my kid that's me and they

192
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,220
brought 300 blind kids in and they had

193
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,960
them watch the Star Wars movies and then

194
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,759
we stood there for a few hours and let

195
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,120
the kids feel the costumes uh all of us

196
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,919
are crying in our helmets like that I

197
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:30,120
don't know another way to put it right

198
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,399
so that's what we do that's me if you

199
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,958
have questions about security if you

200
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,059
want to matter of fact we're hiring uh

201
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:37,919
if you want to talk about that we can go

202
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,779
here but I'm pointing all this out one

203
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:42,000
because like it's sales pitch time I

204
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,279
have to tell you how cool we are uh

205
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:48,120
something like that but the reality is

206
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,240
I am in an odd position

207
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,100
not only

208
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,399
have I been in the I.T field since 1991

209
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,260
because I'm old

210
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,940
I got my first job right out of high

211
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,339
school building code to help control the

212
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:03,720
power grid

213
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,459
which should scare the crap out of you

214
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:08,459
is that code is still running in some

215
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:12,240
Utilities in the United States today

216
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,940
I'm a shitty programmer now like let's

217
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,339
not even talk about how bad I was at 18

218
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:19,260
right

219
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,399
um

220
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,860
so I started in I.T and then I got into

221
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,500
security and I started doing ir and

222
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,080
instant forensics and Pen testing all

223
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,480
this kind of stuff and I've seen with

224
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,240
with the way security is works we try to

225
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,279
advise our customers I know I know I

226
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,260
know every used car salesman says I want

227
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,940
to be your best friend and then they

228
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,860
screw you over on interest rates or

229
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,880
something

230
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,740
um but we try to advise our customers

231
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,600
and so a lot of times we're actually

232
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,000
looking at pen test reports from other

233
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,380
companies

234
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,300
so that's an odd position for a pen

235
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,100
tester another part of the odd position

236
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,880
I'm in is I teach a lot so I you know I

237
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,800
used to teach and write courses for Sans

238
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,899
then I stopped doing that and I moved

239
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:02,459
over to doing it ourselves we work with

240
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:05,279
anti-siphon to push out code and classes

241
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,200
we got some amazing stuff coming next

242
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,240
year and because of this I actually

243
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,420
teach a lot of the people who do pen

244
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,640
testing right which I actually always

245
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,019
find it funny because

246
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:17,399
we give out our professional evil

247
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,560
stickers in class and they put it on

248
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,000
their work laptop and then they go do

249
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,339
pen tests on site at their customers and

250
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:24,899
then their customers call us the next

251
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:27,180
year it seems wrong

252
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,339
right how did you hear about us well our

253
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:31,320
pen testers last year had your logo on

254
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,940
their laptop so we thought we should

255
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,740
call you okay

256
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,200
um but because of this I see a lot of

257
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,440
pen testing okay I see it outside of my

258
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,000
organization and I also want to point

259
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,279
out that I'm talking about both internal

260
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:46,680
teams and third-party teams so pen

261
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,120
testing's been around for a while and

262
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,700
this is actually funny so I started for

263
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,279
this talk I actually did research that's

264
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,339
another way of saying I goggled it

265
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:58,800
um like you always people I researched

266
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,959
the vaccines I'm still mad I'm

267
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,480
vaccinated I'm boosted and my 5G signal

268
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,279
has not improved

269
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,600
they lied to me right but it's okay

270
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,640
October 10th it's all clotting or some

271
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,140
[ __ ] like that but recently they

272
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,860
started talking about but um so we we

273
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,360
looked it up

274
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,980
and they have been talking about

275
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,000
penetration testing as a term since the

276
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,760
60s I will also point out that was

277
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,300
before I was born I can say that the uh

278
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,339
other number up there was only a year

279
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:33,839
before I was born so I feel bad about

280
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,880
that one um if you don't want just

281
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,860
people discussing it but you want a

282
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,320
formal peer-reviewed paper stuff like

283
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,300
that you people with like degrees or

284
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,399
something probably prefer that

285
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,839
um they wrote the first paper that

286
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,060
mentioned it in 1972.

287
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,459
so let's go with the 1972 number mainly

288
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,440
because the math is easier

289
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,140
that was 50 years ago

290
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,420
50 years we have been talking about

291
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,980
penetration testing and when I talk

292
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,019
about penetration testing I'm talking of

293
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:03,360
computer equipment they were talking

294
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,000
about the computer equipment the network

295
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,120
and things like that in the 60s

296
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,980
for more than 50 years we've been

297
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,680
talking about pen testing and we still

298
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,760
today don't have a good answer for it we

299
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,620
don't know what we call it things like

300
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,899
that no it's gotten more popular in the

301
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:25,519
2000s right

302
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,240
I don't know how to math on slides

303
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,100
let me be very clear more than 30 years

304
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,959
ago is technically correct because 50 is

305
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,579
more than 30 years ago

306
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,480
nobody hires me for math

307
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,459
right but we've been doing it like

308
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:53,100
really really popular since 2000s I did

309
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,779
the mainframes or dead comment because

310
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:57,120
I've I'm starting to hear from people I

311
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,920
actually we do uh different meetings

312
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,899
with owners of companies we talk and

313
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:03,300
stuff like that and one of the guys is

314
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,060
constantly saying are you this pen

315
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,220
testing thing is going away right yeah I

316
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,500
like mainframes and passwords that I

317
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,180
loved that reference this morning right

318
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:16,079
oh yeah passwords are dead yeah [ __ ]

319
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,360
but

320
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,880
so we've been doing it forever and the

321
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,579
reality is we suck at it

322
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:26,339
and I say we suck at it

323
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:29,100
and not by the way not secure ideas we

324
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,579
don't suck

325
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,420
okay that's not true everybody sucks

326
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:37,320
number of times we 've come to me and

327
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,660
say I need a penetration test and then

328
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,980
they giggle because they're fifth grade

329
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,760
boys or something

330
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:46,740
and I can say that because I named my

331
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:51,540
open source project Samurai WTF but um

332
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:55,579
stands for web training framework honest

333
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,399
we

334
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,180
we treat

335
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,620
as a game

336
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,019
or a contest how many people here have

337
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:09,180
heard a penetration tester myself

338
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,500
included

339
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,440
say things like yep we got domain admin

340
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,060
we win

341
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,560
right

342
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,380
here yeah I go to Defcon I go to gercon

343
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,300
I go to well I don't go to show me con

344
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,880
anymore because those jerks closed it

345
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,080
down

346
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,980
[Laughter]

347
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,959
so we listen to speakers right we talk

348
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,579
about nobody ever talks about well

349
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:34,139
that's not true it's getting better but

350
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:37,320
very rarely do we hear talks about this

351
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,720
is what we failed at doing

352
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,959
these are the controls that kept us out

353
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,420
no we hear stupid stories like I broke

354
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,459
into the wrong Bank

355
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:50,760
I flew a plane sideways

356
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,199
right

357
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:55,019
these are the talks we put Kevin mitnick

358
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:58,079
on stage on a regular basis

359
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,320
you mean a guy who is an Unapologetic

360
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,480
convicted felon and I want to be very

361
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,740
clear I don't have any problems with

362
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,019
convicted felons I really don't I

363
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:09,060
believe if you've served your time we

364
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,740
should absolutely now there's our

365
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,240
exceptions to this right we want to talk

366
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,339
about sexual crimes rape murder things

367
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:15,660
like that that's different conversation

368
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,639
but if you've served your time in my

369
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:19,800
opinion you're good

370
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,880
you did something bad you got caught you

371
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,440
served time

372
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,920
you're fine now okay but Kevin mitnick

373
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,660
regularly gets up on stage and says well

374
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,920
it's illegal but I don't think it was

375
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,139
wrong for me to do what I did

376
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:36,180
he works for a company he formed a

377
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,560
company that is well known for

378
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,380
plagiarizing content right this is we'll

379
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,959
talk about this in a second

380
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,639
many people think I'd look like Kevin

381
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,860
mitnick I regularly get asked to sign

382
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,079
his book

383
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:51,600
so I do

384
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,579
I signed it Kevin Johnson because I

385
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:55,560
don't lie

386
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,600
I actually have an eBay alert looking

387
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,399
for signed copies of his book because

388
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:00,779
I'm waiting to find out how much

389
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:02,579
somebody would pay for a Kevin mitnick

390
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:05,160
book signed by Kevin Johnson

391
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,040
one hasn't hit hey bay yet

392
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,320
but we go out there and we don't have a

393
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,240
good definition right and I want to be

394
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,040
very clear we actually have a great

395
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,220
definition a penetration test is a

396
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,779
security assessment where you try to

397
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:20,699
exploit vulnerabilities

398
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:22,139
if you don't try to exploit

399
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:24,660
vulnerabilities it's not a pen test

400
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,459
if you run nessus against a whole bunch

401
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:29,399
of targets and stop that's not a pen

402
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:31,560
test

403
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:35,820
nothing against nessus but it's not

404
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,560
and people say well what happens if you

405
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,420
don't actually exploit anything I said

406
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,180
so you failed at exploitation yes still

407
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,920
a pen test

408
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,259
right because you tried no I would ask

409
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:49,139
why didn't you succeed why did you not

410
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:51,240
find something else why did you not same

411
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,639
thing though I'll go another pies

412
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:56,519
I did a pen test I got in I got domain

413
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:58,980
admin okay what did you do next I wrote

414
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,560
a report that's not a pen test in my

415
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,759
opinion

416
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:06,000
that's a capture the flag

417
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,919
and there are places for capture the

418
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,179
flags

419
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:11,280
but they're not pen tests

420
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,980
my job as a penetration tester is to

421
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:17,400
find as many flaws as I can find in the

422
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,500
time frame I've got within the scope of

423
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,660
what I've got and verify that they're

424
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:25,439
real and evaluate the risk

425
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,579
that's my job

426
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,840
and if you can't say you're doing that

427
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,059
you're not really doing pen testing

428
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:34,620
and you're damn straight not helping

429
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,299
your customer

430
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:39,360
hey I broke in I got to my admin yes

431
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,179
your passwords suck your password is

432
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:45,419
winter 2022.

433
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,940
it almost got me because it hasn't been

434
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,660
fall yet

435
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:55,260
you know when your password for the

436
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,720
domain admin account is the name of your

437
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,320
company but capitalized incorrectly

438
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,320
that's not a strong password

439
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,260
real example

440
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:10,020
right if we didn't get domain admin and

441
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,860
I stop I haven't done

442
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,660
I haven't helped my customer what does

443
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,820
the customer know the customer now knows

444
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,740
Kevin has domain admin

445
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,720
what did I help

446
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,160
what did I

447
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,039
did I improve their security I always

448
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:28,740
loved there's a security consulting firm

449
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,660
that used to use the slogan I think

450
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,220
they've they've been bought or shut down

451
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,480
or something like that but they used to

452
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,220
use the slogan

453
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:38,220
helping improve your security by hacking

454
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,080
you

455
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,400
don't actually improve your security

456
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,020
when you when we're done with the pen

457
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,360
test you have no better security than

458
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,260
when you started the pen test

459
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,900
unless you change the things I found

460
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,400
right so we have to have a good

461
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,559
definition right that's one thing the

462
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:57,600
other thing we have is we have a lot of

463
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,580
gatekeeping and I don't mean I want to

464
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,520
be very clear I acknowledge the fact

465
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,240
that I'm a straight fat white guy

466
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,260
I am absolutely the epitome of I don't

467
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,960
[ __ ] understand stuff

468
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,940
the only way you could make me more of a

469
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:18,679
stereotype is to name me Karen

470
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,760
but what I see is so many people are

471
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,559
like I just saw it I just saw it this

472
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:27,360
morning and I read it and I almost

473
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,360
responded to the Jack hole I did respond

474
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,059
to him but I almost responded with thank

475
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:35,700
you I needed more to cover this

476
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,080
afternoon when I'm it's not the

477
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,760
afternoon Tim it's morning but I

478
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,960
actually almost wrote to this guy and

479
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,460
say I wanted to screenshot his stuff

480
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:44,640
John strand who is awesome and I'm

481
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,380
talking about the security guy not the

482
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,940
underwear model who performed

483
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,820
Insurrection by invading the capital

484
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,419
um

485
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:54,000
because that John strand is now first in

486
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,220
Google

487
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,799
so John's fan of Black Hills tweeted out

488
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,120
I don't know a week ago or something

489
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,400
like that and he's like hey if you work

490
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,880
for a big company go to your HR company

491
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,020
HR Group and get your HR Group to start

492
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:12,480
adding instead of college degree

493
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,860
required and I want to be very clear I'm

494
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,660
not making fun of college degrees I'm

495
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,580
just too stupid to get one

496
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:21,000
I barely made it through High School

497
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,700
there are teachers in my high school

498
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,400
that are now thinking to themselves that

499
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,919
they were stupid because they thought I

500
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:33,260
was a [ __ ] they were right

501
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:37,620
but John said please stop making it a

502
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:41,700
requirement to have a degree alone

503
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:46,200
please add things like uh ctfs and

504
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,260
experience and internally add that so if

505
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:52,140
I don't have a degree but I went through

506
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,480
meta CTF and I did all this training and

507
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,100
I showed I did a whole bunch of bug

508
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,700
Bounty programs and I showed experience

509
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:02,360
let's have that be equivalent not not

510
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,500
equivalent like oh yeah you have a

511
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,380
doctorate and I got in the top 4 000 on

512
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,720
bug crowd or some crap like that right

513
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,520
that's not what we're saying but we're

514
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,860
saying like let people in and this dude

515
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,380
he responds with

516
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,480
so you're telling me

517
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,320
you expect me to work with people who

518
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,020
don't have degrees and treat them the

519
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,059
same way as me who went through a

520
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:29,600
foreign

521
00:21:29,659 --> 00:21:32,640
yeah Boo's the right word do you know

522
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,200
who has a degree

523
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,280
Dr Oz

524
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:40,260
and I believe that recently he said that

525
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,820
you can improve the gas mileage of your

526
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:45,179
car by shoving strawberries up your ass

527
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,520
I might have made that up

528
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,140
but here's the best part you actually

529
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,640
had to think about did Kevin make that

530
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,500
up or did Dr Oz actually say that

531
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,980
and I don't care your politics but have

532
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,539
you seen some of the lawyers who have

533
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:03,120
worked for Trump

534
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,159
they had a press conference in front of

535
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:08,240
a landscaping company

536
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,320
and again I'm not making fun of your

537
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,120
poly whoever you support you support

538
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,799
whatever

539
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:17,039
a landscaping company they have college

540
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,520
degrees

541
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,159
that's the gatekeeping I'm talking about

542
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:25,260
what's the average cost of a cyber

543
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,760
security training program

544
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,159
I'll break it to you it's over five

545
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:31,440
thousand dollars for one class

546
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,900
that's average and considering the fact

547
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,419
that my CIS mentorship

548
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:39,419
is free if you want it to be free you

549
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:40,860
can imagine with the top end of those

550
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,179
numbers are

551
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:44,460
I was just talking to a trainer and he

552
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,080
does corporate training

553
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,620
and he was complaining

554
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,200
that an organization wasn't willing to

555
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,480
give him his hundred and forty three

556
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,659
thousand dollar three-day training fee

557
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,140
I wanted to know why it wasn't just

558
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:07,500
145. like what was it about the three

559
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:12,360
but my cost is 142 987 and 16 cents

560
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,700
right like he was coming like that's so

561
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,200
ridiculous that they won't pay me over a

562
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,460
hundred thousand dollars I'm like how

563
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:20,220
long is your class three days

564
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:23,520
but it's an intense three days

565
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,140
right

566
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,720
that's what we got

567
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,580
that's how we handle it we're like oh

568
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,500
for you to be a pen tester you must have

569
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,720
your oscp how many people here have

570
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,520
their oscp

571
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,380
you know what that tells me you tried

572
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,919
harder

573
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,159
and I think the oscp is actually kind of

574
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,860
cool Hands-On lab it gives you

575
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,140
information that's cool

576
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,840
but do you know the last time I wrote a

577
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,539
custom Beaufort buffer those Beaufort

578
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:56,880
overflows

579
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,320
that's when they're in Ruby

580
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,419
somebody's going to say Kevin you know

581
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:04,799
Ruby doesn't have access to memory like

582
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,659
[ __ ] yeah I know that it was a joke

583
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:09,360
about the pronunciation

584
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,340
Ruby the language that you are

585
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,500
guaranteed never to have the environment

586
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,780
work if you are supporting two different

587
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,620
code bases

588
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,320
the library it's miserable

589
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,260
the oscp I never write custom buffer

590
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,659
overflows during my pen test

591
00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:29,460
why

592
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:32,940
because for 99 of my customers because

593
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,280
it's we do them for some customers

594
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,559
that's useless hey I found a

595
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,419
vulnerability in your system I built an

596
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:41,940
exploit for it how do we fix it oh man I

597
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:45,000
don't know because I just found it

598
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,580
right Did we tell the vendor no I have a

599
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,960
non-disclosure agreement I'm not allowed

600
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,640
to tell the vendor

601
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,140
right

602
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,760
is that really teaching people how to

603
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,919
pen test we have kids that are coming

604
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,020
out of college

605
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:01,080
I actually interviewed these kids coming

606
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,000
out of college these people had they

607
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,940
were in the postgraduate program

608
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,500
and if I understand it correctly that

609
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,940
means they had the four-year degree and

610
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,679
they were going for their masters you

611
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:11,940
people who actually went to college can

612
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,740
correct me if I'm wrong and I

613
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:16,140
interviewed them to come in and do I we

614
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,640
called it an internship but it wasn't

615
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,080
really it was an internship it was more

616
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,400
advanced than that it was higher up in

617
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,720
that it was really just a step into

618
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,760
becoming a consultant and I actually

619
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,539
asked multiple students

620
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:29,760
what operating systems are you familiar

621
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,480
with working with

622
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:36,200
one of them said SSH

623
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,779
and I said no no not how you connect to

624
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:41,640
the system what is the operating system

625
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,039
you're connecting to it too and the guy

626
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:48,600
said SSH like saying it to me again was

627
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,600
going to change my reaction

628
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,640
and I feel bad because I don't want to

629
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,960
be gatekeeping myself I'm complaining

630
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,419
about gatekeeping but this guy and there

631
00:25:57,419 --> 00:25:58,620
were multiple of them in this interview

632
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:01,740
process one person the operating system

633
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,500
they were most familiar with was office

634
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:07,260
365. I will acknowledge that's closer

635
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,919
than SSH

636
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,679
that's the college education these

637
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,240
people are getting

638
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,059
like that's a problem right so we need

639
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:20,179
to make it better and in my opinion

640
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:23,520
these are the three main things we have

641
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,140
to fix

642
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,000
and I'm not going to Spanish and

643
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,620
position this and come up with a fourth

644
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,440
one because I've already written slides

645
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,360
but we've got a problem with quality

646
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,039
validation and understanding those are

647
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,779
them so let's look into each of these

648
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:38,279
three things I really should have

649
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:39,960
remembered my Clicker

650
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,580
and no I'm not going to borrow one if

651
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,659
somebody has one because I'm not

652
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:45,779
plugging USB from you into my laptop but

653
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:47,880
thank you very much I always feel bad

654
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,440
when people come up like hey here you go

655
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,140
I'm like yeah thanks don't you trust me

656
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,400
no

657
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,659
oh

658
00:26:54,659 --> 00:26:57,600
it's like it's my job not to trust you

659
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,760
so the first thing is quality

660
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,460
right we see this one all the time I

661
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,520
Maize how many people here are on Reddit

662
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,120
Reddit is

663
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:13,140
and scary as hell

664
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,600
one of my favorite subreddits I think

665
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,760
that's what they're called

666
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,480
is uh the pen testing one

667
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,940
and I I troll that no I'm I'm sorry I

668
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,279
idle there I'm not trolling I'm not that

669
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:29,159
kind of okay I troll there and uh the

670
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:32,279
number of times people are like hey

671
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:35,159
I'm doing a pen test

672
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:41,179
and I don't understand what nmap is

673
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,620
no I want to be very clear I'm glad

674
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,559
they're asking I really am I'm thrilled

675
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,240
they're asking

676
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,539
but at that point you're not ready to do

677
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:54,840
a pen test not by yourself

678
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,640
right

679
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,520
what I want to know is how did you not

680
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,140
you because somebody else sold your

681
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,220
service

682
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,559
somebody else convinced somebody to pay

683
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,260
money for you to learn nmap on their

684
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,820
systems

685
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,020
right

686
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,299
and my question is

687
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:15,179
why is that okay as an industry

688
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:16,980
I'm not questioning that person's ethics

689
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,900
I really am not

690
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,640
and I always hate the term ethical

691
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,220
hacker it's such a stupid [ __ ] term

692
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,559
I'm an ethical hacker really all hackers

693
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:27,000
are ethical

694
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,640
ethics are personal

695
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,740
that dude's ethics said he could rob a

696
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,919
bank

697
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:37,440
mine don't

698
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,480
we're both ethical hacker or they go

699
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,460
like are you a white hat I don't wear

700
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,880
hats

701
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,960
why do we get that like white hat gray

702
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,360
hat black hat like oh man stupid never

703
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,340
mind but so we have a quality problem

704
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,960
right how many people here have seen the

705
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,840
websites 500 bucks will pen test your

706
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,700
whole organization

707
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,440
500 bucks

708
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,860
500 bucks I'll give you an idea secure

709
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:05,159
ideas is retail rate is 300 an hour

710
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:07,799
that's what we built 300 an hour that's

711
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:09,419
on our website we have our pricing on

712
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:12,179
our website we're one of the few bespoke

713
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:14,940
consulting firms that do that why

714
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:15,840
because we want to share information

715
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,020
right we want to share everything

716
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,940
for 500 bucks

717
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:24,120
you got an hour and two-thirds from one

718
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,260
of my people

719
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,419
do you know how much we can pen test you

720
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:30,000
not much and we're good don't get me

721
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,440
wrong

722
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,679
Jason got domain admin on a network

723
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:38,100
through a web app on the internet on the

724
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:41,059
first day of the test

725
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,740
notice I said first day because he went

726
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,899
and did all the other stuff too

727
00:29:45,899 --> 00:29:49,080
from the Internet domain admin

728
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,880
why because he understood how the system

729
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,880
worked that took more than an hour and

730
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,020
two-thirds

731
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,460
right

732
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,740
so we have a quality problem we also

733
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,919
have an issue with scope

734
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:03,840
and to me the scope problem is an

735
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,399
experience problem how many people here

736
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:07,140
have done a pen test where they were

737
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:10,020
told we have penetration tests for

738
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:13,220
clients reasons right PCI requires it

739
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:16,500
glba requires it HIPAA spelled with two

740
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,020
P's not one p the correct way because we

741
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,799
don't [ __ ] know

742
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,380
and I blame Blue Cross for that

743
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,659
when I worked at Blue Cross of Florida I

744
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,520
was part of the project implementing

745
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,860
HIPAA controls and the logo they used

746
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,679
for it was a hippo

747
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:36,600
and every time I saw it I'm like guys

748
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,679
you just are going to make people

749
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,360
misspell that

750
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,860
sure enough that's why I blame Blue

751
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,919
Cross oh it's all their fault

752
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,140
but we get Scopes like okay we would

753
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,580
like you to pen test us it's very

754
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,080
important to test our entire

755
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,320
comprehensive security program great so

756
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,539
everything's in scope oh God no

757
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,580
got three IP addresses

758
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:02,279
they're behind cloudflare

759
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:05,360
test those

760
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:08,779
by the way two of them were

761
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,860
or we had one company come to us they're

762
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,360
like we need a patent desk we have this

763
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,399
application people are buying it they're

764
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,620
requiring a pen test great awesome so

765
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,960
we're going to test the application yes

766
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,559
okay

767
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,480
start going around we get user IDs

768
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,679
because we're going to do different

769
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,299
roles test it good everything sounds

770
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:29,039
good so far right everything sounds good

771
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:33,480
okay cool you're allowed to test the app

772
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,640
from 2 am

773
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,980
to 4 A.M

774
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,980
Tuesday Thursday

775
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,960
and Saturday

776
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,340
I'm not making up that scope

777
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,480
unsurprisingly those were their three

778
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,419
change Windows where they turned off the

779
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:52,679
app

780
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:54,960
to do updates and maintenance and things

781
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,220
like that

782
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,840
so when they said that to us let me be

783
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,760
very clear we did not do that test we're

784
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,039
like no

785
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:04,200
I always love it like you can test all

786
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,700
my stuff we'll accept those servers over

787
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,960
there why can't we test those servers

788
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,460
over there they're vulnerable what are

789
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,220
they vulnerable to everything

790
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,559
what do those servers hold all of our

791
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:15,779
stuff

792
00:32:15,779 --> 00:32:18,240
we had one company get mad at us because

793
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,000
we could see the guest password for

794
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,279
their wireless network from the parking

795
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:24,360
lot

796
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,700
so we signed in and then found out that

797
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,820
their captive portal pretended to be on

798
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:32,340
a VLAN so we had access to all of their

799
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:35,899
internal Network right

800
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,980
then they tried to tell us the parking

801
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:41,000
lot was out of scope

802
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,360
right so have this problem and then we

803
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,460
have the problem with communication

804
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,440
how many people do a pen test once a

805
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,159
year

806
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,679
right most companies that do pen testing

807
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,659
do it once a year how often do they do

808
00:32:54,659 --> 00:32:56,100
talk to the security people the rest of

809
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,299
the year

810
00:32:57,299 --> 00:32:59,340
right I love when people call me up and

811
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:02,820
they're like hey it's December 27th

812
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,940
you're right and it's funny most of them

813
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,980
actually start the conversation with the

814
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:10,260
date as if I don't have a watch and a

815
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:13,019
calendar and a sense of time

816
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:16,399
hello who are you oh

817
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:20,279
I'm the CSO of blah blah blah

818
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:23,100
and it turns out our Auditors meant it

819
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,080
when they said we needed an annual pen

820
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,340
test

821
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:30,299
oh okay so when's your fiscal year end

822
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:33,179
the 31st

823
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:36,240
okay can you have a pen test done by the

824
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,640
end of the year no

825
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,559
I can have it started by the end of the

826
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,840
year we start lots of pen tests between

827
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:47,000
the 26th and the 31st

828
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,440
on that year

829
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,120
and then I deliver them we have

830
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,700
customers that we reach out to sometime

831
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,860
in June and say you remember last year

832
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,240
when you called me in December and said

833
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,640
oh my God I need a pet dance

834
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,860
yeah I remember that you want to arrange

835
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:04,320
that earlier no I don't think they mean

836
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,720
it this year okay I'll talk to you in a

837
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,540
couple months and um

838
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,339
we don't talk to people we do pen tests

839
00:34:11,339 --> 00:34:13,379
I've actually talked to customers that

840
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:16,260
have had another pen test firm worked

841
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,580
with them the year before and they're

842
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,918
amazed at how often we reach out to them

843
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:22,260
during the pen test

844
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,820
they're amazed when we ask them

845
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:26,940
questions like hey I just did this thing

846
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,820
did you notice

847
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,619
why do you care because I want to write

848
00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:32,760
in the report that you're doing good

849
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,320
monitoring and logging and alerting

850
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,119
unless you didn't notice and then I want

851
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:37,679
to write in the report that you suck at

852
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,139
monitoring and logging and alerting

853
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:41,159
thank you

854
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,780
wait you're gonna tell me when you do

855
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,280
stuff yes I'm going to tell you when you

856
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,139
do stuff because I want you to be able

857
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:48,899
to see the other side of it

858
00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:50,399
because we want to have a partnership

859
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,679
with our customers and by the way if

860
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:54,239
you're not a third party pen tester you

861
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,859
work for a company you still have

862
00:34:55,859 --> 00:34:57,300
customers

863
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,859
they just happen to get a paycheck from

864
00:34:58,859 --> 00:35:02,180
the same company you do

865
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,760
we need to be better at talking to

866
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,980
people we need to be better at

867
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,720
explaining how we do it we need to be a

868
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,300
better at understanding our own tooling

869
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,339
what was it hard play yeah it was hard

870
00:35:14,339 --> 00:35:15,660
play

871
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,640
a number of years after heartblade was

872
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,339
out I get an email from some doof on the

873
00:35:20,339 --> 00:35:22,260
internet

874
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,760
and it says

875
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,980
Mr Johnson

876
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:29,940
your company is vulnerable to heartblade

877
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,800
and my I'll admit it my first thought

878
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,500
was [ __ ] what did we miss

879
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,780
right because I'm very firm believer

880
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,339
that if we've screwed something up it

881
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:40,260
was probably me right we'll start with

882
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,300
us I start with troubleshooting on my

883
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,940
own side because I know I can fix the

884
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,680
stuff I broke

885
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,540
if I troubleshoot and find out it was

886
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:51,960
wolf I gotta convince him to fix it and

887
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,660
he's so focused on toasters and I'm

888
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,880
using a microwave oven and he doesn't

889
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,820
even know what to do with that

890
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:03,599
and so I'd rather it be me so internally

891
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,579
I'm like people

892
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:08,460
look are we really like did we forget a

893
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,260
system did we stay like we stand up

894
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,240
vulnerable systems for classes did we

895
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,220
[ __ ] up and put it in the wrong place or

896
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,900
like what do we do at the same time I

897
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,240
wrote back to the person I'm like hey uh

898
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,220
thanks for write me uh could you give me

899
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,140
a little more detail you know like that

900
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,960
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah your main website

901
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,540
is vulnerable to heartblade now at that

902
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:31,040
point I'm like no it's not

903
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,780
so I wrote back to the guy I'm like I

904
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,400
don't I mean I don't mean to argue with

905
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,180
you

906
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:38,280
not going to argue with you but could

907
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,079
you explain why you think so and he sent

908
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:42,599
me back a screenshot of nmap you know

909
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:44,940
what map has a scripting engine he ran

910
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,880
and map against our production website

911
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,640
and he ran the script to check for

912
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,960
heartblade

913
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,480
and the result said not vulnerable to

914
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,680
heartblade

915
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,960
but he ran it in debug mode

916
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:02,040
so it printed the TLs handshake you know

917
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:06,000
like to the output and he ignored where

918
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,800
it said not vulnerable to Heartbleed and

919
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,040
decided that the debug mode was

920
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,220
a vulnerable part of our plate and so I

921
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:18,540
got to explain to this random french guy

922
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,220
um he was from France not that that

923
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,320
matters but

924
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,339
um

925
00:37:23,339 --> 00:37:26,280
he gave up but um

926
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:30,000
how debug mode works in nmap I also had

927
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,900
to explain to them that we don't have a

928
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,160
bug Bounty program and he didn't have

929
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,480
permission to test our systems and he

930
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,320
probably shouldn't have done that but

931
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,760
that's a different conversation

932
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,280
he didn't understand his own tools

933
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,800
right and I see that constantly I ran

934
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,380
this I wanted to do this right

935
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,960
it's it's ridiculous

936
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,420
the next thing we see validation this is

937
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,339
a big one

938
00:37:50,339 --> 00:37:52,140
you do a test how many false negatives

939
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:54,740
do you find

940
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:57,119
none that we know of is the correct

941
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,560
answer

942
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,420
because if it's a false negative you

943
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,820
don't know it's vulnerable

944
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:06,420
right how many false positives those are

945
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,119
my favorite

946
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:12,060
You're vulnerable to what to this you

947
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:14,160
sure I don't know nessus told me you

948
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,900
were

949
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:19,140
it was in Orange Orange scares me

950
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:23,180
mostly because of pumpkin spice

951
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:25,800
I don't know why that scares me it's

952
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,940
just it's not that good but

953
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:32,220
we look at things we test it right how

954
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:34,680
many people here use burp

955
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,320
yeah how many people here use burp's

956
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,920
passive scanner to tell you when a Dom

957
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,440
based redirect exists in the JavaScript

958
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,599
code right

959
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,640
I can't be the only one people the

960
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,880
passive scanner works well right okay so

961
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,859
here's the problem I have been using

962
00:38:52,859 --> 00:38:54,480
their passive scanner for somewhere

963
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,380
around 75 years might be exaggerating

964
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:02,760
I think I have found a single time that

965
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,480
burp correctly identified a Dom based

966
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,400
redirect

967
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,500
using passive scanning I will

968
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,940
acknowledge the fact that that one time

969
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:14,640
was in their web Academy where they were

970
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,280
teaching Dom based attacks so I'm glad

971
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,320
it found it right and I'm not making fun

972
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,839
of the tool right that's a very

973
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,480
difficult thing for an automated tool to

974
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,380
detect I would rather burp give me false

975
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,839
positives because my job is to look at

976
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:32,760
that and understand what's going on and

977
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,740
evaluate it right here's the problem

978
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,720
tons of people just take that from put

979
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,800
in the report

980
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,780
oh it must be vulnerable burp says it

981
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,820
and how could you not trust something

982
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:44,300
called the burp

983
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:47,099
the only tool you'd trust more is one

984
00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:49,640
called fart

985
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,079
you know I'm right this is the only

986
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:53,700
industry that you can go in front of the

987
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,920
CEO or like send it and talk about

988
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,640
things like burp vomit Fu right and

989
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,099
those are all legitimate tool names

990
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:06,020
what did you say to me I said fu

991
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,540
but we look at this stuff so false

992
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,859
positives are bad

993
00:40:10,859 --> 00:40:12,839
but we also have false negatives and in

994
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:16,140
my my experience most false negatives

995
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,960
are because the person testing doesn't

996
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,180
actually understand the system they're

997
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,200
testing

998
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,880
right

999
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:27,300
I was following up on an auditor we do a

1000
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,740
lot of work where Auditors will bring us

1001
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,599
in we do the technical assessment they

1002
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:32,400
do the other stuff but I was actually

1003
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,520
following up on an audit that failed

1004
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,099
um they were doing um it doesn't matter

1005
00:40:38,099 --> 00:40:39,900
I realized I can't anonymize it enough

1006
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,599
they did an audit it wasn't accepted

1007
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:44,339
they brought in a different audit firm

1008
00:40:44,339 --> 00:40:46,800
so we're looking at stuff and and what

1009
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,180
we found

1010
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:51,960
was that when you port scanned this

1011
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,859
system it fell over

1012
00:40:54,859 --> 00:40:58,560
okay but it happens right

1013
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,000
um so we were poking and prodding and we

1014
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,280
found massive vulnerabilities

1015
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,260
and we talked now we're following up on

1016
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:06,240
a failed audit right so we're talking to

1017
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,560
the customer about the previous audit

1018
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,839
the previous auditor had actually told

1019
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:14,099
them that that server had zero risks

1020
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:16,800
so they dug into the work product and

1021
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,480
what it turned out was they would port

1022
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,000
scan first asset Discovery right let's

1023
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,859
see what's out there let's let's the

1024
00:41:22,859 --> 00:41:25,560
system would fall over they would not

1025
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,900
notice that it was there for the initial

1026
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,000
start of the port scan and not there at

1027
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,520
the end of the port scan and then they

1028
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:35,160
would run a vulner scan against the IP

1029
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,680
addresses she wasn't listening anymore

1030
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,380
because it was still rebooting and it

1031
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,900
found zero vulnerabilities on a host it

1032
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,700
couldn't connect to

1033
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:47,359
right

1034
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:50,460
that's a false negative

1035
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,980
we were working with a website that had

1036
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:55,740
that cool you remember the hacker safe

1037
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:58,140
sticker that was on websites and they'd

1038
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,119
be like what is it McAfee secure bought

1039
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:02,339
it and like they would scan your website

1040
00:42:02,339 --> 00:42:04,560
every day and give you a little oh

1041
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,440
you're secure hacker safe this is

1042
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,780
awesome so I was testing the site and

1043
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,640
we're just trashing this site we're

1044
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,740
pulling phones out we're dumping data

1045
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:16,740
we're like poking around we actually a

1046
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,420
number of times through the test stopped

1047
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:20,460
called the customer and said look

1048
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:23,820
can we stop because

1049
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:27,960
this all sucks like you're so bad we

1050
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,060
can't get a control to block us right

1051
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:32,339
like we're throwing SQL injection flaws

1052
00:42:32,339 --> 00:42:33,540
and the ldap server's like you're

1053
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:34,859
getting me next I might as well dump

1054
00:42:34,859 --> 00:42:37,320
stuff to you now right like it was just

1055
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,060
awful

1056
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,320
and they're like Kevin I don't

1057
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,839
understand it uh McAfee tells us our

1058
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:45,359
website is completely secure

1059
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:48,960
I'm like well okay so we looked at it

1060
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,880
because they wanted to know why turned

1061
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,579
out they were name-based hosted right so

1062
00:42:53,579 --> 00:42:54,920
when you hit

1063
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,540
www.secureideas.com the server went oh

1064
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:00,060
that's this stuff here right

1065
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:02,220
um and they had told McAfee to scan

1066
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,200
their IP address

1067
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,960
so they were getting the Apache it works

1068
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,819
page

1069
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:10,680
and that wasn't vulnerable to any

1070
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,420
attacks

1071
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,640
that's a false negative

1072
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,160
right because guess what the it works

1073
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:20,099
page has no Dynamic content or

1074
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:23,160
parameters to attack

1075
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,900
100

1076
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,520
that's not true we could probably find a

1077
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,780
vulnerability in it but let's just go

1078
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,700
with it right it's like Oracle

1079
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:32,579
Unbreakable

1080
00:43:32,579 --> 00:43:36,599
the next one is thresholds let's be very

1081
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:38,220
clear when we do a pen test very often

1082
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:39,660
we're not subtle

1083
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,400
you might not know this about me but I'm

1084
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,800
not a subtle person

1085
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:47,880
we're like and we hack stuff

1086
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,619
because what we're being asked to is

1087
00:43:49,619 --> 00:43:51,359
find all the vulnerabilities

1088
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:53,099
but now here's a question I found you I

1089
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:55,020
found a Brute Force attack I can Brute

1090
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:57,839
Force these accounts did you notice

1091
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:00,180
yes Kevin when you attempted 10 million

1092
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,040
attempts against that server we saw it

1093
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,900
okay great so I tried 10 million

1094
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,700
attempts with two seconds between them

1095
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,500
that's an exaggeration let's go with

1096
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,960
that but right and then they stopped

1097
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,220
noticing

1098
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:13,140
because the two second threshold was

1099
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:14,640
enough of a time for their monitoring

1100
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,619
not to catch it

1101
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:18,119
did you test that in the pen test you

1102
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:20,880
did because I did

1103
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,819
you test to see that they unlock locked

1104
00:44:23,819 --> 00:44:26,880
accounts 37 seconds later

1105
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,180
right do you know that when you send a

1106
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:32,220
whole bunch of payloads at a system and

1107
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:35,940
you get 500 errors back 500 status code

1108
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:39,200
errors not 500 of them

1109
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:43,800
that as long as you only get 500 as long

1110
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:47,960
as you only get 2500 area

1111
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:54,540
as long as you only get 20 errors in a

1112
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:57,720
30-minute period their alerting ignores

1113
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:58,740
it

1114
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:00,839
the minute you go over 20 errors in a 30

1115
00:45:00,839 --> 00:45:03,060
minute period they alert like crazy

1116
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:04,859
those are the thresholds we should be

1117
00:45:04,859 --> 00:45:07,200
measuring for when we do pen tests right

1118
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,599
because the attackers I have a week I

1119
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:11,460
have two weeks I have a month the

1120
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:13,440
attackers have forever and I'm not

1121
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,760
saying that like oh my God they're going

1122
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,160
to get in because they have forever I'm

1123
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,859
saying we should be in the time that we

1124
00:45:19,859 --> 00:45:22,740
have of valuating the actual thresholds

1125
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:24,720
that you have so that you can better

1126
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:28,440
tune them to your risk level

1127
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:31,260
so you can get a better idea of what's

1128
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:34,140
going on and what you need to handle

1129
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:36,780
and then the last topic is understanding

1130
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:38,819
and this is the big one

1131
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:42,240
my God people don't understand [ __ ]

1132
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,520
the biggest one I find right I see cyber

1133
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:47,099
risks everywhere

1134
00:45:47,099 --> 00:45:49,260
most people don't even notice cyber risk

1135
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:50,880
is

1136
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,859
I was in Oklahoma and I think Oklahoma's

1137
00:45:52,859 --> 00:45:54,780
best way to play is this because of well

1138
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:56,339
I'll explain it in a second

1139
00:45:56,339 --> 00:45:58,260
and I was speaking and I asked the

1140
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:00,900
audience how many of you are actively

1141
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:03,119
afraid of sharks ask here how many of

1142
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:05,520
you are afraid of sharks

1143
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,440
I got a few people raising their hands

1144
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,839
are you actively afraid of sharks like

1145
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:12,900
oh man okay good he said no that's good

1146
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:15,240
answer right the people in this audience

1147
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,460
like yes like you're actively like you

1148
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:19,140
could get bitten by a shark right now

1149
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:20,700
well not right now but I'm really

1150
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,260
worried about it

1151
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:25,640
you're in a landlocked state

1152
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:28,260
the only way somebody in Oklahoma is

1153
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:30,780
shark is if they're transporting one

1154
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:33,420
from one aquarium to another and they

1155
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:36,480
run their truck into it

1156
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,640
you know what you should be afraid of

1157
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:42,240
cows and soda machines

1158
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:46,260
Undead serious cows will [ __ ] you up

1159
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:48,740
people like oh they're so adorable

1160
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:53,180
yeah go try tipping that bastard

1161
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,640
more people die every year

1162
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,560
in the U.S

1163
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,319
from cow attacks

1164
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:04,619
and soda machines individually

1165
00:47:04,619 --> 00:47:06,720
not together

1166
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:12,300
then die worldwide from shark attacks

1167
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,280
why that is

1168
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,319
people [ __ ] with cows

1169
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:18,900
and they steal sodas

1170
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:21,119
and they literally will pull the soda

1171
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:22,980
machine down on top of themselves and it

1172
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:25,020
will crush them because they're stealing

1173
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:26,099
soda

1174
00:47:26,099 --> 00:47:28,920
right but Discovery Channel doesn't have

1175
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:31,880
a Pepsi week

1176
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,260
that's probably because of Pepsi Pepsi

1177
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:36,420
is like no we don't want people afraid

1178
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:37,920
of us

1179
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,800
cow week

1180
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,700
Daisy was pissed right I don't know

1181
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,680
Daisy's a cow name in my head I'm not

1182
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,500
sure I've never actually dealt with cows

1183
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:53,339
I don't know anybody know a cow name

1184
00:47:53,339 --> 00:47:55,560
Bessie that's what I should have said

1185
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,359
Bessie

1186
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:58,619
well we talk to people all the time they

1187
00:47:58,619 --> 00:48:00,060
don't understand things they don't

1188
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:01,260
understand what they're talking about

1189
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:03,900
how many people hear how many people

1190
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:07,460
here have heard the statement

1191
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:13,560
no sight should ever use SMS MFA

1192
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:15,660
right I've argued with people on Twitter

1193
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:18,420
about that don't get me wrong Kevin is

1194
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:20,280
not standing up on this stage saying man

1195
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:23,940
SMS MFA is the best way possible that's

1196
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:26,339
not what I'm saying but what I am saying

1197
00:48:26,339 --> 00:48:28,680
is that there are certain areas of the

1198
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,599
country there are certain demographics

1199
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:33,240
age race whatever

1200
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:37,079
whereas many as 30 percent of that

1201
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:38,579
population

1202
00:48:38,579 --> 00:48:42,720
does not have a smartphone

1203
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:46,260
which means the only form of two-factor

1204
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:50,960
authentication they have is SMS

1205
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:53,579
now I'm okay with that for certain

1206
00:48:53,579 --> 00:48:55,560
situations

1207
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:58,020
I'm okay with as a corporation as

1208
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:00,180
security as security is does not support

1209
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:04,920
SMS MFA for our systems why because our

1210
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:08,579
staff all have smartphones they all have

1211
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:10,800
the ability to get on the internet to do

1212
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,720
their job they need a smartphone and the

1213
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,760
ability to get on the internet so for us

1214
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,400
to make that requirement is reasonable

1215
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:21,839
but to say okay I just saw it uh this

1216
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:23,280
morning again this morning this morning

1217
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,339
was great for this talk

1218
00:49:25,339 --> 00:49:28,260
blizzard just announced

1219
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:32,099
that they will not support prepaid cell

1220
00:49:32,099 --> 00:49:33,240
phones

1221
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:36,780
for their guard system like battle guard

1222
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:39,480
or whatever they call it if you want to

1223
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,460
build not bad on that Battlenet is their

1224
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:43,500
system right but to get into Battlenet

1225
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:45,960
they've got this system to help do

1226
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,940
two-factor Authentication

1227
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:50,460
and they will not support prepaid cell

1228
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:51,900
phones

1229
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:53,819
I have family members that have prepaid

1230
00:49:53,819 --> 00:49:55,140
cell phones because they can't afford

1231
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:56,400
anything else

1232
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,960
and I don't like them enough to give

1233
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,380
them a phone

1234
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,700
I have long said the wrong in-laws died

1235
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:05,220
in my family

1236
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:08,540
my wife's parents are dead

1237
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:11,280
they have a prepaid phone so they're not

1238
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,599
allowed to use any Battle of software

1239
00:50:12,599 --> 00:50:14,040
battle net software

1240
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:16,859
that seems bad right and to me that's

1241
00:50:16,859 --> 00:50:19,619
not blizzard being stupid that's a lack

1242
00:50:19,619 --> 00:50:21,960
of understanding of your audience

1243
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:24,180
right and that's important how many

1244
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:26,400
people here go into organizations and

1245
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,460
say oh security you I'll give you a good

1246
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,380
one how many people here have seen an

1247
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:34,020
audit get failed because you're running

1248
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:37,339
TLS 1.1

1249
00:50:37,339 --> 00:50:39,900
yeah let me ask a question raise your

1250
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:42,180
hand if you have ever exploited a

1251
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:43,920
production system we'll assume with

1252
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,660
permission so we're not outing you right

1253
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:48,260
if you have ever exploited a system

1254
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:50,880
directly via

1255
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,020
TLS 1.1

1256
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:55,859
nobody

1257
00:50:55,859 --> 00:50:58,140
right that's one of those checkbox

1258
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:00,359
[ __ ] answers

1259
00:51:00,359 --> 00:51:03,059
oh you're running TLS version one

1260
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:06,119
that's catastrophic [ __ ] they're

1261
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:09,619
also running Windows Vista

1262
00:51:10,619 --> 00:51:12,960
now Windows Vista that's actually one of

1263
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,640
our customers we found Windows Vista in

1264
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,460
their DMZ don't ask

1265
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:19,980
I will acknowledge that's probably safer

1266
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:21,720
than other things they could have run

1267
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,460
because most of the people attacking the

1268
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:25,680
network are too young to remember

1269
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:29,058
Windows Vista

1270
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,700
one of my Consultants actually said I

1271
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:34,740
thought it was a joke

1272
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:36,599
and he meant the operating system

1273
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:38,420
because he was

1274
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:41,819
born after Windows Vista

1275
00:51:41,819 --> 00:51:43,380
oh

1276
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:45,300
I'm old

1277
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:47,160
right people don't understand the

1278
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:49,140
systems they're doing I had like okay

1279
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:52,680
great I have TLS 1.1 that's bad for

1280
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:55,140
compliance reasons but is it really a

1281
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:57,599
risk or a threat to my organization

1282
00:51:57,599 --> 00:51:59,460
right it's kind of like that whole thing

1283
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:01,619
about reputational harm

1284
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:03,780
how many people here have said as an

1285
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:05,099
info no don't raise your hand for this

1286
00:52:05,099 --> 00:52:06,119
one because I'm going to call you out

1287
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:09,180
how many people here have heard

1288
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:11,220
oh my God we have to fix this problem if

1289
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:13,800
we get hacked it'll be reputational harm

1290
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,500
right we hear it all the time in my

1291
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,020
opinion reputational harm said by a

1292
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:21,119
consultant or a security person is the

1293
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,440
easiest way to find out that they're

1294
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,780
either lazy or stupid

1295
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:26,700
one of the two

1296
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:29,520
and the reason I say that is that very

1297
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:32,160
few examples of reputational harm can

1298
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,440
actually be shown to be worth

1299
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,960
that that's the only risk

1300
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,220
let me be very clear how many people

1301
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:40,440
still shop at Target

1302
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:43,200
right how many people still shop at Best

1303
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,040
Buy

1304
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:47,700
the NSA is still an agency

1305
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:52,200
right South Carolina still has residents

1306
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:53,940
these are all examples of organizations

1307
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:56,819
that have been compromised massively

1308
00:52:56,819 --> 00:53:00,000
and yet we still deal with them we still

1309
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,980
work with them we still shop at their

1310
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:03,420
organizations

1311
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:05,099
they actually interviewed people right

1312
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:07,380
after the TJ Maxx attack I know that's

1313
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:09,660
an old one I actually saw interviews

1314
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:11,099
with people hey you know this company

1315
00:53:11,099 --> 00:53:12,900
was compromised right yes you know the

1316
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:14,579
attacker stole credit card numbers right

1317
00:53:14,579 --> 00:53:16,619
yes did you just pay with a credit card

1318
00:53:16,619 --> 00:53:17,760
yes

1319
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:20,940
aren't you worried no because they must

1320
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:24,079
be secure now

1321
00:53:24,359 --> 00:53:27,680
it was like weeks after

1322
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:30,540
right people don't know I was teaching a

1323
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,099
class once and the one class argue with

1324
00:53:32,099 --> 00:53:33,780
me and they said

1325
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:36,599
no no no my organization has done a lot

1326
00:53:36,599 --> 00:53:39,000
of research in it and our biggest risk

1327
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,700
across the board that is words not mine

1328
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:45,300
his words were our biggest risk as an

1329
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:47,280
organization across the board is

1330
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,380
reputational harm

1331
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:50,819
and I looked at this dude and I'm like

1332
00:53:50,819 --> 00:53:53,160
you're wrong

1333
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,720
I'm not saying reputational harm doesn't

1334
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,700
happen I'm saying there are other risks

1335
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:58,020
that are bigger

1336
00:53:58,020 --> 00:53:59,640
that's why I say it's either lazy or

1337
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:02,099
stupid you're too lazy to figure out the

1338
00:54:02,099 --> 00:54:03,300
other risks

1339
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:04,440
because you don't have the understanding

1340
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,599
or whatever or or you are actually

1341
00:54:06,599 --> 00:54:08,160
stupid and I say stupid they're not

1342
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:11,220
ignorant ignorant is curable

1343
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:12,480
even though what we see on Facebook

1344
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,540
implies it's not

1345
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:17,700
ignorance is curable stupid as you had

1346
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:18,839
the opportunity to learn it and you

1347
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:21,180
chose not to okay or you chose not to

1348
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:23,460
accept the facts and this guy said no

1349
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:25,200
Kevin reputational harm is our biggest

1350
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,819
risk I'm like really he's like yes we've

1351
00:54:26,819 --> 00:54:28,559
done a lot of research like great I'll

1352
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:30,119
bite

1353
00:54:30,119 --> 00:54:32,460
who do you work for

1354
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:35,240
Comcast

1355
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,640
that was my reaction I laughed because I

1356
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,980
assumed he was kidding

1357
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:44,400
their reputation can't get worse

1358
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:48,119
as a customer of theirs I am hoping they

1359
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:49,619
get hacked because I believe the

1360
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:53,599
attackers would run their Network better

1361
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,579
we don't understand what we're getting

1362
00:54:56,579 --> 00:54:57,420
into

1363
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:58,920
we don't understand the things we're

1364
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,839
working with we don't understand the

1365
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:02,760
Technologies and things like that let me

1366
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:05,040
be clear I I I was actually and I was

1367
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,839
verifying it wasn't Booz Allen because I

1368
00:55:06,839 --> 00:55:07,980
didn't want to make fun of you guys well

1369
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:09,420
I was going to make fun of you guys from

1370
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:12,180
stage if it was you but anybody here see

1371
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:14,460
that you and why

1372
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:19,020
got fined for cheating on the tests

1373
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:23,180
they cheated on the ethics portion

1374
00:55:24,839 --> 00:55:27,359
that to me is a lack of understanding

1375
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:30,059
it's also an ethical problem but that's

1376
00:55:30,059 --> 00:55:32,579
a different conversation

1377
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:35,579
like we keep hiring groups like that I

1378
00:55:35,579 --> 00:55:37,619
actually regularly compete with

1379
00:55:37,619 --> 00:55:39,839
organizations like eny and Booz Allen

1380
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:42,780
and things like that on on jobs

1381
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:44,579
and I always say to myself like wait do

1382
00:55:44,579 --> 00:55:46,380
you not understand who you're hiring and

1383
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:48,180
I'm not saying we're better well we

1384
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:49,559
haven't cheated on the ethics portion of

1385
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:50,940
anything

1386
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:52,380
hell I don't think we've cheated on

1387
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:54,559
anything

1388
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:57,420
but I'm not saying you can't use

1389
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:59,700
organizations like that I'm saying that

1390
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:03,180
comparing us to an E and why

1391
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:06,059
those are night and day different

1392
00:56:06,059 --> 00:56:07,740
right we don't consider them a

1393
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:09,599
competitor and that's not an underhanded

1394
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:11,579
backhanded compliment where I'm saying

1395
00:56:11,579 --> 00:56:12,720
we don't consider look better because

1396
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:15,180
they suck I'm just like we don't think

1397
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:16,800
of them as a competitor

1398
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:17,940
because they don't do the same thing

1399
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:19,859
that's what we do how many people here

1400
00:56:19,859 --> 00:56:21,960
do pen tests of applications and have

1401
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:24,180
never written any web code

1402
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:25,380
right

1403
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:27,480
how many people here have tested

1404
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:30,300
networks done Kerber roasting

1405
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:32,640
and never actually implemented active

1406
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:33,960
directory

1407
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,540
right yeah and that doesn't mean you

1408
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:38,700
can't I want to be very clear I'm going

1409
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:40,079
to pick on you Becky you knew this right

1410
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:42,540
she sat up front she knew I was going to

1411
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:43,619
pick on her

1412
00:56:43,619 --> 00:56:45,720
Becky raised her hand when I said how

1413
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:46,859
many people here have done web pen

1414
00:56:46,859 --> 00:56:49,680
testing without having written web code

1415
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,599
and she raised her hand because she's

1416
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:53,819
not a web developer right but do you

1417
00:56:53,819 --> 00:56:55,500
know what she is

1418
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:58,260
[ __ ] awesome pen tester

1419
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:00,480
I've seen the stuff she's done she's

1420
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,099
good at it but do you know the

1421
00:57:02,099 --> 00:57:04,200
difference between her and somebody who

1422
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:05,700
hasn't done web code and is doing pen

1423
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:07,680
testing and not doing it well is that

1424
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:10,559
she's actually focused and looked at

1425
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:13,500
trying to understand the system that

1426
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,000
she's testing

1427
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,520
she's actually trying to figure out how

1428
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:20,460
it works and what it does

1429
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:21,960
and that's all you got to do I'm not

1430
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:23,520
telling you you have to go back to being

1431
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,260
an admin you don't have to go back to

1432
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:27,599
being on the help desk I'm saying

1433
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:30,720
understand the technology

1434
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,040
and you're going to run into things you

1435
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:35,099
don't understand I do every day I don't

1436
00:57:35,099 --> 00:57:36,839
understand why people ask me to get on

1437
00:57:36,839 --> 00:57:39,558
stage and speak

1438
00:57:40,099 --> 00:57:42,420
but when you find something you don't

1439
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:44,579
understand don't we at a consultant that

1440
00:57:44,579 --> 00:57:45,839
we fired

1441
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:48,420
say yep you out I wasn't pointing it

1442
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:49,500
Becky there

1443
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:50,880
because that's what it looked like the

1444
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,500
minute I did it like hey you get the

1445
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:54,480
[ __ ] out of here no we had a consultant

1446
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,160
every single time we would ask him a

1447
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,599
question hey have you got any experience

1448
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,579
with this yes I do

1449
00:57:59,579 --> 00:58:02,220
really because you've known every other

1450
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:05,040
[ __ ] technology we've asked you about

1451
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,559
I know everything

1452
00:58:07,559 --> 00:58:09,240
he was under the impression that

1453
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:11,640
Consultants should always say yes I know

1454
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,319
that

1455
00:58:13,319 --> 00:58:15,119
I can do that

1456
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:17,940
here's the reality I can do anything I

1457
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:18,839
can

1458
00:58:18,839 --> 00:58:20,940
I absolutely can

1459
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:22,800
give it enough time and enough go I'll

1460
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,599
go I can do it

1461
00:58:24,599 --> 00:58:26,280
doesn't mean I can do it well

1462
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:29,760
doesn't mean I can do it worthwhile Lee

1463
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,680
my wife told me a few years ago Kevin

1464
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:34,500
you need a hobby that doesn't involve

1465
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,059
computers

1466
00:58:36,059 --> 00:58:38,880
and then I made a horrible decision

1467
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,900
I bought a lathe

1468
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,700
and I started making pens

1469
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:47,660
and they suck

1470
00:58:48,119 --> 00:58:50,460
I now own more pens than any human

1471
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:52,500
should own

1472
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,900
I don't know what to do with them but I

1473
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:56,339
love making them

1474
00:58:56,339 --> 00:58:59,099
and I figured out how to do it am I uh

1475
00:58:59,099 --> 00:59:02,040
and I have had multiple of my pens sold

1476
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:03,780
so I can actually tell you that I'm a

1477
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:07,760
professional pen maker and tester

1478
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:12,180
but I'm not good at it

1479
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:14,280
I enjoy it it's something I get to play

1480
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:15,599
around with

1481
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:17,700
so I would never go to somebody and say

1482
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:20,339
hey do you need corporate pen giveaways

1483
00:59:20,339 --> 00:59:22,500
and let me make 200 and pay me money

1484
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:26,040
right because I know my limitations

1485
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:28,200
I understand that when I don't know

1486
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:30,540
something you know what I do I call

1487
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:32,099
somebody

1488
00:59:32,099 --> 00:59:34,079
hey this is my question this is my

1489
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:36,000
problem this is what I'm dealing with

1490
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,400
right I have a team of people we got 25

1491
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,920
people on staff the number of times that

1492
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:43,440
I'm so thrilled by this the number of

1493
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:46,799
times I see one of my Consultants say in

1494
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:49,619
our slack workspace hey I'm seeing

1495
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:51,119
something weird I've never seen before

1496
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:53,040
anybody want to jump into a meet and

1497
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,359
talk about it

1498
00:59:54,359 --> 00:59:55,920
and they all get together like oh man

1499
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,059
this is the way this works this is what

1500
00:59:57,059 --> 00:59:58,559
happened oh man that's awesome oh I

1501
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:00,660
could do this I could do this Eric Keane

1502
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:02,339
he's one of our principals

1503
01:00:02,339 --> 01:00:04,920
he

1504
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:07,500
I swear to you that if he walks into

1505
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:09,240
your building your active directory

1506
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:11,099
infrastructure will just make him a

1507
01:00:11,099 --> 01:00:13,440
domain admin

1508
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,599
like he knows stuff about ad that

1509
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:17,760
Microsoft doesn't know right like the

1510
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:19,079
guy and I don't think I'm exaggerating

1511
01:00:19,079 --> 01:00:21,240
there the dude is just like an active

1512
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:22,980
directory Whisperer

1513
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:24,119
right

1514
01:00:24,119 --> 01:00:27,000
I would like Enterprise admin no problem

1515
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:31,260
here you go right regularly we drop into

1516
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:33,299
networks and we run into some stuff and

1517
01:00:33,299 --> 01:00:35,460
you call Eric and he's like okay you

1518
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:37,559
have admin rights thanks and um right

1519
01:00:37,559 --> 01:00:39,540
like he just knows this stuff and he

1520
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:41,760
understands it and he regularly gets

1521
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,740
pulled around why because he's good at

1522
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:45,839
it then you got Corey

1523
01:00:45,839 --> 01:00:49,099
Corey just understands game security

1524
01:00:49,099 --> 01:00:51,780
understands how the games work so when

1525
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:54,119
we're testing a gaming system we reach

1526
01:00:54,119 --> 01:00:56,220
out to Corey even if he's not assigned

1527
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:57,420
to the job

1528
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:59,760
I know that if I'm gonna

1529
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:03,000
futz around with OT stuff

1530
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,160
I'm going to reach out to Don Weber from

1531
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:06,780
cutaway security

1532
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:10,200
why because he's damn good at it have I

1533
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,660
done OT stuff yes quite a bit like I

1534
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:14,160
said my first job out of high school was

1535
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:18,180
writing code to control the power grid

1536
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:22,559
I know OT stuff I know ICS I know scada

1537
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:24,540
but if I really want to test it Don's

1538
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:25,680
who I call

1539
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:29,779
because that's what he lives

1540
01:01:30,059 --> 01:01:32,040
we have to have a community of people

1541
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:33,660
that we can reach out to

1542
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:35,400
and when you ask a question and the

1543
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,079
person says I'm not telling you that

1544
01:01:37,079 --> 01:01:39,000
because that's my secret sauce they

1545
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,859
don't actually know it

1546
01:01:40,859 --> 01:01:42,359
that's what that means

1547
01:01:42,359 --> 01:01:44,160
because there is no secret sauce in this

1548
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,200
industry there's no secret sauce as a

1549
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:47,819
pen tester you want to know how I pen

1550
01:01:47,819 --> 01:01:49,559
test stuff I'll tell you and you don't

1551
01:01:49,559 --> 01:01:50,700
even have to ask me you can go to my

1552
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:53,220
website it outlines it

1553
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:55,980
we're about to release

1554
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:58,980
all of our introductory training

1555
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:01,559
free to anybody on the internet without

1556
01:02:01,559 --> 01:02:03,059
an account

1557
01:02:03,059 --> 01:02:05,040
no no that's not a that's the way it

1558
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:07,079
should be everybody should have access

1559
01:02:07,079 --> 01:02:08,520
to this stuff

1560
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:11,220
the anti-siphon model of pay what you

1561
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:12,240
can

1562
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,220
I love

1563
01:02:14,220 --> 01:02:16,500
because in my opinion every single

1564
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:19,319
person who learns something new makes

1565
01:02:19,319 --> 01:02:21,780
all of us better

1566
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:24,119
and the best way to learn something is

1567
01:02:24,119 --> 01:02:27,059
to teach it to somebody else

1568
01:02:27,059 --> 01:02:30,420
I the number of times I've been on in on

1569
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:32,579
stage or in a class teaching something

1570
01:02:32,579 --> 01:02:34,619
and somebody has asked a question and

1571
01:02:34,619 --> 01:02:36,660
being like [ __ ] man I don't know

1572
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:39,420
I don't know that let's look it up or

1573
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:41,040
I've had somebody say something back to

1574
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:43,500
me it's like oh this is how that works

1575
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:46,260
we as penetration testers whether we are

1576
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:48,359
full-time Consultants pen testing or

1577
01:02:48,359 --> 01:02:50,520
whether we fuss around with bug bounties

1578
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:53,280
or whether we want to be involved in

1579
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:54,540
security

1580
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:57,900
we need to make ourselves better

1581
01:02:57,900 --> 01:02:59,640
I'm not saying we should have licensing

1582
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:01,079
I'm not saying we should have degrees

1583
01:03:01,079 --> 01:03:02,579
I'm not saying we should have any of

1584
01:03:02,579 --> 01:03:03,599
that stuff

1585
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:05,400
what I'm saying is that we should hold

1586
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:07,799
each other accountable

1587
01:03:07,799 --> 01:03:10,200
if you're releasing pen test puppy mill

1588
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:14,160
reports [ __ ] stop

1589
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:16,200
if you're running nessus and calling it

1590
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:19,020
a pen test stop

1591
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:20,640
if you don't understand the technology

1592
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:26,160
that you're using or attacking stop

1593
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:28,260
plain and simple

1594
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:29,819
go learn it

1595
01:03:29,819 --> 01:03:32,520
play around with it try it out

1596
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:35,339
talk to other people

1597
01:03:35,339 --> 01:03:37,260
if you work for a company that's getting

1598
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:39,720
pen tests done hold your pen testers

1599
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:40,799
accountable

1600
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:43,440
do ride-alongs we tell our customers all

1601
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:44,339
the time you want to see what we're

1602
01:03:44,339 --> 01:03:45,359
doing

1603
01:03:45,359 --> 01:03:46,680
if you're in Jacksonville come sit in

1604
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:47,880
the office

1605
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:50,220
if you're not let's go and meet as we're

1606
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:51,780
doing the pen test and we'll explain the

1607
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:53,579
stuff we're doing we'll show you this

1608
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:55,740
stuff if you get a report from a pen

1609
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:57,839
test and you don't understand how to

1610
01:03:57,839 --> 01:03:59,819
reproduce the vulnerability they found

1611
01:03:59,819 --> 01:04:02,819
the exploit they did that's not a good

1612
01:04:02,819 --> 01:04:04,200
report

1613
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,780
if you get a report and it doesn't give

1614
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:09,780
you a story of the test

1615
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:12,299
including the things they tried that

1616
01:04:12,299 --> 01:04:16,700
failed then it's not a good report

1617
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:20,099
if the report doesn't tell you the

1618
01:04:20,099 --> 01:04:22,559
things you did right along with the

1619
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:24,240
things you did wrong

1620
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:27,000
it's not a good report

1621
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,440
do better

1622
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:31,020
make sense

1623
01:04:31,020 --> 01:04:32,579
thank you very much are there any

1624
01:04:32,579 --> 01:04:34,140
questions or comments or things you want

1625
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:35,460
to throw at Ben

1626
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:38,460
Amendment

1627
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:41,819
cool I think I'm oh I went one minute

1628
01:04:41,819 --> 01:04:44,480
over I'm sorry

1629
01:04:50,819 --> 01:04:54,000
so the question is do I have an opinion

1630
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,520
of black box versus white box I'm going

1631
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:58,380
to throw in their gray box as well just

1632
01:04:58,380 --> 01:04:59,700
I know you didn't ask that but I'm gonna

1633
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:03,000
add it what's my opinion because you

1634
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,680
correct me if I'm saying this wrong but

1635
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:06,480
you do not believe you've seen much

1636
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:10,099
benefit out of a black box test

1637
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:12,180
meaning

1638
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:14,520
less

1639
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:16,799
mechanisms

1640
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:18,240
right so you're saying you don't think

1641
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:21,379
the black box test is useful

1642
01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:24,119
cool I'm cool with that I personally

1643
01:05:24,119 --> 01:05:26,220
believe that most people ask for Black

1644
01:05:26,220 --> 01:05:28,559
Box tests and don't need them

1645
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:31,500
I believe there are very few cases where

1646
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:33,359
a block and just to be clear my

1647
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:35,819
definition of a black box test is I have

1648
01:05:35,819 --> 01:05:38,299
no information about the organization

1649
01:05:38,299 --> 01:05:41,880
except the name of the organization and

1650
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:45,780
the point of contact right go hack

1651
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:48,380
Walmart

1652
01:05:49,079 --> 01:05:51,180
I said that for Ben hey do you guys know

1653
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:53,640
why Walmart wasn't hacked

1654
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:55,619
they're not a Target

1655
01:05:55,619 --> 01:05:56,819
um

1656
01:05:56,819 --> 01:05:59,700
so in my opinion most organizations are

1657
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:02,280
not benefited by a black box test the

1658
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:03,780
reason is the idea behind a black box

1659
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:05,160
test one they're going to be more

1660
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:06,299
expensive

1661
01:06:06,299 --> 01:06:09,720
on average a black box test costs twice

1662
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:12,480
as much at secure ideas than a gray box

1663
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:13,680
test where you give us Target

1664
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:15,180
information and things like that and

1665
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:16,920
then we go after white box is when we

1666
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:19,260
have code and you know document like all

1667
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:20,220
that kind of stuff

1668
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:21,839
um and the reason we do that is because

1669
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:24,000
we have to do all of this oh sent up

1670
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,099
front that we don't have to necessarily

1671
01:06:26,099 --> 01:06:28,980
do with a gray box test right now let me

1672
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:30,960
be blunt you're paying for that time

1673
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:34,380
and is it worth that time for most

1674
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:36,240
companies the answer is no and the

1675
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:38,700
reason the answer is no is because we

1676
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:40,920
know it's kind of like phishing tests in

1677
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:42,180
my opinion for most organizations

1678
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:44,160
phishing tests are a waste of money

1679
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:46,260
what does a phishing test prove that

1680
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:48,000
people click links

1681
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,819
I can tell you right now

1682
01:06:50,819 --> 01:06:52,859
why will they click links because you

1683
01:06:52,859 --> 01:06:54,839
send them a [ __ ] link every year to

1684
01:06:54,839 --> 01:06:56,099
tell them to click on it to tell them

1685
01:06:56,099 --> 01:06:58,559
not to click on links you just call it

1686
01:06:58,559 --> 01:07:01,319
security awareness training

1687
01:07:01,319 --> 01:07:03,299
click this link you shouldn't have done

1688
01:07:03,299 --> 01:07:05,400
that that's all you had to do build a

1689
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,500
website that just said loudly you

1690
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:08,760
shouldn't have done that and there's

1691
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:11,339
your fishing training right

1692
01:07:11,339 --> 01:07:13,380
black box is the same way there are

1693
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:15,180
certain organizations that actually

1694
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:17,339
Black Box testing makes sense we can

1695
01:07:17,339 --> 01:07:19,079
talk about the types of organizations

1696
01:07:19,079 --> 01:07:20,880
those fit but for the majority of

1697
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:22,200
organizations it's a waste of money

1698
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:24,599
right do gray box testing do white box

1699
01:07:24,599 --> 01:07:26,460
testing do security assessments work

1700
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:28,559
with a consultant don't just do a black

1701
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:31,020
box test the problem is Black Box test

1702
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:32,819
is sexy to talk about

1703
01:07:32,819 --> 01:07:34,380
right

1704
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:36,180
get up on stage I flew the planes

1705
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:38,280
sideways right like that kind of thing

1706
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:40,260
so make sense

1707
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:43,200
cool everybody enjoy yourself hang out

1708
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:45,059
all day this is the best conference you

1709
01:07:45,059 --> 01:07:48,140
will be in in this room

1710
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,759
thank you
