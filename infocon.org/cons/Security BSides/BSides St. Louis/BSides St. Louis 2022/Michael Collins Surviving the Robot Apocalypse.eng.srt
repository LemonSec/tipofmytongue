41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,860
us and happy hour here although happy

42
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,659
hour's already started I I recommend

43
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,340
drinking a bit before I light my device

44
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,920
off here anyway so go go get a drink

45
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,560
relax it's gonna be fine nobody's gonna

46
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,419
die I promise

47
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,660
um title of my talk today is uh

48
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,580
surviving the toaster apocalypse I mean

49
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,280
sorry uh the robot apocalypse

50
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,200
um building a practical portable

51
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,220
short-range EMP device

52
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:25,440
uh a few a few disclaimers before I get

53
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,459
going

54
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:28,860
um my uh my employer uh has nothing to

55
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,020
do with this this is all my thoughts

56
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,720
um just want to make that super clear

57
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,239
um uh it's it's basically the view my

58
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,980
views and probably not any other

59
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:41,340
employer or rational human being here so

60
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,300
um

61
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,720
uh a few other disclaimers if you are a

62
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,120
robot I need you to disclose it now

63
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,500
please

64
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,040
um anyone anyone Ben I was sure Ben was

65
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,680
was a robot somehow so

66
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,260
um uh if you are a robot or you have a

67
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,680
uh some sort of uh pacemaker in possibly

68
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,940
I would recommend not getting super

69
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,440
close to the stage while I'm doing this

70
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,900
this should be super low powered

71
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,360
um but uh when I get to part of my talk

72
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,220
here you'll see why I'm a little nervous

73
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,080
about some of this stuff

74
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,500
um no no actual robots were harmed uh is

75
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,640
part of the creation of this

76
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,379
presentation so

77
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:20,519
um

78
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:24,300
uh so in case anyone is a robot and they

79
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,580
didn't disclose that they're a robot uh

80
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,319
luckily we have a completely foolproof

81
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,099
mechanism of identifying robots so if uh

82
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:34,860
if everybody could fill out the uh this

83
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,599
thing let me know where the crosswalks

84
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:39,120
are uh I'm gonna I'm gonna find you if

85
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,560
you're uh if you're a mechanical being

86
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,659
here so

87
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:45,659
um quick uh quick agenda we'll talk a

88
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,040
little bit about kind of current state

89
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,140
of robot technology uh kind of the

90
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,760
weaponization of robots which has been

91
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,620
really interesting

92
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,239
um why don't we just hack the robots

93
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,159
this is a hacking conference why don't

94
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,780
we just hack it

95
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,180
um uh we'll we'll talk a little bit

96
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,220
about just EMP in general like what it

97
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,680
is is a concept like some natural and

98
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,540
artificial sources of it

99
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,620
um and then we'll we'll kind of Dive

100
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,260
Right into some of my designs uh uh that

101
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,500
uh that I came up with for this

102
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,100
uh so uh a little a little about me

103
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,620
um I uh um I've worked in infosec since

104
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,560
96 but I always tell people that uh on

105
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,120
what happens to teenage hackers when

106
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,680
they grow up and get a job so I actually

107
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,840
started little probably about six I

108
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,220
started programming in fifth grade

109
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,560
started hacking in sixth grade

110
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,660
I'm old so things were very different

111
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,759
back then uh it was a lot of a lot of

112
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,160
phone system hacking and such but uh but

113
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,440
yeah so been around a while

114
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,780
um I'm a previous two-time presenter at

115
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,360
b-sides I gave a keynote one year and

116
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,560
then the thing a lot of people remember

117
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,220
me for is I gave a drone talk about

118
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,860
basically wiring a uh um a wireless

119
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,580
hacking kit uh to a drone and using it

120
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,380
to like land on a building uh it was

121
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,060
cool because I could get about five

122
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,460
minutes of flight time about 12 hours of

123
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,320
compute time to do my wireless hacking

124
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,900
and then take the Drone back off and the

125
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,000
whole thing would call back out over a

126
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,220
cell kit so I could I could be like

127
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,139
logged into the whole kit uh from from

128
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:14,400
my laptop the whole time which was

129
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,139
pretty cool so

130
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:20,100
um uh yeah so uh I'm uh I'm a black belt

131
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,139
and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu

132
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:24,780
um my uh my nickname at Jiu Jitsu is

133
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,699
cardio there's literally people who only

134
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:28,440
know me as cardio

135
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,259
um I uh it's not a nice nickname when I

136
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:33,600
started Jiu Jitsu I weighed around 260

137
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,000
pounds I was in terrible shape so I got

138
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,800
the nickname back then and then I've

139
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,720
kind of just grown into it over time but

140
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,840
uh but really like Jiu Jitsu a lot

141
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,600
um uh I'm a Avid video gamer probably

142
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,919
when I'm not hacking I'm either doing

143
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:49,979
Jiu Jitsu or video games uh dog dad as

144
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:52,020
you see and then uh recently we got

145
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,440
horses so I think I'm uh I'm like rip on

146
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,820
Yellowstone basically if you've seen

147
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,500
that show I'm not really I'm not that

148
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,080
cool but I'm working on it so

149
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,520
um

150
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,740
so let's Dive Right In I promise I

151
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,660
didn't coordinate with with wolf on the

152
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,460
slides here there's there's uh we

153
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,740
literally use the same same graphic here

154
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,539
even

155
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,940
um but uh but I I promise

156
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,960
um so so robots from a weaponized

157
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,940
standpoint have actually been around for

158
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,740
a lot longer than you would think right

159
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,240
uh

160
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,720
um uh these these pictures here uh the

161
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,199
the ones on the left are a uh um uh

162
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,880
that's actually Germans that have

163
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,940
captured it's called a uh um a Goliath

164
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,860
uh and basically it was like a tank

165
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,440
tread type design uh it would be fitted

166
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,060
with explosives you could drive it under

167
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,860
things blow it up

168
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,180
um so those those have been around quite

169
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,280
a while you can see kind of a museum

170
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,740
version of one on the bottom uh the

171
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,660
Soviets had a similar type of thing

172
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,580
which is what you see on the right uh

173
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,979
that pictures from 1940

174
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:58,860
um it's it's called a Soviet TT 26

175
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,220
teletank

176
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,300
which could also be used to describe

177
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,160
toasters apparently because it's a

178
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,620
letter and a number here so

179
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,539
um

180
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:12,180
so so there are uh there are quite a few

181
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,340
like robot type things currently in use

182
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,620
from a military perspective

183
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,380
um this one on the far left is a a South

184
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,479
Korean design uh they use it to watch

185
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:24,360
the uh the demilitarized zone uh so it's

186
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,800
kind of a century if you play Call of

187
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,199
Duty I imagine it's a lot like that uh

188
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,460
probably not

189
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,160
um the uh um this one in the middle is

190
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,020
uh is called the goalkeeper it's a Dutch

191
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,000
design it actually sits on the ship and

192
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,580
it's pretty semi-autonomous as far as

193
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,319
like uh going out and like trying to

194
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,460
shoot stuff down that's trying to get

195
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,960
close to the ship so again kind of a

196
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,180
Sentry type design

197
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,620
um and then everybody's super familiar

198
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,900
with the predator drones that are uh

199
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,360
that are in wide use uh

200
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,919
um you know basically flown from back

201
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:54,479
here in the States you know bombing

202
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,160
stuff overseas

203
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,860
um uh you know used by the military uh

204
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,580
and the the CIA uh wiped out a lot of

205
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,160
a lot of a lot of people with uh with

206
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,259
with those uh specifically

207
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:09,319
um

208
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,440
the uh a lot of a lot of robots

209
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,180
currently in use from a military

210
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,000
perspective are very similar to this

211
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,500
kind of design again right like it's a

212
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,479
typical kind of tank tread type of

213
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:24,539
design uh this Talent on the left if

214
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:26,520
anybody served in the Gulf uh probably

215
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,199
saw these a bit

216
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,699
um they use them for all sorts of stuff

217
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:30,960
right like they use them to kind of hunt

218
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,719
down IEDs they use it uh

219
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:37,140
um you know just all sorts of things

220
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:40,320
um this one in the middle uh is uh they

221
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,479
call it Themis

222
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:43,979
um it's an unmanned version It's again

223
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:46,560
it's an unmanned thing again tank tread

224
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,000
design

225
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,100
um you know these aren't super super

226
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,600
fast typically

227
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,160
um and they're all generally remote

228
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,019
controlled right so that's true with The

229
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:57,000
Predator that's true with a lot of these

230
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,500
tank tread type designs that you see

231
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,279
here this uh this one on the right is uh

232
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:03,860
is a Chinese design

233
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,839
they primarily use it uh apparently on

234
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,700
the the border between India and China

235
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,800
right now for like uh Patrol things

236
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,380
things like that you can see this one's

237
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,600
typically has a has a gun mounted to the

238
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,300
top of it so it's not like this stuff

239
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,220
doesn't exist already right like there's

240
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,019
there's definitely uh you know

241
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:25,740
weaponized uh uh robots you know that

242
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,720
are that are out there currently

243
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,040
um

244
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,560
there's a there's also a number of of

245
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,480
Home versions of uh just kind of

246
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,580
consumer robots

247
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,680
um this one on the left is the it's

248
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,959
Amazon Astro it's kind of a new one that

249
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:41,399
they've come up with basically the

250
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:43,560
thought is it would it has the ability

251
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,480
to drive around your house kind of check

252
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,959
on the dog uh throw your laundry in I

253
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,160
don't think I can throw the laundry in

254
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,600
but you know it you know just stuff like

255
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,880
that um that that one's about 999

256
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,860
dollars so I decided that wasn't a good

257
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,440
candidate for uh killing a robot today

258
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,420
uh this is already probably my most

259
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,980
expensive talk which we'll we'll get

260
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,160
into here in a second but um uh you know

261
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,540
there's the uh

262
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,339
the robot vacuums which are Super

263
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:09,600
popular

264
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,220
um and then this one on the right is is

265
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:14,580
just like 199 dollar uh kid kid-friendly

266
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,459
like you know teach them stem stuff

267
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:19,920
um I I would have

268
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,680
uh several years ago at a b-sides

269
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,240
conference in Vegas there was a guy

270
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,480
giving a talk on uh uh robot security

271
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,640
right like a consumer grade robot and

272
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,200
what you would do to kind of protect all

273
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,660
of that and before I went into that talk

274
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,899
I would have said I don't really give if

275
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:38,880
if somebody could like break into my

276
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,740
robot at home and drive it around I just

277
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,360
I just didn't see the wrist posture

278
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,740
there I wasn't really super worried

279
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,959
about it when I got out of that I was

280
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:47,700
really actually way more worried about

281
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,620
it because you don't really think about

282
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,959
all of the electronics that are in even

283
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:55,440
a reasonable consumer grade robot right

284
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,480
there's there's probably a microphone so

285
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,940
that it can listen to what's going on

286
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:02,399
there's probably a camera so you know it

287
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,779
might be spying on me while I'm in the

288
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:05,519
bathroom maybe I don't know I don't know

289
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,079
why anybody would want to do that but

290
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:09,000
you know it could happen you know

291
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,300
um there is a typically a gyroscope in

292
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,640
uh in the robot so that it can Orient

293
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,279
itself you know kind of detect these

294
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,079
types of things and then then he said

295
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:20,160
something that really got me thinking

296
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,860
he's like and the gyroscope can be used

297
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,800
as a microphone and I was like

298
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,839
well that's interesting because you know

299
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:28,920
everybody's always worried about like

300
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,300
your phone listening to you and stuff

301
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,579
and we think about that a lot right

302
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:34,079
um and you know all of these tech

303
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,000
companies are very clear they're like we

304
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,860
don't use the microphone to listen to

305
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,800
you on your device but you know just

306
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,600
food for thought if you can use the

307
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,120
gyroscope as a listening device you're

308
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,680
kind of parsing words there a little bit

309
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,260
right uh and I I got to thinking about

310
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,540
kind of the potential especially like uh

311
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,519
because I know people have tried to

312
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,959
replicate this where like you sit at

313
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,399
dinner and you talk about stuff and it

314
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,779
just never happens but but everybody

315
00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:00,120
here has got a story about how like

316
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,920
something happened where and there's

317
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,600
just no chance anybody was searching it

318
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,459
around you and I got to thinking you

319
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:06,839
know even it could be something simple

320
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:09,300
as sometimes there's like an inflection

321
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,740
in your voice before you talk about

322
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,420
something that you're excited about and

323
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,399
maybe maybe it could even hear that

324
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,560
capture just a little bit of vibration

325
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,180
after that and then match that up to

326
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,040
like a database and be like that guy

327
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,140
just talked about camping which would

328
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,600
never happen in my case but um but you

329
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,640
know and then Fiji stuff on your feed

330
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,959
for that so

331
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:30,180
um so so again while they seem benign

332
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,800
you know there's a lot uh there's

333
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,240
there's actually some stuff to worry

334
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,300
about even with the consumer grade uh

335
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,140
robot right

336
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,660
um this one may be a little hard to see

337
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,540
um just on a whim I was like because you

338
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,620
can get everything on Amazon

339
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,600
right like so I'm out on Amazon I'm like

340
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,279
there's no chance that you can get a

341
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:52,620
home defense robot on Amazon and guess

342
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,660
what there's a home defense robot on

343
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,800
Amazon

344
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,260
um you it can be had for the super

345
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,480
reasonable price of a twenty six

346
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,220
thousand dollars if you'd like to invest

347
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,779
in such a thing

348
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:07,260
um the the text here is a little small

349
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,120
um but but basically there's a spot in

350
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,800
it where it's saying that you can you

351
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,800
can fit it with a a fire extinguisher or

352
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,040
a weapon right so

353
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,600
um I'm a little worried about this one I

354
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,399
feel like you you'd maybe shoot the dog

355
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,839
or something more likely than you would

356
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,839
shoot a uh uh an intruder but but again

357
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:27,300
like this this stuff isn't crazy far off

358
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,500
right

359
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,339
um

360
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:32,519
similar to the that Amazon little robot

361
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:34,380
that goes around they've now got little

362
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,320
uh I was actually gonna do a follow-on

363
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,940
talk to my drone talk originally about

364
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,820
basically making a custom rig that would

365
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,440
like if a camera went off on my house

366
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,019
like the Drone would get up and go you

367
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:48,000
know hit wherever the the stuff was

368
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,040
going on and take video well it turns

369
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,300
out Amazon was already working on that

370
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,980
there's this little drone basically

371
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,920
it'll go land on a power base

372
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,660
when something's going on or when you

373
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,459
needed to go look around it'll it'll pop

374
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:01,380
up it can fly around your house so so

375
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,779
again this stuff is not crazy far away

376
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:05,459
right like there's there's a lot of

377
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:07,980
capabilities in this space already

378
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:08,700
um

379
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,399
wasn't really too worried about the uh

380
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:13,620
the robot thing though and it's kind of

381
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,360
like uh it's a little like the auto

382
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,180
driving stuff on my Tesla right like all

383
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,339
of a sudden I was just really completely

384
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:22,500
shocked by the amount of progress that

385
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,040
had been made in this space right so

386
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,300
um everybody's seen this guy presumably

387
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:30,899
um

388
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:33,540
let's see if the it'll actually work

389
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,120
um this is this is their Atlas one this

390
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,279
is the you know a bipedal version uh

391
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:39,959
this is Boston Dynamics but both of

392
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:42,839
these are Boston Dynamics designs right

393
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,139
um what's crazy is not just how balanced

394
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:48,000
he is he's very hard to you can kind of

395
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,139
come up and push on him and trying to

396
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,000
push him over he's very uh he's very

397
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,339
good at kind of getting back on his feet

398
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:55,740
um but just the amount of stuff that

399
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,800
they can have them do now as far as like

400
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,079
um you know really really kind of tight

401
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:02,880
spots that he's walking on really really

402
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,380
well balanced

403
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,000
um they're gonna do backflips here in a

404
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,680
second which is really crazy and land on

405
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,180
their feet

406
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,000
um this is not super autonomous it's a

407
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,220
bit of a pre-programmed kind of

408
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,079
choreographed kind of setup that they're

409
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,459
doing here

410
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:18,899
um but combined with a lot of

411
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:21,240
electronics that really make this uh a

412
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,699
capability right like so so this is this

413
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:26,040
is uh this is this is kind of the

414
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,779
Terminator style right like this is the

415
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:31,139
the Dual leg uh you know kind of kind of

416
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:32,519
robot

417
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:33,360
um

418
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,519
this spot

419
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,320
um uh

420
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,300
is the is the dog one that a lot of

421
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,800
people are familiar with now what's

422
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,120
there's two things that are interesting

423
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,519
about this one this guy that's in the

424
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:46,139
background that's picking on the robot

425
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:49,199
is basically in every video that they

426
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,120
have when he's like somebody's beating

427
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,920
up on a robot so when the robot

428
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,839
apocalypse does happen this guy's first

429
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:58,260
to go I promise you like so you know

430
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,839
probably you want to be close to this

431
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:02,579
guy when the robot apocalypse happens

432
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:04,620
because it'll be like the bear catching

433
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,120
the slowest person like they'll go after

434
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,380
him first and then you could you know

435
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,600
you could hopefully run but um what's

436
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,220
crazy about this one

437
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,260
this is all completely autonomous right

438
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,880
like there's no really pre-programming

439
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,440
going on here it just knows that it

440
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,180
needs to open the door and you can see

441
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,800
like no matter how much he messes with

442
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,180
it it's going to keep kind of coming

443
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,380
back

444
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,300
um to open the door this is where stuff

445
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,040
really starts to get scary right like

446
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,779
this you put a weapon on something like

447
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,100
this

448
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,360
um which which is already starting to

449
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,620
happen here

450
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,779
um you know that that that really that

451
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:35,579
really gets scary that guy never gets

452
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:37,920
tired right like he doesn't complain

453
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,860
about the uh uh the breakfast that day

454
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,079
or anything you know he's uh you know it

455
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:44,519
most you know probably needs to go get

456
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:48,199
his batteries recharged so

457
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:51,660
um this literally just came out within

458
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,980
the last day or so which I thought was

459
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,380
super interesting Boston Dynamics has

460
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:58,440
long said that they uh they don't

461
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,320
support people uh putting weapons on

462
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,940
their robots right

463
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,220
um and now they've gotten into it with

464
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,260
uh a few of these other robotics

465
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,939
companies basically making a joint

466
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:10,500
statement saying you know we're not

467
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,079
going to weaponize our robots

468
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,480
um the thing is is they still have a lot

469
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,339
of military application even without

470
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:19,559
weapons on them

471
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:22,079
um and this isn't all the robotics

472
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,520
companies right so there's other

473
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,780
robotics companies out there

474
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,220
one in particular

475
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,500
um ghost systems ghost systems doesn't

476
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,520
give a they they

477
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,440
have versions with sniper rifles on them

478
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,480
they have all sorts of stuff right so

479
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,600
they will gladly partner with military

480
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,660
organizations right now to do this stuff

481
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,299
um really similar design to the spot dog

482
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:49,500
right

483
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,520
um but

484
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,419
um you know there's some really

485
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:53,100
impressive video of this thing actually

486
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,280
shooting super accurately a sniper type

487
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,160
Rifle right off of the top of it

488
00:17:59,160 --> 00:17:59,880
um

489
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,740
this one in the middle you may have seen

490
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,960
recently was uh

491
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,240
um uh Russia showed this one off

492
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,100
um the the good the good thing is is

493
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,020
apparently it's not making a huge impact

494
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,160
for the Russians right now because

495
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,419
they're not doing really well apparently

496
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:15,720
sorry it's a terrible joke but um the

497
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,340
reason the reason it's in a ninja

498
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,140
costume is because it's a Chinese

499
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,480
designed robot and they were trying to

500
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,100
hide that is what the scuttlebutt is

501
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,299
right so

502
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:25,980
um but that's got a launcher on top of

503
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,600
it again

504
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,220
um you know you could presumably get

505
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,840
this into situations where you wouldn't

506
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,640
want to get a person but you're not as

507
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,860
worried about a robot right so so stuff

508
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,679
gets really scary uh this one again on

509
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,620
the on the right is already being used

510
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,539
uh at an Air Force Base they're they're

511
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,039
already training with these things right

512
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,020
they're they're basically like a lot of

513
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,299
Special Forces and stuff we'll we'll

514
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:50,640
have these in tow use them for different

515
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,860
functions you know very similar to kind

516
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,500
of like they use uh uh like a canine

517
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,260
right like you know get it into get it

518
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,520
into places where you need to look or

519
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,140
maybe you're not comfortable having a

520
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,760
person you know all sorts of stuff like

521
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,000
that so so this is this is not super

522
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,880
crazy right like the the uh um you know

523
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,559
we're we're not we're not at Skynet

524
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,360
level yet but it's just gonna take one

525
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,460
exploit I think Tim's gonna cause the Mr

526
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,140
Fowler is going to cause the what

527
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,720
happens to us here probably

528
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,679
um

529
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,280
so so why not just hack the robot right

530
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,160
um so so the first rule of uh of hacking

531
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,780
right is that everything is hackable

532
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,640
right uh

533
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,160
um now that that's with a caveat right

534
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,100
like sometimes that requires access you

535
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,840
know I don't know about you I don't I

536
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,179
don't have a Boston Dynamics uh forty

537
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:40,679
thousand dollar robot at my house to

538
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,120
mess with necessarily but you know

539
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,700
people do have access to that right

540
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,419
um

541
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:47,760
even commercial robots the the talk that

542
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,260
I saw at b-sides where they were given

543
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,760
the talk about how they they kind of

544
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,860
secured their robot platform they they

545
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,500
spent a lot of effort

546
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,780
um to to really put anti-hacking

547
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,820
measures into that robot there's code

548
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,500
signing

549
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,059
um you know there's execution protection

550
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:04,740
there's all of this stuff that goes into

551
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,299
it and I think the difference is because

552
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:07,919
the the liabilities potentially really

553
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,480
big for them right like that you know

554
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,980
that robot does something that it's not

555
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,600
supposed to

556
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,980
um you know so so there's a lot of

557
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,600
thought that goes into kind of the

558
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,000
securing of the robots and again

559
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,559
um you know it's a timing issue you know

560
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:20,760
how much how much time do you have to

561
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,400
kind of mess with that robot uh and and

562
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,020
kind of figure out you know how to hack

563
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,220
it

564
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:26,940
um

565
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,220
a completely autonomous robot like that

566
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,320
dog that we were looking at might not

567
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,179
have a lot of interfaces to it right

568
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:35,039
like there may not be a radio interface

569
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,900
that could be on purpose right like both

570
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,820
to make it quiet when it's going around

571
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,260
so you can't use like signals

572
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,480
intelligence to detect a robot

573
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,860
um but then you know again to kind of

574
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,419
reduce the hackability of the robot

575
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:46,799
right so

576
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,120
um so that that's completely a

577
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,440
possibility

578
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,880
um it could be that there's just a

579
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,860
physical interface to the robot and

580
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,840
again it it may be really tough to get

581
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,220
physically interfaced to the robot if

582
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,260
it's biting you or if it's beating on

583
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,960
you with something you know so uh so so

584
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,460
again you know

585
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,299
um

586
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:07,500
so so the the option is to kind of kill

587
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,840
the robot in another way right

588
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,700
um and so that's where we get to like uh

589
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,799
an electromagnet an electromagnetic

590
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:15,120
pulse right

591
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,120
um it's basically a a burst of electric

592
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,020
energy that will uh will disable or mess

593
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:25,200
with uh some sort of electronics right

594
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,460
um I probably don't need to tell anybody

595
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,500
here that there's all sorts of

596
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,120
electronics that you could use this on

597
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,980
so it's kind of the ultimate denial of

598
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:34,440
service honestly in some instances

599
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,179
um somebody brought up a really good uh

600
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:38,760
point that maybe there's the potential

601
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,400
for those uh those Key Systems where you

602
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,960
could basically blast it as you're going

603
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,760
by and you know disable it you know if

604
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,039
it's not a fail if it's not a failed

605
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,200
closed type of situation

606
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:49,919
um

607
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,900
but uh but yeah so so that was uh

608
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,360
so there's a there's kind of several

609
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,919
natural sources of uh uh uh EMP uh solar

610
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,919
flares uh or a super common one there's

611
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:06,900
there's typically a lot of chat about

612
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,000
the danger of like a really good solar

613
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,559
flare hitting us knocking out the

614
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,900
internet you know things like that uh

615
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,580
when you see the Northern Lights that's

616
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,960
a lot of what you're seeing right is

617
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,880
like basically like solar flare activity

618
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,860
hitting our our planet and kind of

619
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,659
getting getting shoved off by the

620
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:23,039
magnetics

621
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,440
um static discharge uh is actually a

622
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,260
form of EMP and uh um if you're old

623
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,299
school like I am and used to work on you

624
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:32,340
know PCS back in the 80s it was very

625
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:36,059
easy to uh to fry a PC just because you

626
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:37,380
know you'd walk around on the carpet a

627
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,520
little bit and then you go touch a ram

628
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,440
chip and the Ram's dead because it was

629
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,659
just a little a little shock

630
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:43,440
um

631
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,600
probably not a great way to disable a

632
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,460
robot you know like because you've got

633
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,140
to shuffle your feet a lot and you know

634
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,360
you gotta run after them but

635
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,120
um uh lightning is also a form of uh EMP

636
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,720
right like uh you can do a lot of a

637
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,340
direct strike lightning strike against

638
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,900
like an electrical thing something like

639
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,340
that this happens a lot where it'll

640
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:05,520
it'll disable a decent portion of uh

641
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,679
um electricity kind of in the area

642
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,360
um they there are military applications

643
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,500
for emps uh uh uh the North Korean guy

644
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,140
uh is uh is famous for threatening us

645
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,400
with this

646
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,140
um not only are there specific devices

647
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,780
that do this but a nuclear strike at a

648
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,580
high altitude

649
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,320
um would would do a whole ton of damage

650
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,140
I've seen I've seen like heat Maps

651
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,059
basically where like if you did one over

652
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:38,400
New York and it would not only basically

653
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,320
kill you know most of New York but like

654
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,039
a decent you know uh pitch around it so

655
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:44,940
um

656
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,280
and potentially I don't say more

657
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,020
damaging than an actual strike but you

658
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,100
know again if you if you're real

659
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,840
selective with a couple of these you

660
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,340
don't do a lot of Civilian damage but

661
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,140
you basically knock power out there's

662
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,820
there's been some really good examples

663
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,200
like when the power went out in New York

664
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,600
the one time it doesn't take long for

665
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,520
the wheels to fall off right like just

666
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,919
people start going crazy so

667
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:07,620
um you know uh there is

668
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,679
devices like this that are uh remote uh

669
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:13,020
or not not remote but mobile right and

670
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,000
and again part of what we'll get to on

671
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,980
the designs uh

672
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,900
um the portable aspect of it gets a

673
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,340
little questionable and this is the same

674
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,200
trouble I had when I was doing my drone

675
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,720
uh my drone research batteries and

676
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,720
capacitors are very heavy right so you

677
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,320
know as you scale up your uh uh your K

678
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,059
Your Capacity

679
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:35,580
um the the weight typically goes up uh

680
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,960
quite a bit that's kind of the thing

681
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,220
with the Teslas now right is they're

682
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,840
very heavy right because and it's

683
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,100
because all the batteries that are in

684
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,220
them so uh you know so setups like this

685
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,720
um they even have a similar setup I've

686
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,919
seen where they use it for crowd

687
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:48,720
dispersion it's got like a almost like a

688
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,700
microwave signal that it'll use and you

689
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,380
can kind of direct it at crowds and get

690
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,820
people to

691
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,780
um

692
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:58,799
uh go go away probably so

693
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,559
um so how am I doing okay so uh so on

694
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:03,299
onto the designs so again I've been

695
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:04,740
sitting on this talk probably for a

696
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,539
couple of years

697
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:08,640
um uh the the big thing was that I just

698
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,220
didn't think it would be as fun uh over

699
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,200
video and I wasn't convinced that I

700
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,120
wasn't going to fry my video feed as I

701
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,919
was doing my presentation which is kind

702
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:18,480
of a complication here which is why I'm

703
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,640
gonna be a little bit away

704
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,200
um uh

705
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,480
this should be pretty low power stuff

706
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,539
right um but uh but we're gonna talk

707
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:28,980
through a couple of caveats here that I

708
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,480
ran into

709
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,200
um

710
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,860
quick uh quick quote uh research is what

711
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:35,820
I'm doing when I don't know what I'm

712
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:38,340
doing it's one of my favorite quotes uh

713
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,559
um I really feel like stuff like this

714
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,679
especially is just kind of a grab bag of

715
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,360
let's go try some stuff let's see what

716
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,640
works you know it's it's it's it's not

717
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,520
it it never feels like a science project

718
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,500
it feels like an art project right like

719
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,480
you're just kind of like trying things

720
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,480
on uh so so that's one of my favorite

721
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,779
quotes

722
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:04,440
so a basic EMP design and give me one

723
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,500
second

724
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,640
so that that was my first design

725
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,320
basically right

726
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,840
um there's there's really just some

727
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,720
simple components to a basic EMP right

728
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,840
like you need a mechanism to charge

729
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,460
um you typically need some sort of

730
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,840
capacitor and the reason you need a

731
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,460
capacitor is because you need to kind of

732
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,679
get all the charge built up and then you

733
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,419
need to quickly you know kind of

734
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:36,299
disperse it right so it turns out uh on

735
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:40,620
this specific design uh that the uh um

736
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,419
well I'll get to that in one second the

737
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:44,880
uh typically a magnetic coil which is

738
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,520
what you see kind of where the tape is

739
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,200
um it's it's actually magnetic wire

740
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,820
that's kind of cooled around it a bunch

741
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,679
to make the coil

742
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:53,340
um

743
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,620
you need a switch that's just a light

744
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,480
switch from Home Depot for this this

745
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,400
specific design

746
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,100
um and then optionally you can you can

747
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,740
put in a high voltage generator my first

748
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,600
design did not have that my second one

749
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,400
does and I'll kind of show you the

750
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,960
difference

751
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,940
um but uh but that that's really all you

752
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:15,360
need everything after that is just a

753
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,120
matter of scale right so it's just

754
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:21,840
bigger capacitors bigger wire

755
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,960
um uh make a bigger boom so to speak for

756
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,179
for your EMP right so

757
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:29,340
um uh

758
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,919
so again design number one

759
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,340
um the capacitor actually came out of an

760
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,320
instant camera if you had told me you

761
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,120
could still buy an instant camera online

762
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,159
with film in it still I don't even know

763
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:42,779
where you'd go to get film processed

764
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:44,400
anymore I probably have to send it in

765
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,860
but it turns out that the the thing that

766
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,779
runs the flash on these is perfect

767
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:50,700
because it's a it's it's exactly that

768
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,779
kind of thing I'm talking about right

769
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:53,640
like you charge it up and then it's a

770
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,860
quick you know a quick quick shot which

771
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,440
is what does The Flash part right so

772
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,220
um

773
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,320
I will warn you you will shock the hell

774
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,299
out of yourself even on a low powered

775
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:04,440
thing like this

776
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,659
um that was one of the reasons

777
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:09,179
um you're way braver than I am if you

778
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:10,559
get more high power than what I've come

779
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,360
up with up here because even just that

780
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,460
little bit of juice like really got me I

781
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:17,580
had a full head of hair before uh uh but

782
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,960
before I did that

783
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,240
um that that picture that second uh

784
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,419
picture there is kind of the uh um the

785
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:26,340
actual capacitor out of it and then

786
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,260
again basically it's just a wire between

787
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,480
it's just wiring between the capacitor

788
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,840
on one side the switch the the coil on

789
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,240
the other side you put a battery in it

790
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,580
right just like uh you know like the the

791
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,799
uh the camera would have there's this

792
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:43,020
there's a button on the back you can't

793
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,360
really see it but uh you hit it to

794
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,340
charge the capacitor and then you just

795
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,799
flip the switch and uh and it basically

796
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:53,159
juices it this design is not uh

797
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:55,440
not very show friendly because there's

798
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,020
no nothing like really happens unless

799
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,880
you're like killing an electronic so it

800
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,039
readily killed Electronics

801
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:03,480
um and I had this whole thing about how

802
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,159
I was going to get up here and say is

803
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:07,140
super low powered it shouldn't do any

804
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,000
damage

805
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,059
um and then I ran into a problem

806
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:15,179
uh later that day

807
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:18,659
um my ring doorbell quit working uh

808
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:21,779
my ring doorbell was not super far from

809
00:29:21,779 --> 00:29:23,640
where I was firing this off my office is

810
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,899
actually at the front of the house so

811
00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:26,640
there's probably like a three to four

812
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,460
foot distance between me and at least

813
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,080
where the wiring was for the ring

814
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,480
doorbell I I couldn't believe it like

815
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,760
I'm literally like there's no effing way

816
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,799
I killed my ring doorbell

817
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:39,360
um but I tried everything the the device

818
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,120
is completely dead right like um uh I

819
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,440
think I might have I don't know if I

820
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,820
brought it with me but

821
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:47,580
um I checked all the voltages uh at both

822
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:50,460
the uh where the chime is and the door I

823
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,440
had plenty of juice it's just the device

824
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,000
was completely dead

825
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,140
um I'm sure it's completely a

826
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,340
coincidence I don't want to make anybody

827
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,960
nervous about what I'm about to do here

828
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,260
but um but but again so uh when I say

829
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,659
this is my most expensive talk ever it

830
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:06,419
really is because the actual device is

831
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:09,240
probably ten dollars in Parts uh but

832
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,399
then it cost me 280 bucks to replace my

833
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:14,399
stupid uh my stupid ring doorbell so

834
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:15,179
um

835
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:17,159
so yeah look luckily there's a really

836
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:18,539
good expense reimbursement program

837
00:30:18,539 --> 00:30:21,000
through b-sides so

838
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,919
um I was glad Aaron picked that up for

839
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:23,880
me

840
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,880
um

841
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:30,240
so so I I like that design it's still

842
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,039
it's still kind of clunky

843
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:32,700
um

844
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,159
there's a guy online that uh does these

845
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:37,980
uh tasers actually and I was like a

846
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,960
taser is perfect and there's a couple

847
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,000
things that make it perfect right

848
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,419
um again it's uh it's portable uh it's

849
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:48,600
got uh um uh basically the thing in the

850
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,899
middle there is a uh what they call a

851
00:30:51,899 --> 00:30:53,880
boost step up power module high voltage

852
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:57,179
generator so uh what comes in on the end

853
00:30:57,179 --> 00:30:58,860
is basically nine volts what comes out

854
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,960
on the other side is is significantly

855
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,520
more it turns it into a square wave

856
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,980
which is kind of what we need for this

857
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,899
um there's some capacitance in the end

858
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:08,100
of it

859
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:08,820
um

860
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,980
I had some extra capacitors in it and I

861
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,299
took it out because again I don't want

862
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:13,440
to kill anyone

863
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,059
um uh especially Aaron Aaron's gonna

864
00:31:15,059 --> 00:31:16,740
come up here and help me with this

865
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:21,720
um so uh but it uh um uh basically what

866
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,059
you do is you uh you take apart a nine

867
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:27,240
volt battery you take the top of it and

868
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,159
use that as your new plug and then

869
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:31,260
that's the plug for the bottom you wire

870
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:34,080
up the uh the thing to your uh your

871
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,760
voltage generator

872
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,700
um and then if you have the uh um the

873
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:42,740
wires at the perfect amount part

874
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:46,559
then then you'll get a little spark on

875
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,360
the end and it's it's literally a

876
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,000
functional uh taser which is great for

877
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,860
nerds like if somebody's beating you up

878
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,299
at the bar you just get this thing out

879
00:31:54,299 --> 00:31:57,539
it's it's a it is perfectly fine right

880
00:31:57,539 --> 00:31:59,039
um basically what you do to this thing

881
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:02,159
is you add uh um you add the coil so

882
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:04,020
I've got a coil over here

883
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,640
um and then and then it's a functional

884
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,799
EMP at that point right same kind of

885
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:09,899
thing you get kind of a build up of

886
00:32:09,899 --> 00:32:11,760
electricity it kind of shoots it out all

887
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,940
at once uh magnetizes the coil and you

888
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:20,059
get kind of an EMP effect right so um

889
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:23,880
and then one more slide again wolf had

890
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,260
almost The Identical picture on his

891
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,360
slides I swear we weren't we didn't

892
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,980
coordinate this but

893
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:32,880
um so uh so one of the big things is uh

894
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,679
um we're protective gear when you're

895
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:36,539
doing this I learned this the hard way I

896
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:39,120
was uh um I I've Juiced myself pretty

897
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,500
good on this a couple times at this

898
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,179
point especially when you're you're

899
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:44,039
wiring it

900
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:45,299
um

901
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:47,340
rest in peace to my ring doorbell be

902
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,779
really careful with these like what you

903
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:49,919
have it around

904
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,960
um even low power I think can can do

905
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,120
some damage so

906
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,220
um

907
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,659
uh a device like this is probably

908
00:32:57,659 --> 00:32:59,279
illegal

909
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:02,039
um and uh luckily we're not streaming

910
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:03,240
this and there's gonna be no YouTube

911
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:07,200
video so I feel fine but um but yeah

912
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,840
it's it's definitely like frowned upon

913
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,520
by the FCC

914
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,960
um I think

915
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,240
in a low power situation like this where

916
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,740
we're not actually killing an electronic

917
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,840
I'm going to demo it here in a second uh

918
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:22,200
uh we're you know uh we're fine if I

919
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,840
disappear this is what happened

920
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,760
um you know so

921
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,080
um and then and then kind of the big

922
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,519
thing and this was this is really kind

923
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,080
of the same thing that I learned on my

924
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,000
drone project is

925
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,460
um batteries are heavy right so like

926
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:38,940
getting a good mix of like the right

927
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,460
power output on stuff with the right

928
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,679
amount of battery

929
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,740
um uh you know is is difficult so you'll

930
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,840
see how I scratched out portable

931
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,880
um I should have just called it a

932
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,640
practicable practical short range

933
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,039
um now all this being said if if I was

934
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:58,080
in a real situation where a robot dog is

935
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,059
going to be taking over my house I think

936
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:01,980
you you could potentially set up a

937
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,980
device that's kind of more stationary

938
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:07,740
more like an IED let's say

939
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,540
um and be able to you know have have

940
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,639
much more capacity like at a specific

941
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:13,080
spot but

942
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,119
um but again you know to to have enough

943
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,300
juice to really do damn do real damage

944
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,679
to one of those robots I think you would

945
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:20,940
you're going to need a pretty hefty

946
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,440
device so

947
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,599
um my buddy my buddy Jason had sent me a

948
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:27,060
picture of uh is like a I guess you put

949
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,800
shells in there it's like this vest and

950
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,899
I'm like man that seems great but boy if

951
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:32,159
that thing goes off when you're wearing

952
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,440
that you would uh your your Electrify

953
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,719
your head off basically so

954
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,219
um

955
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:39,780
so

956
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:42,619
um no questions yet

957
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:51,740
I'm staying away from everything hang on

958
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:56,699
so so it's it's it's pretty it's it's a

959
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:58,560
it's got pretty good juice to it

960
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,060
actually Aaron I need I need you real

961
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,140
quick here

962
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,259
um

963
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,200
I'm moving my laptop

964
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,979
foreign

965
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,000
so originally I had this whole bit where

966
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,520
I was going to put on a rick outfit

967
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,380
um and then I was like What if I catch

968
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:37,140
my hair on fire like you know

969
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,060
um but I gotta flask for it and I was

970
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,380
like well that this is still going to

971
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:43,760
kind of take the edge off of the uh

972
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:46,920
banana sipping cream right it goes good

973
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,200
in your coffee in the morning by the way

974
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,380
not not when you got to go to work so

975
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,579
um

976
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:55,079
oh

977
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:58,579
we need something to kill right

978
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,520
[Laughter]

979
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,300
sorry wolf

980
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,700
so that is an x-59 uh no I have no idea

981
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,440
it was literally the toaster from home

982
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,760
I'm not actually gonna frying my toaster

983
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,420
I was just being funny

984
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,700
foreign

985
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:36,900
on this device is like two nails

986
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,359
framing nails that are standing up no no

987
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,280
please none of the Builder space look

988
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,980
really closely at my uh my soldering

989
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:47,520
here please like yeah I'm I'm not good

990
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,040
um so my buddy Patrick actually turned

991
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,480
me onto this idea which was which was

992
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,320
great

993
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,180
um this is an old-timey kind of radio

994
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,880
this thing costs like ten dollars

995
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,420
um what's nice about it is you'll you

996
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,460
know you can see the spark once I once I

997
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,839
wire the coil up there's not gonna be a

998
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:05,339
spark to it anymore because the all

999
00:37:05,339 --> 00:37:07,560
everything's going through the coil

1000
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,720
um but what's nice about this is I can

1001
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,060
turn the radio on uh and you'll be able

1002
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,740
to hear kind of the interruption and the

1003
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,599
electronics and the signal is this as

1004
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,680
this happens so

1005
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,920
it could have been a thong or something

1006
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,319
perhaps

1007
00:38:11,339 --> 00:38:14,480
get cash back

1008
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:22,339
foreign

1009
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,099
thank you it's a nice way to kind of be

1010
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:02,480
able to hear the actual EMTs

1011
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,500
look nobody was killed that was great so

1012
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,339
we're about out of time anybody have any

1013
00:39:17,339 --> 00:39:19,500
quick questions before uh before us get

1014
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,780
out all it is it is happy hour so I

1015
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:25,760
bought drinks for everyone Scott

1016
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:35,820
so so so older older type of electronics

1017
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:38,040
are going to fall over easier right but

1018
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,079
it's literally it's literally not any

1019
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:41,640
different than like that static

1020
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,020
discharge I was talking about like when

1021
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,940
you touch RAM chips like it's just

1022
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:47,099
taking the bits and basically just you

1023
00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:49,200
know uh uh you know just just

1024
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,119
electrifying it it's just more there's

1025
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:52,920
more of a field to it because of the EMP

1026
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,560
right there's more of a burst so kind of

1027
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,660
kind of similar to an electrostatic

1028
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:00,060
charge it's it's short right like

1029
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:02,280
there's there's a short range to it

1030
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,079
um you can make these things directional

1031
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:05,820
a little bit by by basically like

1032
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,680
attaching a big pipe to it and a whole

1033
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,020
bunch of coil and it'll shoot

1034
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,820
um again I don't wreck I don't recommend

1035
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,560
that one either but yeah it's just it's

1036
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,880
just kind of frying the electronics

1037
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,099
older older older like transistor type

1038
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:19,500
of stuff will actually die

1039
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,020
um newer newer stuff especially like

1040
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,460
solid state

1041
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,960
um you're just going to kind of jumble

1042
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,220
the bits and I think I think you could

1043
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:28,140
probably even go back and like reset the

1044
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,880
uh you know like a flash drive or

1045
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,900
something like that would probably still

1046
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:34,880
be fine but but yeah so

1047
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,200
yeah no I like I like I like the way you

1048
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:47,299
think next talk next talk

1049
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:53,579
I think next year next year this one is

1050
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:55,380
going to be out here so did you have

1051
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,520
some

1052
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:00,440
[Laughter]

1053
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,940
I'll let you know

1054
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:12,320
that's a yeah

1055
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:21,119
that's a really good question I would so

1056
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,040
the thing is is like uh

1057
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,780
um that was one of my other like covid

1058
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:27,180
projects was like uh got a kit and I

1059
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:29,640
built an electric guitar so

1060
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,260
um but yeah the way it's kind of wired

1061
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,339
through and everything I would think you

1062
00:41:32,339 --> 00:41:34,020
might be able to like as you were

1063
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:37,079
playing you you might hear uh hear some

1064
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:38,579
of the disturbance from the electricity

1065
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,920
I I could try that like yeah that's

1066
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,339
interesting

1067
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:48,200
no

1068
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,520
I'm gonna have to try this no that's

1069
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:59,099
interesting yeah yeah I'm I'm sure it

1070
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:00,180
would do something I just don't know

1071
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:02,339
what it would sound like or if it would

1072
00:42:02,339 --> 00:42:03,960
actually damage like the pickups or

1073
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:08,240
something I I wouldn't think so but yeah

1074
00:42:08,839 --> 00:42:12,259
I'm telling you

1075
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,820
yeah anybody yeah go ahead yeah

1076
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:17,359
right

1077
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,619
the the

1078
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:24,599
um the the coil is is quite a bit away

1079
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:27,180
from the device for one

1080
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:29,660
um uh and and everything

1081
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:32,400
all I don't know if this makes sense all

1082
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,200
the electricity is going this way right

1083
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,740
so basically I'm going from Battery it's

1084
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,000
it's coming through the wires the

1085
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,680
voltage booster is basically pushing it

1086
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,599
out the wires this way

1087
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:44,780
um and then it's coming down the coil so

1088
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:47,400
even any of the directionality is is

1089
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,800
should be pretty kind of focused right

1090
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,900
within the uh the coil right there if

1091
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:55,280
that makes sense so yeah

1092
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,079
thanks guys for having me uh super

1093
00:42:58,079 --> 00:42:59,940
awesome to have b-sides in person again

1094
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:03,250
love you guys

1095
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:06,429
[Applause]

1096
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,440
my only feedback was that was not

1097
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,390
tequila

1098
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:20,579
[Laughter]

1099
00:43:20,579 --> 00:43:22,200
awesome

1100
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,960
um Mike also has Great War Stories too

1101
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,640
um ask him about his war-diling days

1102
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,740
he'll be more than happy to tell you

1103
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,599
about him

1104
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:32,220
cool

1105
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:35,000
um so

1106
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:40,520
yeah 2022 we did
