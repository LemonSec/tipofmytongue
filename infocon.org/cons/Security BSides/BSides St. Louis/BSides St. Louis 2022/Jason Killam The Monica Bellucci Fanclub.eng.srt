1
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,140
space bar

2
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,320
once you've come up with this title

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,379
uh

4
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,040
I like Nissan Monica yeah

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,280
and it's Jason killer yeah

6
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,200
okie dokie

7
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,360
ready to keep it moving

8
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,520
some awesome talks

9
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,979
a couple more and hopefully a live

10
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:21,299
demonstration at the very ends

11
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:23,340
that should be pretty fun

12
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,280
okay uh this is the Monica Bellucci fan

13
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,280
club uh from Jason killum from Red

14
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,119
Canary Red Canary in the house

15
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,799
and uh

16
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,340
let's let's let's hear it take it away

17
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,400
hi so my name is Jason killum uh I'm

18
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,600
going to be talking about the Monica

19
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,299
Bellucci fan club it's really cool

20
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:47,759
but uh it's actually about the detection

21
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,579
defense lessons I learned at least and I

22
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:51,960
think a lot of people could learn from

23
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,000
looking through the trickbot Forum data

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,380
and we'll get to why it's called this

25
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,700
here in a second

26
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,200
so uh I work at Red Canary I do make

27
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,140
I make detection rules at Red Canary I'm

28
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,020
a detection engineer so uh as as they

29
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,660
say we eat our own dog food so I write

30
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,520
the rules and then I work the queue and

31
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,860
I deal with the bad rules and the good

32
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,800
rules and whatever so

33
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,720
um I've seen we see we have some

34
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,520
customers that different

35
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,200
so we onboard customers in different

36
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,940
stages sometimes they are our customers

37
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,260
meaning they're in the middle of a

38
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,720
dumpster fire and some customers think

39
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,739
there's something about to happen so

40
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:29,879
there's maybe a little bit of a dumpster

41
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:31,200
fire happening

42
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,420
or maybe the dumpster fire smoldering

43
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,860
and they kind of put it out but there's

44
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,480
there's still some stuff going on their

45
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,440
environment and they have to have

46
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,180
somebody monitor it so that's what we do

47
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,040
sometimes or it's just regular customers

48
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,420
with that want to have good security

49
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,620
monitoring

50
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,620
so I'm also an Air Force cyber operator

51
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,760
uh as people say it's I'm a 1b4 uh I'm a

52
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:56,640
I'm a lead one before cyber guy and I

53
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,980
actually went to the air I'm actually uh

54
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,080
my unit is here kind of local on Scott

55
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,900
Air Force Base and our unit went to

56
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,180
Italy for an OP I came back with only

57
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,099
four bottles of wine there were some

58
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:09,300
people in my group that came back with

59
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,920
24 bottles of wine in their in their

60
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,239
suitcases which apparently there's no

61
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,099
limit and I kind of regret I didn't come

62
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:15,540
back with that many

63
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,319
um

64
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,540
should have got more uh yeah and like I

65
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,040
said I'm like a moth to a dumpster fire

66
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,440
in that like all these when these

67
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,599
companies have these things happen I

68
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:25,620
kind of

69
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,260
lurk and dig through the data in our

70
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,300
Splunk instance and I like to kind of

71
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,500
understand

72
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,599
everything these guys did because I want

73
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,239
to know if we missed something or

74
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,620
if there's something we could detect

75
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,440
better or to stop them faster or if

76
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,879
there was nothing we could have done

77
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,200
because it was already game over with

78
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,760
these kind of people

79
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,140
so

80
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:50,340
uh an overview for this so to me

81
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,739
any if regardless of where you what you

82
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:54,360
do in infosec I think people could pull

83
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,980
something cool from the data I'm going

84
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,900
to show you and you can look it for it

85
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,099
through yourself and I'll show you how

86
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:00,780
to do that here

87
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,760
um so if you're a red teamer this is

88
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,000
kind of literally a red team manual for

89
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,500
them so there's a lot of stuff there

90
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,480
that you can do

91
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,420
um a pent uh or a stock analyst these

92
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,439
are all things you should be looking for

93
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,939
if you're a ciso there's a lot of

94
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:16,978
security policy kind of stuff in here

95
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:19,680
sort of to me that I could kind of see

96
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,860
and also the other question is like this

97
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,960
Conti trick bot these guys have

98
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,940
disbanded so they're gone right like

99
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,860
they're not going to ever come back so

100
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,540
why would I even bother looking at this

101
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,120
or talking about this well these guys

102
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,000
are gone but most of them either they

103
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,919
Rebrand under a different name and it's

104
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,440
exactly the same thing or they just

105
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,820
scatter to different groups and they

106
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,440
take their techniques with them and

107
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,080
rinse and repeat so

108
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,780
the situation in February

109
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,759
people aren't living under a rock you

110
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:53,940
you Russia invaded Ukraine and the

111
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,400
trickbot Conti group actually pledged

112
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,960
allegiance to Russia and said anybody

113
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,240
that attacks recurring is going to get

114
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,060
attacked by us this guy uh Conti leagues

115
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,100
we don't know his actual name

116
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,759
um but he's like okay and he I guess he

117
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:09,960
was in the middle of their somehow

118
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,820
infiltrated their group a little bit and

119
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,720
he dumped everything online and uh I

120
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,220
didn't know who he was at first and then

121
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:20,400
actually uh I started like his last post

122
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,900
is about how he did an interview with

123
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,199
CNN and the FBI I guess messaged him and

124
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,660
said hey could you stop dumping all this

125
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,880
data online he's like okay fine I guess

126
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,600
I'll I'll stop but uh yeah he has he's

127
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,800
pretty

128
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,900
interesting and he basically says Glory

129
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,340
Ukraine I'm gonna go find the front

130
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,300
lines

131
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,199
and dumps all this stuff online so

132
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,240
um

133
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,160
I want to talk if people keep up with

134
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,220
this stuff when it came out uh Krebs on

135
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,360
security

136
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,639
uh kind of talked about the chat logs

137
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:54,780
and some other stuff about the

138
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,280
interpersonal relationships and how they

139
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,139
like work together who manages who the

140
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:01,139
names of these people that stuff's cool

141
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:03,419
but like not interesting to me there was

142
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:04,820
actually a whole section

143
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,520
set of files for the Forum leak for

144
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,020
that's that one I've gotten a little red

145
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,180
box that's the part that was interesting

146
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,560
to me because that's the handbook that's

147
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,500
like their uh operator's manual so

148
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,240
that's cool to me so it had lots of

149
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,039
tools walkthroughs command lines guides

150
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:22,139
for privilege escalation how to delete

151
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:24,120
backups whole bunch of stuff

152
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,380
so

153
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,360
but it's in Russian and I don't read

154
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,960
Russian I'm yeah yeah no that's all I

155
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,080
know and it's split across a bunch of

156
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,720
text files so like I'm gonna open every

157
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,740
single text file and look through

158
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,600
there's like uh I don't remember how

159
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,600
many like 100 or so text files are split

160
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,780
across different web pages of this guide

161
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,060
this forum so

162
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,160
enter Google translate and this guy on

163
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,680
the on GitHub called the parmac that's

164
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,000
the link there at the bottom this is

165
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,259
kind of where I started with this data

166
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:57,300
because I saw it was on it was Google

167
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,419
translated and I was like oh cool I

168
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:01,800
could just open this data and start

169
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,120
looking through it

170
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,400
so and then I piped them all to text

171
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,280
files and I mean if you're doing this uh

172
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,900
don't forget to

173
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,759
put it in a different folder other than

174
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,360
the folder you're sending it to because

175
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,880
uh if you know how a loop works it like

176
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,740
finds all the text files and then finds

177
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,360
a new text file and starts appending the

178
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,740
stuff from that text file and then yeah

179
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,780
you end up with a 8 gig text file which

180
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,880
doesn't go well

181
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,539
so Monica Bellucci is apparently the

182
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:32,220
title of the Forum

183
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,740
says Lamonica Bellucci fan club and it's

184
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,860
in there I I did a word count 148 times

185
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,360
and I'm guessing that's for every time

186
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,880
the time the title of the page and the

187
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,400
the breadcrumbs to the page or at the

188
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,199
bottom so I had to delete it out of

189
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,520
there a bunch of times it was very

190
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,319
annoying and I just thought it was funny

191
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:51,120
that they're like literally hosting a

192
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,120
guidebook for this for their their

193
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,360
hacking stuff on a forum named I was

194
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,639
named for the for this freaking Italian

195
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:02,340
actress which I thought was pretty funny

196
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,139
so yeah I think it was how they just the

197
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:06,660
guy whoever stole the data was just on

198
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,360
the site copy the data control a the

199
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,280
whole page and dumped everything he

200
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,780
could

201
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,720
so the tools that they use is generally

202
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,000
speaking from from theirs they use a lot

203
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,800
of lull bins which for people aren't

204
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,479
aware as tools that are already on

205
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:25,500
Windows by default so net and I'll test

206
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,120
and Powershell are the big ones

207
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,919
obviously that I specifically saw

208
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:30,660
mentioned

209
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,159
um some traditional red tubing tools

210
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,479
that you'll see you see a lot these days

211
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,299
Cobalt strike Ruby is seat belt and

212
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:37,260
Chrome

213
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,320
uh and then some abused sysadmin tools

214
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,839
uh that I don't see much from Red teams

215
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:44,580
I think because these tools are kind of

216
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,620
more how they accomplish some goals that

217
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,660
a red team wouldn't typically need to do

218
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,300
but our clone for x-filling data and

219
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,519
grock and AD fine for enumerating the

220
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,260
network uh and then some remote access

221
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,820
tools they use

222
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,800
any desks mostly was mentioned in there

223
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,399
but like I've Splashtop a Terra

224
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,980
um I think I've seen a new one is um

225
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,320
Synchro or something like that like they

226
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,000
just rotate through them if you if you

227
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,160
blacklist one then they'll just start

228
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,140
using another so any desk is the one I

229
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,580
mentioned specifically but there's a lot

230
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,200
more

231
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,300
so some of the specific stuff for lull

232
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,240
bins they use is net commands so if you

233
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,519
if you want to find the domain admins

234
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,459
for the network you do net users domain

235
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:27,899
admins and you get the list of domain

236
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:29,100
elements for the domain so they'll run

237
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,440
that a lot to find a domain admin

238
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,940
because that's the first thing they want

239
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,740
is domain admin privileges just like any

240
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,959
pet tester once so and the other thing

241
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,760
they want is they want to find where the

242
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,260
domain controller is so they'll use the

243
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,560
tool they'll use nltest to do run DC

244
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,839
list and they'll find the the domain

245
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,360
controller and how to get to it and

246
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,060
log on to it and do whatever they want

247
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,680
another one I see sometimes is the

248
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,779
domain trusts all trusts and trusted

249
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:56,399
domains I see those sometimes with like

250
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,040
qbot which is another

251
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,080
which is would be like the precursor to

252
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,820
this so you have to imagine that this is

253
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,519
like the bad guy has the a bot on the

254
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,800
network already like qbot is one

255
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,140
trickbot was the older one

256
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,600
um whatever it is ice ID or something

257
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,040
like that

258
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,660
so one of the first tools that they

259
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,860
mentioned and it has like the whole

260
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,600
entire script for this is called sub

261
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,240
drill uh it's it's probably something

262
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,500
that red teamers here are probably

263
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,120
familiar with I'm not as familiar with

264
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,740
it but like it's basically a script to

265
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,660
enumerate all the

266
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,420
ocent about sub domains that they have

267
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,279
available to them so they it'll

268
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:34,440
basically take a domain and it'll spit

269
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,180
out all the sub domains for that domain

270
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,860
and you can drill into their subdomains

271
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,500
that's hence the name so it looks

272
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,480
through like URLs can

273
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,579
um I think the way back machine and some

274
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:47,279
other stuff like that

275
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,440
and Cobalt strike which is probably not

276
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,600
a surprise to anybody here uh or at

277
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,519
least anybody that's into this kind of

278
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,040
stuff like me uh it's pretty Infamous

279
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,899
for this it's like pretty much anything

280
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:00,180
any kind of malware dropper you see out

281
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,920
there these days if you follow Brad

282
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,740
Duncan on Twitter or malware traffic

283
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,660
it's everything leads to Cobalt strike

284
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,459
pretty much well that's sort of changing

285
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,600
now but

286
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,100
I mean at this time pretty much

287
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,079
everything was Cobalt strike and most of

288
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:14,339
the documentation and their stuff was

289
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:16,980
like how to set up a server uh they have

290
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,959
like their their settings for their

291
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,620
server is like a Ubuntu Server uh with

292
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,500
like this this much RAM

293
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,240
um and this much storage and that kind

294
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,920
of stuff and the processor I don't

295
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,480
remember what it was but like and then

296
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,800
it just has a whole bunch of scripts on

297
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,959
how to set it up and how to basically

298
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:35,579
get it started

299
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:37,440
so the next so one of the things they do

300
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,880
with Cobalt strike is they use some tool

301
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,220
a tool called C2 concealer which is a

302
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,200
tool from 40 North and I think you'll

303
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,339
kind of start to see a theme here

304
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:46,079
everything's just pulled from some other

305
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,720
some other GitHub some other source so

306
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,360
like they they've they're just really

307
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,700
good red teamers that you know don't

308
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,800
provide a report at the end but uh

309
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,600
they're from personal experience of

310
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,100
seeing Cobalt strike

311
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,440
uh they can do these things to make

312
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,300
their Cobalt strike really stealthy and

313
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,740
do all sorts of stuff to make it blend

314
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,200
in with like normal traffic but a lot of

315
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,940
the times they don't like for instance

316
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,560
the default

317
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,540
for Cobalt strike is the spawn to run D

318
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,899
level 32 without a command line and if

319
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:18,180
you've ever looked at run dl32 it

320
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,800
usually has a command line for something

321
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,740
to run a dll as it kind of sounds like

322
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,839
so you'll usually see a command line

323
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:27,120
with it so it's kind of weird if you see

324
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,440
it without one and making network

325
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,000
connections because that doesn't make

326
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,339
any sense

327
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:34,680
yeah so here's some other examples uh

328
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,420
this is a cool Twitter account it's

329
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,220
called Cobalt strike bot and it's just

330
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,200
some I don't know who runs it but like

331
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,260
they just find Cobalt strike beacons on

332
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,899
probably virus total and then they post

333
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:47,339
the Spawn Two values which are the

334
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:49,200
command lines that these actually are so

335
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,120
like in this case run dll 32 is the top

336
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,820
one that they use the most dll host is

337
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,519
another common one all those so

338
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:58,980
uh we have a pretty good blog at Red

339
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,500
Canary about how to detect Cobalt strike

340
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,240
there's stuff like name pipes

341
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,360
that run dll 32 thing a whole bunch of

342
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,920
stuff you can just look for kind of the

343
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,600
default behavior for Cobalt strike and

344
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,860
even if they

345
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,139
remove one default Behavior sometimes

346
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:15,540
they forget another so it's good to try

347
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,440
to

348
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,000
look for those things because it's

349
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,800
probably going to result in some good

350
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,420
stuff

351
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,060
another tool they use is tor so most

352
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,019
people think when they think tour

353
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:27,600
they're thinking of it as traffic I want

354
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,120
to anonymize my traffic going out these

355
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,680
guys generally use it to anonymize their

356
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,680
traffic coming in so they'll they had

357
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,920
kind of a lengthy guide of text on you

358
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,680
set up the tour client and then you get

359
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,459
your you basically set up a onion web

360
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:47,160
server address to remote back in but

361
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,540
instead of hosting a web server they're

362
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,660
hosting SSH RDP to remote into the

363
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,459
server to remote into that workstation

364
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:56,700
or server they need to get onto so

365
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,800
yeah and they'll they'll usually set

366
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,200
these with like netsh rules or uh

367
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,300
Powershell rule to just for allow the

368
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,639
traffic in

369
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:07,740
so here's an example uh in this case

370
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,779
yeah that's not Google updates.exe

371
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:11,820
people could probably guess this is

372
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,579
actually tour.exe uh if you look up a

373
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:16,560
hash for it it's funny I should probably

374
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,120
included a screenshot of this but on

375
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,480
virus total Tor itself has zero out of

376
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,420
whatever on on virus total so it's not

377
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,940
going to come up as malicious in your in

378
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,920
your logs so it's kind of interesting

379
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,620
from that perspective and the other

380
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,779
options there those allow it to run as a

381
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:35,940
service as a like a system thing that's

382
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,440
kind of actually one one reason why it's

383
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,820
running out of the windows folder not

384
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,040
like a user folder

385
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,440
um and then this Tech F option with that

386
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,019
text file that's the tour like config so

387
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:47,639
that has like

388
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:49,860
trust these nodes don't do this thing do

389
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,660
do that so

390
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,820
um if you kind of look for those things

391
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,699
you can usually find tour for those

392
00:14:56,699 --> 00:14:58,260
options

393
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,760
um also a thing that helped me a lot was

394
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,160
I found like the online guide command

395
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,199
line guide for tour from like Debian or

396
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:05,459
something like that and it kind of gates

397
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:07,519
some other command lines that are

398
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,199
probable and also there's also some

399
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:14,519
files that get to here here so also when

400
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:16,920
Tor runs it actually creates a couple

401
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,959
files that are related to like it's it's

402
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,779
running there's the state lock file and

403
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:24,660
this cached micro desk Consensus These

404
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,040
are all kind of files that they need for

405
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,360
operation

406
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,220
and when it's running a system it's not

407
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,540
going to be in a user folder it'll be

408
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:33,060
under like it's still under app data

409
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,139
roaming but there's like a service

410
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:36,480
profiles folder that'll run in

411
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,579
but if it's under a running if it's

412
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:40,560
running under a user context it'll run

413
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,880
under

414
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,160
um that app data roaming folder which

415
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,720
people if people have ever worked on a

416
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,940
Windows system

417
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,860
if your user name

418
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,660
documents and stuff like that instead of

419
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,100
going to documents you go to app data

420
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,180
and that's where all this stuff is

421
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,519
residing so you look for these files

422
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:59,339
popping up on a box and the binary is

423
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:01,740
not named tour that's really bad or it's

424
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,959
I think it's the brave browser and some

425
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:06,480
other stuff uses it but like there's a

426
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,060
pretty small set of actual legitimate

427
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,260
things but again if somebody's running

428
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,579
Tor on your network that's probably a

429
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:14,639
concern anyways so

430
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,459
uh and then another so what they'll do

431
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:18,959
with Tor and engrock which is another

432
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,399
one I'll get to in a second is they'll

433
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,980
basically use it to set up a back door

434
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:25,680
so the script that they have basically

435
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,279
downloads Tor from the tour project and

436
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,860
then copies it into Windows Temp and

437
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,740
renames it to sysmon so again if you run

438
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,180
if you're running system on probably

439
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,339
from the windows root folder like most

440
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:40,680
people do when it installs if you find

441
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,940
sysbon running from somewhere else

442
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,500
that's probably pretty weird and then

443
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,000
they'll and then they use the the not

444
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,639
sucking service manager which is nssm

445
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:50,899
this is kind of a tool to um

446
00:16:50,899 --> 00:16:53,820
manage services and create services on a

447
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,380
system so they kind of use it as a way

448
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,720
to create a service without doing the

449
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,980
service command line which I don't know

450
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,940
why they didn't bother doing that

451
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,500
because it's probably not that bad but

452
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,000
anyways

453
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,540
um then no install SSH so they'll

454
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,480
basically enable enable an SSH server on

455
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,160
that Windows computer and then they'll

456
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,280
start both the engrock process or sorry

457
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:18,839
the tour process and the SSH service and

458
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,059
make those new services and then they'll

459
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:22,799
create a firewall rule to allow those in

460
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,540
so

461
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,160
so ngrok is the other tool we're gonna

462
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,500
we're gonna talk about with it's just

463
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,240
they use it exactly like they use Tor is

464
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,799
sometimes they'll just use one over the

465
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:32,460
other

466
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,440
uh depending on you know if somebody's

467
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,880
looking for tour

468
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,440
traffic or something like that they

469
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,380
might switch to ngrok so engrock

470
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,360
it's actually kind of easier to detect

471
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,320
which I thought we thought was

472
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,179
interesting is like the domains it

473
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:46,919
always connects to engrock.io or

474
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:48,720
ngoc.com and we'll have some screenshots

475
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,400
because it's really easy to use anybody

476
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,559
can use this you can just go to engrock

477
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,100
site and create a free account and make

478
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,020
it and set up a

479
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,820
it gives you all the stuff to create a

480
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,919
tunnel so it's generally used if you

481
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,080
want to make host a web server that's

482
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,000
what kind of like lazy sis admins do

483
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,740
when they want to make a web server they

484
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,059
just start it on their box and they

485
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:10,559
create it in Rock

486
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,780
tunnel and then they allow port 80. in

487
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,740
this case they're allowing RDP or SSH on

488
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,340
for um for engrock

489
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,140
so yeah and then they rename it to

490
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,380
sysmon just like they did with a tour

491
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:28,080
so this is straight from the engrocks

492
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,880
website oh sorry let me get rid of that

493
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,360
VPN

494
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:36,299
sorry okay

495
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:38,640
all right so yeah this is straight from

496
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,380
the uh engrock's website they're like

497
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,559
it's so easy to sit up you just unzip it

498
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:45,720
you give it off token which is basically

499
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,520
the token that allows like the tunnel to

500
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,919
be encrypted and identifies that

501
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,200
tour ins that and rock instance to you

502
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,140
to your account and run it and there's

503
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,940
go that's pretty much how their whole

504
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,160
documentation with uh to set it up and

505
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,600
again they're like just starting then

506
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,940
you forward HTTP which in this case

507
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,080
they're not going to be doing that here

508
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,059
but

509
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:07,740
see how here's like their their

510
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,140
documentation on how to use on grok the

511
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,940
only official solution as they put in

512
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,320
parentheses which I thought was

513
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,760
interesting

514
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,440
um it's like one of the first entries in

515
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,940
this in the set of data whenever I

516
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,980
started when I gripped it when I created

517
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,860
one big text file so it was like okay

518
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,020
I've seen I actually we've actually we

519
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:28,080
actually see this as well uh this is um

520
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,940
that I'm using exactly the thing that

521
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,760
sysmon tunnel sysmon need binary for

522
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,400
ingrock and in this case they have some

523
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,760
options here they have started uh I'm

524
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,380
not I guess I'm not familiar with these

525
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,840
options as much as Tor but obviously

526
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,880
config is probably for the config for

527
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,039
engrock here so that makes sense at

528
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,900
least so yeah in this case

529
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,940
the auth token isn't in the command line

530
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,799
like it should we saw in our in grok

531
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,360
documentation it's actually inside that

532
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,880
that yaml file

533
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,980
and so remote access tools these are all

534
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,620
the rats that they have if anybody's

535
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,240
familiar with 90 cartoons that's rat

536
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,240
trap uh their documentation mostly calls

537
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,020
out any disk but again they I've seen a

538
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,780
lot of malware use net support at Terra

539
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,220
I've seen all these ransomware groups

540
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,840
rotate through just like I said just

541
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,820
they you get one blacklisted and then

542
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,500
they'll just drop another because they

543
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,960
have them all ready to go to switch to

544
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,080
so most and most legit rats

545
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,480
when they do stuff they usually call out

546
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,760
to their company the the software

547
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,620
company's domain

548
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,200
to pull down updates or netsup net

549
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,419
supports case it does it to uh get its

550
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:38,760
geolocation for the when it's reporting

551
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,679
to the server

552
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:43,919
um and then we are Ray Canary also has a

553
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,660
pretty good blog about legit rats this

554
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,039
one actually I helped co-author with

555
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,380
Justin schoenefeld

556
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,419
um it but basically what you're going to

557
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:53,580
look for with the Terra is like there's

558
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,380
an email address in the command line

559
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,240
that's kind of weird that if you don't

560
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,400
because sometimes when you set up a

561
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,280
Terra it uh you have to give it an

562
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,039
account to give in the the setup and he

563
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,240
just doesn't really have an option like

564
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,400
that so it's a bit more difficult net

565
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,140
support it always runs out of program

566
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:13,140
data so it's our program files so when

567
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,059
you see these binaries doing things that

568
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:16,799
they're not normally doing that's

569
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,440
usually a pretty big red flag for

570
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,960
to look into I mean if you see these in

571
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,580
your network and you don't use a Terra

572
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,559
net support or any desk that's probably

573
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:27,179
a huge red flag for you guys so it's

574
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:28,380
good to like

575
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,299
as they say get a software inventory of

576
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:31,740
what you actually use in your network so

577
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,059
you understand

578
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:34,919
what is normal and what is not normal

579
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,419
for your network because it's kind of

580
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:38,220
different for everybody

581
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,780
a next tool they use is called sharp

582
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,780
Chrome again this is kind of a red team

583
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:44,520
tool I don't think I've seen as many red

584
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,799
teams use this one but it's it basically

585
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,440
just dumps out passwords from chrome or

586
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,260
cookies or any if any any useful data

587
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,640
that

588
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,400
uh in Chrome so

589
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,679
they'll usually basically take just dump

590
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:00,780
all the passwords from chrome and then

591
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,740
they'll

592
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,360
send that into another tool that they

593
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,120
call is called invoke SMB Auto root this

594
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,159
is going to be a tool I'll get to

595
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,440
here in a second uh

596
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,419
so some other Powershell tools they use

597
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:15,059
there's power view which mostly what

598
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:16,500
they used it for in there at least when

599
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,539
I saw it referenced was using invoke

600
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:20,580
sharefinder this kind of helps them with

601
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,740
enumerating the network the network sure

602
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,840
find booksharefinder in particular helps

603
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,120
them find shares on the network as you

604
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,679
would probably guess and authenticate to

605
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:29,400
them

606
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,039
so another tool they use the curb

607
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:34,200
roasting so as we were talking about I

608
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,400
think uh

609
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,200
some there was a talk about that earlier

610
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,480
but kerberosing is going to allow them

611
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,740
basically to dump hashes from the

612
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,539
network so

613
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:44,820
um and then invoke SMB Auto yeah so

614
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,340
they've sent him to rely heavily on

615
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:50,340
using SMB Auto Brew because they'll

616
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,559
basically take their list of users they

617
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,419
want to try to brute force and then

618
00:22:54,419 --> 00:22:55,799
they'll run them against this Powershell

619
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:57,780
script and it'll kind of

620
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,360
find some some passwords so and another

621
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,059
tool they use is power up SQL which is

622
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:04,980
basically a tool to exploit SQL servers

623
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,840
which as you can imagine it's probably

624
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,280
where a company keeps all their useful

625
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,960
data so it's probably good for them to

626
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,000
steal it all

627
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,280
uh so for Powershell this is kind of an

628
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,260
example this is this is from my Google

629
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,400
doc

630
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,000
um and it for the invoke SMB Auto Group

631
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,400
section and basically they're just kind

632
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,039
of they're kind of Step by Step guiding

633
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:28,860
how to use this Powershell script

634
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,140
um to basically brute force all the

635
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,940
users the the domain admins on the

636
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,440
network they'll basically make a list of

637
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,600
the domain admins they want to get into

638
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,919
and then they'll make a list of

639
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,720
passwords that they can use and then

640
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,340
they'll basically brute force them until

641
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,380
they get a password

642
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,080
so and yeah in this in this example they

643
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,580
scrambled to me two tomato

644
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:50,580
administrators Cisco their services and

645
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,559
administrator which they had like a

646
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,900
keyboard walk which is kind of sad so

647
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,059
and then I also just added this slide

648
00:23:57,059 --> 00:23:59,640
which I thought was interesting I I did

649
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,880
a a red team at my old job did a pen

650
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,400
test where they just like let's just try

651
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,679
password spraying so let's just try a

652
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:08,539
bunch of

653
00:24:08,539 --> 00:24:12,179
seasons and months with a year at the

654
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:13,980
end and just do it so I thought it was

655
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,120
funny that they in their own

656
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,159
documentation they they like recommend

657
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:18,539
doing the exact same thing that red

658
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:19,980
teams do is just

659
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,200
try them try a month and year and see

660
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,840
what you get so and I think when we did

661
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,679
it at my old job we got one user to

662
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:30,360
successfully authenticate sometimes

663
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,440
that's all they need to start getting

664
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,340
into the network and pivoting so

665
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:38,640
yeah so kerberosting they so rubius

666
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,320
Kerberos thing this stuff they use it

667
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,539
basically to to work through the network

668
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:44,760
so they'll basically

669
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,299
so it's a tool basically to get to

670
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:50,220
interact with kuros which for people

671
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,659
that aren't familiar with is like the

672
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:54,840
windows Authentication Protocol so they

673
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,640
can use this to basically

674
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,100
steel patches for for users and then

675
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,659
crack them later they'll usually take

676
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:02,159
these offline they'll take the hashes

677
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,340
export them and then crack them on their

678
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,620
offline Network in hashcat which is a

679
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:10,200
password cracking tool so

680
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,059
uh you should still look for hashcad on

681
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:13,380
hosts but I don't think you'd actually

682
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,059
see it but what you'll see is

683
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:17,940
kerberosting so what with curb roasting

684
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,320
you usually see a ton of network

685
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,840
connections from a box and it's also

686
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,260
like

687
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,640
like a lot of

688
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,440
active directory network connections and

689
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,779
stuff like that and again we have a

690
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,400
pretty we had a recent blog where we

691
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,140
actually talked about career hosting and

692
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,820
they they had it with like the creator

693
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:39,480
of rubius so it was pretty cool

694
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,520
um and here's from their guide on how to

695
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,559
use kerberost so they're just rubius

696
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:46,679
curb roast and it and it and they output

697
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:49,440
the command output the results into a

698
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,120
text file right in the program data

699
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,919
folder another that was another one I

700
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:54,840
kind of noticed was like you see a lot

701
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,100
of text files being written the program

702
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,960
data to the root of program data that's

703
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,220
pretty weird because generally program

704
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,260
data is just a bunch of folders

705
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,659
so you see any files in program data

706
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:05,520
that's kind of a red flag

707
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,880
um and then from and then they basically

708
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,159
take that and then the rest of this is

709
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:12,840
basically them trying to

710
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,419
run run rubius to basically get hashes

711
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:18,240
in different ways uh and then Brute

712
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,380
Force

713
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:22,260
some passwords and stuff to authenticate

714
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,679
yep

715
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,760
yeah and then next tool they use is

716
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,039
called ad find

717
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:31,020
when I've seen cubot like start running

718
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,279
out of boxes like one of the first

719
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:34,980
things they drop it's basically a tool

720
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,480
that lets you enumerate a network it's a

721
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,360
totally legit administrative tool and it

722
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,980
basically lets them

723
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,260
output everything so they have like a

724
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,840
script this is from a defer report that

725
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,520
top right one is from the defer report

726
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,919
and it basically out is a script to run

727
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,960
all the ad find

728
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,539
options to get all the users all the

729
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:56,880
computers the OU's everything they could

730
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,500
possibly get from the domain and then

731
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,299
they dump it to one file again and they

732
00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:02,820
look through it offline so it's probably

733
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,260
one of the first things

734
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,360
yeah or it's it's usually renamed so

735
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,760
again like with um

736
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,559
Tor and stuff you can kind of look for

737
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,659
like command lines that are only going

738
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:15,179
to be happening from any from ad find so

739
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:18,299
like looking for ad info from something

740
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:20,279
that's not it's probably a good place to

741
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:22,200
look so

742
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,880
yeah and then again here's some more

743
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,740
stuff from ad find in the in their

744
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:28,080
documentation basically it's that 80

745
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,100
fine script 80 F that script but in text

746
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,100
format and so basically it's just a list

747
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,960
of commands to run with ad5 to get all

748
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,360
the data they want

749
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,159
yep uh

750
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:42,720
yeah and then they also kind of like

751
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,340
show how to Pivot through this data and

752
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,480
look through things that they want to

753
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,919
find so like they need to find an

754
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:48,720
administrator they look through like the

755
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,000
user's titles and look for the director

756
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,279
of information security or some good

757
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:58,080
Target for them to to go to go after

758
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,299
so the next next tool they use is called

759
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:02,820
seat belt so if that was appropriate to

760
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,740
use Miss Frizzle

761
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,720
um it's a project that basically uh

762
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,059
perform a number of security oriented

763
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:12,480
host safety checks and also does a lot

764
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,820
of like individual host Recons so it's

765
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,520
pretty useful from from both from both a

766
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,140
informational perspective and an

767
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,880
exploitative perspective

768
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,820
it runs tons of Recon commands and like

769
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,200
looks for different kind of

770
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,779
misconfigurations on a host that they

771
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:29,220
could use to escalate their privileges

772
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,200
so again here's the command line from

773
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,480
that one and again you can see they

774
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,279
output the results straight to program

775
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,380
data so it's another

776
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,600
interesting data point like I started

777
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,039
noticing they would output everything to

778
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,620
program data as a as a text file to to

779
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:46,440
excel later to look through

780
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,659
the next tool they use is called net gpp

781
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:50,820
password so this is actually a

782
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:53,760
Powershell script in their documentation

783
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,460
they actually use it as a compiled uh

784
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,900
binary but it's it'll be the same

785
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,480
command lines and it basically

786
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,520
look for passwords stored in group

787
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,919
policy preferences so in like an older

788
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:06,419
salmon days

789
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:08,760
people would put the user account and

790
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,799
password in in certain things and that

791
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:11,940
would be stored in active directory

792
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,340
sometimes so they'll use that to their

793
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,900
advantage and find that username and

794
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,039
password which is probably going to be

795
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,480
an administrator

796
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,640
for a net for the network or at least a

797
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,380
valid user across the whole network and

798
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,000
it won't raise any suspicions if it's

799
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,700
seen logging onto things

800
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:30,419
so yeah there it's yeah so it's

801
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:32,279
it's originally part of powersploit but

802
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:36,419
they're just using it by itself so

803
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:38,159
the next tool they use is sharp view

804
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,500
this is basically a compiled

805
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,620
uh c-sharp compiled version of uh Power

806
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:47,039
view so again it helps them find in this

807
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,419
case they're using it to find a domain

808
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:49,919
user location so they'll run it when

809
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,960
they have their target user they'll run

810
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,860
it to look for what computers that admin

811
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:59,279
is logging into and they'll find

812
00:29:59,279 --> 00:29:59,820
um

813
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:00,899
yeah

814
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:03,720
they'll you I'll go back yeah

815
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,059
so the next tool they use is called is

816
00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:09,299
is a tool that actually exploits a CBE

817
00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:12,600
this is I think the only CV I noticed in

818
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,919
this set of documentation which is

819
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,200
another thing I thought was interesting

820
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,340
um

821
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:20,940
so it exploits the CV the CVS 2020 1472

822
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:24,240
and I can't tell exactly when this

823
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,919
documentation was like

824
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,340
made but uh I think from the password we

825
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,620
saw 2020 so I assume that this stuff

826
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,299
kind of was around that same time so

827
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:34,799
this is probably a pretty useful exploit

828
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,000
for them

829
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,620
um and it was just stayed up on their

830
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,779
forum for a couple years I guess but

831
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:42,480
basically it's a tool to exploit a

832
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,919
command against domain controller it

833
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,120
allows them to get remote privilege

834
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,419
escalation or remote privilege remote

835
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:50,399
code execution on a domain controller so

836
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:51,840
it's pretty handy for them because it

837
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,980
probably gives them

838
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,659
straight axis that domain controller

839
00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:56,299
pretty quickly

840
00:30:56,299 --> 00:30:58,679
yeah and then I think crowdstrike had a

841
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:00,419
pretty good blog about the zero login

842
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:01,679
vulnerability I don't think I found

843
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,080
anything about their tool

844
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,899
um specifically but they they cut it's a

845
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:09,720
0.exe a tool of our design I I mean I

846
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,980
doubt that I don't think they're that

847
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:13,679
good but uh they have some command lines

848
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,059
they run with it

849
00:31:15,059 --> 00:31:16,679
um the runner that gets the domain

850
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:19,140
controller give it a command to run

851
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:22,559
um and some other stuff to basically

852
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,120
to do whatever they want with against

853
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,500
that domain controller so it's a pretty

854
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,179
handy tool and I I don't know how often

855
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:28,559
it would work for them I'm gonna guess

856
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:29,880
enough to where they had good

857
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,279
documentation on it so

858
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:35,880
uh Patcher stuff for that at least yeah

859
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,340
so these are some sneaky I I'm kind of a

860
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:41,039
Windows registry nerd I did a I think I

861
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:41,940
did a

862
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,520
a talk at besides Springfield a couple

863
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,380
years ago where I talked about once one

864
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,700
of my first ones it was about uh

865
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,559
registry Explorer so I'm always kind of

866
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:50,700
a registeringer but these are some

867
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,620
interesting ones that they used

868
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:55,020
specifically one of them is in this a

869
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,059
lot of their scripts they create a user

870
00:31:57,059 --> 00:31:58,919
named old administrator and they add it

871
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:00,539
to this special accounts user list and

872
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:01,679
I'm like I don't know what that is I

873
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,840
like Google it and the first thing that

874
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,460
came up was like a forum post like one

875
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,080
of those Microsoft and Sephora posts

876
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,720
like how do I how do I

877
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,940
how do I prevent the the a user from

878
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,620
like appearing at the login screen I'm

879
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,299
like oh that makes sense why they use it

880
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:16,440
because they because they want to move

881
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,940
through the network without being seen

882
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:20,460
so it's a pretty handy option and the

883
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,720
other thing they do is I didn't even I

884
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,880
guess I didn't think about this but uh

885
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,500
apparently you can change the default

886
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,659
RDP Port which is probably good from a

887
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:29,340
Securities perspective if you're trying

888
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:32,100
to secure something that might be you

889
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,840
don't want somebody remote into but

890
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,159
they're using it in the other sense

891
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:36,840
obviously they're trying to hide from

892
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,059
Network traffic going in or out to blend

893
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:41,220
in with something else in their case I

894
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,740
think they changed it to 1350.

895
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:47,100
uh and so here's that script uh yeah so

896
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,600
in this case they're running any disk

897
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,460
and they're creating it they're sending

898
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,620
a password for this anti-disc instance

899
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,960
and they're creating a user they're

900
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,120
adding it to this special list and then

901
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,220
they're also in this case this is their

902
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:02,520
command to basically redirect RDP RDP

903
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,480
traffic

904
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,419
to a New Port allow it a new firewall

905
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:09,360
rule for it and and go so

906
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,460
and restart terminal services to you

907
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,860
know make it work so the next one of the

908
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,059
other things they do I thought was kind

909
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:17,340
of funny was they so this is kind of

910
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,019
their their General path for privilege

911
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:20,940
escalation here is they find the admin

912
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:24,720
with ad find they use sharp view uh to

913
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,159
find the workstation that that admin

914
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,000
uses and the remote in using SMB shares

915
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,620
and pass the hash to that workstation to

916
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,840
left and a key to it at least to log in

917
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,600
and then they'll start looking through

918
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,640
that administrator's workstation for

919
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,740
password stores uh they'll also look for

920
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,440
just text files in the desktop say

921
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,419
password.xls or

922
00:33:44,419 --> 00:33:47,399
access.xls or whatever so they're big

923
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:49,620
brain thinking here I guess

924
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:52,140
so here in this example they're they're

925
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,720
examining different directories the ones

926
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,519
that they looked for were like look in

927
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:58,260
the desktop the downloads make sure it's

928
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,720
an admin these are like this looks like

929
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,820
an admins workstation and if it is yep

930
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,919
all right so let's go to these folders

931
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:06,539
in this case

932
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:08,520
uh again I mentioned the app data folder

933
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,639
before it has like local has

934
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:12,599
um

935
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:14,760
usually local is

936
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,859
like programs that don't have effect

937
00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:18,899
like aren't like installed on the

938
00:34:18,899 --> 00:34:20,040
computer sometimes you'll have stuff

939
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:20,940
there

940
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,619
uh app data roaming is kind of where

941
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:24,239
like generally programs store like

942
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,619
configurations and stuff so that's

943
00:34:25,619 --> 00:34:27,418
that's again handy for them because they

944
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:29,219
might want to look for like FTP

945
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:30,780
credentials stored in a config or

946
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,918
something like that

947
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:34,918
and then of course in app data local in

948
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:36,899
Chrome they look they go straight to the

949
00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:38,280
Google Chrome folder and that's where

950
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,199
they get again passwords that they can

951
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:42,000
dump out and they'll dump the Chrome

952
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,339
history and cookies and stuff like that

953
00:34:44,339 --> 00:34:45,800
and then of course they'll look for

954
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,540
LastPass key pass different folder

955
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,800
different stuff that related to

956
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,119
credentials because they need to get

957
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,219
there they needed to get all their all

958
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:54,540
the access they can get because they

959
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,639
don't just need domain admin they have

960
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,500
to have privileges for the veeam serve

961
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:01,320
the server for backups like veeam or

962
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:04,200
Synology or they have to get access to

963
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,060
any sxi servers that's not necessarily

964
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,680
domain connected so they have to find

965
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,660
everything because they gotta they have

966
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:12,060
to wipe out that Network very

967
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,619
efficiently so they have to find all the

968
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:16,700
credentials that they can get to

969
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,420
um yeah and then another thing they'll

970
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,800
do is they'll they'll grab the Outlook

971
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,839
full they'll go into the Outlook folder

972
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,359
in app data local and they'll grab the

973
00:35:24,359 --> 00:35:27,000
OST file so people aren't familiar with

974
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,339
when you open up Outlook it like loads

975
00:35:29,339 --> 00:35:30,599
for a little while for the first time

976
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:32,400
but after that it just kind of like

977
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,660
loads immediately and you have your

978
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,579
email but like when you reopen your

979
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:37,680
outlook it kind of takes a moment and

980
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,720
then new emails start popping in at the

981
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,060
beginning of the day that's because the

982
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,619
emails are actually cached on that

983
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:46,440
computer when you first log in so that

984
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,240
so they take advantage of that take that

985
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,400
that cash set of emails

986
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,160
and take that for themselves and look

987
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,720
through that because a lot of times I

988
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,160
mean how many times have any has anybody

989
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,280
here been sent a password a username and

990
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,420
password and email

991
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,040
and they're told to immediately change

992
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,599
that maybe they don't enforce that

993
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,220
whatever so it's a good place it's a

994
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,920
good Treasure Trove of sensitive data

995
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,440
like passwords they also of course

996
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,320
looking for like your

997
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,260
um your policy up your insurance policy

998
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,000
for cyber Insurance because they're

999
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,740
going to charge you as much as they can

1000
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,420
they're going to find that limit that

1001
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,160
the insurer provide that the insurer

1002
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,599
will pay out to and then they'll just

1003
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,099
try to do exactly that much how

1004
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:28,680
convenient so

1005
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,440
so one of the LA one of the near nearly

1006
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,700
the last thing they'll do before they

1007
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,619
start encrypting things is they'll dump

1008
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:37,619
ntds which if people aren't familiar

1009
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:39,720
with ntds it's basically

1010
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,480
the entire active directory usernames

1011
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,240
passwords all it's the entire domain

1012
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:49,079
controllers like files so the one the

1013
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:51,119
thing they'll use usually is ntdsutil

1014
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,980
and they kind of talk about running that

1015
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,380
and getting the ntds dip file

1016
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,660
but they say sometimes you get kicked

1017
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,640
out for this so they're like here's the

1018
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,440
sneakier way to do it the thing that

1019
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,599
they do here is they'll turn on

1020
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:06,320
they'll basically enable

1021
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,900
volume Shadows those enable the volume

1022
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,760
Shadow service which is basically on

1023
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,760
Windows like your backups for a file

1024
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,380
when you delete it or when you change it

1025
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:18,240
you can revert that file so like what

1026
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,980
they'll do is they'll turn it on on the

1027
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:22,200
domain controller and they'll take us a

1028
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,540
volume Shadow snapshot they'll and then

1029
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:27,000
they'll copy out that that

1030
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,700
into the ntds dip file from that instead

1031
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,320
of running in tedious util which will

1032
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,020
probably raise some stock red flags

1033
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,240
oh so and then

1034
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,400
um they'll usually X fill this file

1035
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,020
um they'll they'll take it sometimes

1036
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,220
they'll just copy it straight from that

1037
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,900
box because they they usually have like

1038
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,180
a file share open to that box to remote

1039
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,619
in and pull files that they want like

1040
00:37:46,619 --> 00:37:48,599
they were with the um

1041
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,099
with the that administrator's

1042
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:51,119
workstation

1043
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,200
so

1044
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,119
if you see this file leave your network

1045
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:55,980
or you see this file just be zipped up

1046
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,180
and

1047
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,619
stuff's done with it you don't know if

1048
00:37:58,619 --> 00:38:00,119
it's taken out if you don't know if it's

1049
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:02,760
been taken but you think it has you need

1050
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,500
to reset your

1051
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,320
domain controllers KR your Kerberos

1052
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,180
ticket

1053
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:11,099
krb TGT you can do this in the admiss

1054
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:14,040
The Domain controllers

1055
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,680
um admin panel and you need to reset it

1056
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,599
twice or even three times I guess for

1057
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:21,660
cloud instances but if you're if you

1058
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,579
don't if you only reset it once it

1059
00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:25,440
basically allows all the computers on

1060
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,720
the network to keep working for a little

1061
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:31,020
bit longer so if you don't reset it

1062
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:33,900
twice it maintains that backup so if you

1063
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,579
as long if you basically have to break

1064
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:37,140
that connection immediately otherwise

1065
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:39,000
they're gonna know something's about to

1066
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,700
happen and they need to basically

1067
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,599
re-escalate Privileges and it basically

1068
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:44,940
gives them a way back in uh when you're

1069
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,619
trying to kick them out

1070
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:48,180
so

1071
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,400
so here from there again this is from

1072
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,020
their documentation

1073
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,480
this is kind of them

1074
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,380
um

1075
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:58,260
creating a vault creating a a volume

1076
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,300
Shadow against the domain controller or

1077
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,740
like looking for it if it's not there

1078
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,720
make it

1079
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,640
um and then how to look through the

1080
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,500
volume Shadow how to find that volume

1081
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:11,820
shadow that they just created and then

1082
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,940
um basically the direct export that file

1083
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:17,040
from the from the volume Shadow folder

1084
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,079
which is kind of like this weird

1085
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:21,240
slash Global root thing you'll see it

1086
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,680
kind of at the bottom there it's kind of

1087
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,240
a very weird syntax you have to figure

1088
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,099
it out from like the terminal command

1089
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:26,880
line

1090
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,460
and they'll do this remotely or I've

1091
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,560
seen it happen against another network

1092
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,599
uh local on that domain controller

1093
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:34,980
they'll just run they'll just run volume

1094
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:37,680
shadows and start looking for that

1095
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,079
entity that volume shadow

1096
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,200
disk drive thing and they'll find it and

1097
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,540
then they'll get the entitious dip file

1098
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,980
this is pretty sneaky because I don't

1099
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,720
think I've seen I didn't I never thought

1100
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,280
about this until I was looking through

1101
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,320
this data and then like I made a rule a

1102
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,240
detection rule to find it and it like

1103
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,280
triggered on somebody which was kind of

1104
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,560
sad or it was kind of awesome too for me

1105
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,880
but

1106
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,260
another tool that use is called

1107
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,780
filezilla and I'm familiar with

1108
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,700
filezilla because it like is always

1109
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,260
loaded with adware which is really

1110
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:10,079
annoying but um it's kind of a tool to

1111
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:12,780
basically remote into file shares

1112
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:16,020
um so it's usually meant for like FTP

1113
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:18,300
and some other stuff they'll use it for

1114
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,400
on their remote workstation that's

1115
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,140
usually authenticated to the network but

1116
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,940
not out of the domain

1117
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:26,339
and they'll basically use file filezilla

1118
00:40:26,339 --> 00:40:27,900
to remote into other workstations and

1119
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,460
look through files it kind of reminded

1120
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,560
me of when I was when I worked at a sock

1121
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:34,320
if I got alert on a workstation I'm just

1122
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,599
pulling up the run run prompt and just

1123
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:39,480
doing slash slash hostname slash C

1124
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,099
dollar they're kind of doing the same

1125
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:43,619
thing again they're just remoting in

1126
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:45,480
to look through that person's computer

1127
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,520
and look through the files and it's very

1128
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,800
difficult to detect this so there's not

1129
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,440
really a way to detect filezilla

1130
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,599
to me because like everybody uses it but

1131
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:55,859
like

1132
00:40:55,859 --> 00:40:57,540
and see being used remotely so all

1133
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:01,279
you're seeing is like file access events

1134
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,180
um next tool they use is called our

1135
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,339
clone it's um it's another system

1136
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:07,320
administrator tool

1137
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,300
um it's it's actually I think you get

1138
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,180
this name from another tool called rsync

1139
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,680
um and it basically makes it easy to

1140
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,380
copy data to make backups was what rsync

1141
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,240
was our clones basically the same thing

1142
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,420
it's just a more commercial it's free I

1143
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,460
think but there's a website for it and

1144
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:24,480
stuff

1145
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,079
um

1146
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:27,300
again they had a good we have I don't

1147
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,680
want to talk about like the how to

1148
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,119
exactly how to look for it because they

1149
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:31,920
have there's a very lengthy blog on that

1150
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,280
one too but basically uh they'll use our

1151
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,160
clone with like Mega and some other uh

1152
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,020
file sharing utilities and you can look

1153
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:43,200
for like a config file again like like

1154
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,880
tour

1155
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,320
um and some other options that are

1156
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,240
specific to like the transfer sizes and

1157
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,560
stuff like that so there's some good

1158
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,540
command lines there

1159
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,400
actually oh yeah there's some stuff here

1160
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,720
yeah

1161
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,960
um like in this example at the top right

1162
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,579
CEO studyac which is our clone again in

1163
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:01,380
this case they're copying a file so you

1164
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:03,359
with our clone you give it a command a

1165
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:04,859
copy a sync

1166
00:42:04,859 --> 00:42:07,560
a backup and some other stuff or some

1167
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,820
other things and then you give it some

1168
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:11,160
options a path to back up and a

1169
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:14,700
destination with some Flags

1170
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,859
uh another tool they use again this is

1171
00:42:16,859 --> 00:42:18,839
the decrypt veeam passwords so again

1172
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:20,579
they'll

1173
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:22,140
um for veeam it's a tool to basically

1174
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,820
back up virtual machines again they're

1175
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:25,320
looking for everything they can access

1176
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,060
because if they don't

1177
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:29,160
encrypt everything that you may not pay

1178
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:32,520
the ransom so this tool basically they

1179
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,099
had a net script

1180
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:37,140
yeah a.net script that they would

1181
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,660
compile on that the veeam server and

1182
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:42,900
they would basically dump the entire SQL

1183
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,280
they would use an SQL command to

1184
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,599
basically dump

1185
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:47,700
all the all the information they need

1186
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:50,040
for that tool and they can pile it on

1187
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,359
the box and they'd run it and it would

1188
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:53,099
dump all the veeam passwords out so that

1189
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:57,240
they could authenticate to it and

1190
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,260
um

1191
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:01,260
encrypt things yeah

1192
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:02,760
so next thing they'll find one of the

1193
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,079
last things they'll do is they'll stop

1194
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:06,720
all the processes so that seems kind of

1195
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,760
weird why would you be like showing your

1196
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:09,900
hand like that it's because they're

1197
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,700
about to encrypt everything

1198
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,040
so if you're not familiar with like how

1199
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,619
like Windows works if you have a program

1200
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:19,740
Open like Windward you can't you can't

1201
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:21,300
do anything with that word document you

1202
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,460
can't encrypt it so they have to stop

1203
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:25,680
all the processes so that they can

1204
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,839
encrypt all those those useful files to

1205
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:29,220
them

1206
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:32,700
um so this this list was like massive it

1207
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,099
was like five or six it was like like

1208
00:43:35,099 --> 00:43:36,960
three or four pages of like

1209
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,819
stop this stop this stop this everything

1210
00:43:38,819 --> 00:43:40,619
it was just over and over again just how

1211
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:42,300
to stop different services in a big

1212
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:43,260
giant list

1213
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:44,940
so

1214
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:47,220
so like can summary some of the things

1215
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:48,180
that

1216
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:50,220
um I kind of started to take away from

1217
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:51,720
this I was looking at it read the manual

1218
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,640
on these things because it gives you a

1219
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:56,160
lot of contextual information

1220
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,800
um read the manual on our clone read the

1221
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,940
manual on

1222
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:02,160
um tour and you start to recognize

1223
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,319
command lines when you get an alert and

1224
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:05,460
you're like I don't know what this is

1225
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:09,720
like you it helps to like give you

1226
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:12,000
context when you're looking at alerts so

1227
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,040
it's pretty odd it's pretty it's pretty

1228
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:14,640
um

1229
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,319
awesome whenever you start you'll start

1230
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:17,520
to learn things

1231
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,859
and you'll when you just see something

1232
00:44:19,859 --> 00:44:22,380
going across your your Splunk data or

1233
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:24,180
whatever Sim you're in you might it

1234
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:25,560
might start to trigger something or

1235
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:28,020
trigger some memories on something

1236
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:32,339
so Conti is not really gone I guess so

1237
00:44:32,339 --> 00:44:35,040
like again they disband but they're the

1238
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,780
tools are everywhere these these

1239
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,520
techniques are they just basically rinse

1240
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:41,099
and Pete I think that one of those

1241
00:44:41,099 --> 00:44:42,839
screenshots was from uh like there's

1242
00:44:42,839 --> 00:44:45,000
like a thing called like white stork and

1243
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,500
they basically use a rename copy a tour

1244
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,839
just like these these like Conti did so

1245
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:52,200
they just take the same techniques and

1246
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,300
then just repeat them elsewhere

1247
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:57,540
um like Sans says no normal find evil so

1248
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:59,700
is it normal for you to use our clone

1249
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,579
maybe maybe not uh do you normally use

1250
00:45:02,579 --> 00:45:04,980
active directory I mean you use

1251
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:08,760
to use ad find in your network to use

1252
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:11,520
net support what remote access tools do

1253
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,540
you use

1254
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:14,579
and that's pretty handy to know when you

1255
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:16,440
start seeing alerts for any disk because

1256
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,119
you're like it doesn't happen use any

1257
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:20,160
disk I don't know so

1258
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,200
most of the tools here weren't zero days

1259
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,940
so

1260
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:26,400
I mean it's it's good to take care of

1261
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,859
and patch things but don't get hung up

1262
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:30,839
on the latest zero day because most of

1263
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:33,240
this stuff is just like

1264
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:36,119
just stuff off the shelf so don't

1265
00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:38,460
the zero days I personally I don't think

1266
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:40,200
I've seen a lot of zero days that

1267
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,460
resulted in a lot of immediate

1268
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:42,720
exploitation other than like the

1269
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,040
exchange vulnerability

1270
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,380
most stuff it comes out

1271
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:49,319
uh what was it the SMB one that was from

1272
00:45:49,319 --> 00:45:52,380
uh the the equation editor leaks or

1273
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:54,540
whatever not equation or equation group

1274
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:57,599
The SMB stuff when that came out it was

1275
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:58,800
like

1276
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,160
it was months it was like that that got

1277
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,319
released then there was a cve then it

1278
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:06,599
was like patch the patch was out in like

1279
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:08,700
a month it took like three or four

1280
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,020
months for like Wanna Cry to start

1281
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:11,339
coming around and start exploring that

1282
00:46:11,339 --> 00:46:14,040
so you have time to to patch things

1283
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,660
don't don't get hung up on the latest

1284
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:17,280
thing

1285
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,680
that's it

1286
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,279
questions

1287
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,240
dope

1288
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,660
cool

1289
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:32,280
oh yeah sorry what where

1290
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:35,240
oh yeah

1291
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:39,000
I don't I don't know I was I was like

1292
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,800
this is weird why are they

1293
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:45,319
yeah she's hot I'm sure yeah it's that

1294
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:48,740
oh she in that

1295
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,680
well that's that's a weird that's weird

1296
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,399
I never put that

1297
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:01,940
well

1298
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:06,180
maybe that's that's pretty cool

1299
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:08,660
who

1300
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:11,280
I gotta watch The Matrix again it's been

1301
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,240
so long I'm sorry yeah I'm not a real

1302
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:17,280
I'm a real hacker

1303
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,500
yes yeah that makes that that's that's a

1304
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,180
pretty funny coincidence that I I could

1305
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:23,280
see that they're just like trying to be

1306
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,859
meta with it but also keep it low-key or

1307
00:47:25,859 --> 00:47:27,660
something like that there was also like

1308
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:30,180
a lot of cool like in the in the

1309
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,560
documentation again like that's why I

1310
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,960
kind of showed how to do it was like

1311
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:34,619
um

1312
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:36,119
there's a lot of cool stuff you could

1313
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:37,859
take away from this these text files

1314
00:47:37,859 --> 00:47:40,140
that you can you can find in this public

1315
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:42,780
repo and it was like there was a lot of

1316
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:44,460
different resources for for their pen

1317
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:46,560
testing there was like guides on how to

1318
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,900
disable Windows Defender it's there's a

1319
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,160
lot of cool stuff in here and it was

1320
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,980
hard to like fit stuff into slides very

1321
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:54,060
easily because there was a lot of text

1322
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:55,920
but it was a very easy read for me

1323
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,599
because it was just like

1324
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:59,040
just you just kind of skim through it

1325
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,040
and find the stuff that's cool so

1326
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,540
yep

1327
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:05,520
yeah

1328
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,119
so
