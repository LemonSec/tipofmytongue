put it out an email through there is a

108
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:16,800
hump and then last but not not last but

109
00:07:13,289 --> 00:07:18,300
so a closing announcement it's probably

110
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,289
something a few people in the room don't

111
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:24,289
want to see but we're gonna do it anyway

112
00:07:21,289 --> 00:07:24,289
so

113
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,020
I'm just gonna let it right read that

114
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:57,490
sorry so basically what that says is

115
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:59,650
part of the journey is the end well for

116
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:03,220
me for as an organizer anyway so I'm

117
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:05,560
stepping down effective after we do all

118
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:08,770
the closing stuff and you know just kind

119
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,360
of the recap stuff it's been in awesome

120
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:14,289
four years for me to be a part of this

121
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:17,860
crew we have an awesome crew that's come

122
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:19,540
in last year and you know all this is

123
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:22,870
you know part of their hard work and

124
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:25,720
lots of coordination for a year I

125
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:27,940
wouldn't be stepping out of this role if

126
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,040
I didn't feel like they could shoulder

127
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:37,080
it and continue to make it awesome and

128
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:40,659
better and grow it so so like I said my

129
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,970

00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:59,440
back to kind of focus on me a bit and

133
00:08:49,140 --> 00:09:00,970
family and career and whatnot so it's
