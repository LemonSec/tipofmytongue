46
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:10,560
probably thinking well how do I identify

47
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:13,290
an organizer or volunteer so our crew

48
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,970
and everybody has badges

49
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:17,579

50
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:20,760

volunteers are are the red badges or as

55
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:33,540
I'm thinking about them the red shirts

56
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:34,980
Star Trek think so so look for one of

57
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,660
those folks and they'll you know they'll

58
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,369
help you out do what they can

59
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,769
if a volunteer can't help they'll find

60
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:43,379
an organizer and we'll do what we can to

61
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:49,829

talk to talk to you so you know kind of

114
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:17,610
the deal is is that for them to get the

115
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:19,200
most value out of out of the conferences

116
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:21,479
they you know connect the old-fashioned

117
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,740
way build relationships but we don't

118
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:24,630
give a list out for because we're a

119
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:29,729
security conference and nobody wants to

120
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:31,880
information given out so so we'll cover

121
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:34,890
some awesomeness that happened yesterday

122
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:37,469
with our first ever free conference

123
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:40,020
training with Chris and early data

124
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:42,810
packet analysis workshop is anybody in

125
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:47,520
the room that was there yesterday how'd

126
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:50,430
you guys like that awesome we were happy

127
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:54,539
to be able to do that so it was really

128
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:56,640
awesome to have Chris here and look you

129
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:58,380
know we didn't we're probably not gonna

130
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,760
do a feedback loop we did it we did a

131
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,680
pretty good lessons learned after that

132
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,930
yesterday I think we know what we did

133
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,900
wrong so thanks for bearing with us as

134
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:09,780
we learn learned this year

135
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,260
so hopefully we'll do that again next

136
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:13,460
year

137
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:16,340
maybe somebody else maybe more who knows

138
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:20,669
you'll notice we didn't actually put out

139
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:22,469
the schedule on paper so I wanted to

140
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:26,760
throw a few links and a couple QR codes

141
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:28,410
up on the screen so we used busy comp to

142
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:31,699
do all the scheduling and ticketing and

143
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:35,520
everything this year so the schedule is

144
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:38,699
online at at these URLs

145
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:42,270
it's very mobile friendly besides STL or

146
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:45,500
go to the speaker schedule page and you

147
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:45,500
should have have what you need

148
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:58,560
does anybody need that up there for a

149
00:06:48,000 --> 00:07:00,330
few more seconds okay moving on so

150
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,560
that's kind of the outline of the

151
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:05,789
schedule two tracks - breakdowns and one

152
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,940
of the breakout rooms will end up being

153
00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:13,080
a speaker lounge for most of the day and

154
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:16,590
we'll have a no-scent workshop in there

155
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:19,080
for about an hour so so that's kind of

156
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:21,869
how the schedule breaks out we had to

157
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:25,560
shift some things around so if you saw

158
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:27,720
the schedule before yesterday CTF and

159
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:31,590
mental health was on the third floor if

160
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:33,479
now on the lower level and the speaker

161
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:35,250
alone you know sent workshop is on on

162
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:39,240
the upper level so it just made more

163
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:41,820
sense from moving equipment room gonna

164
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,620
put sponsors back up there for a second

165
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:45,990
know this is possible without

166
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,639
sponsorship and the support from our

167
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:51,270
sponsors so I guess I'd go visit with

168
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:52,520
them and build relationships and and

169
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,919
whatnot so

170
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,989
[Music]

171
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,989
[Applause]

172
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:04,500
something I didn't put in the slide deck

173
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:06,720
I just wanted to see you real quick so

174
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:09,139
who's never been to an empathic

175
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,699
conference raise your hand

176
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:19,259

180
00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:32,219

181
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:33,419
well keep coming back hopefully we can

182
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:34,860
continue to make this better

183
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:37,978
which kind of leads into my next slide

184
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:41,180
we haven't really solicited feedback in

185
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:44,570
the past so we want your your input so

186
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:48,300
we'll throw this back up later on today

187
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:49,740
it's a Google Form and we're probably

188
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,319
going to send this out through a busy

189
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:54,060
comp messaging platform after the

190
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,600
conference so if there's things you

191
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,069
don't like

192
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,740
you know remember them write them down

193
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:00,930
or you know and then let us know about

194
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,730
it because we want to make this better

195
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:07,949
for st. Louis and surrounding regions

196
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:09,329
for years to come so and with that I'll

197
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,740
get offstage because you don't want to

198
00:09:09,329 --> 00:09:11,939
listen to me talk all day you actually

199
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,770
probably want to listen to Michael

200
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,130
Collins talk for the next hour our

201
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,130
