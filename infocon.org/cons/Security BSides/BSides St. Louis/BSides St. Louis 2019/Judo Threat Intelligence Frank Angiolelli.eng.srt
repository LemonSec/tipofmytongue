1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,510
for sale for $15 it's a lockpick village

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:07,410
we're gonna have lunch after this at

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:10,440
noon we're gonna be selling old besides

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:12,420
shirts for $5 minimum donation and that

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,759
money's gonna go to the rural tech fund

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,430
and the mental health hackers so all the

7
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:18,750
money's gonna go back to the charities

8
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:21,029
if we ask for a $5 minimum donation

9
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,130
those should go on sale roughly about

10
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:26,009
one o'clock

11
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:31,679
next up or first up for today down here

12
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:34,920
is judo threat intelligence by Frank and

13
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:41,879
Joe Lilly Lilly okay I'm sorry but

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:43,800

17
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,969
all the vowels

18
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,530
I've got like all of them you don't want

19

00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:57,449
now so so the holy wow that's not my

22
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,739
last name as you but don't think I

23
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:01,199
haven't thought about changing it

24
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:02,699
because I definitely yeah one of my

25
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,679
daughters actually has a you and her

26
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:06,570
first name so she's pretty much all

27
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,310
covered so today I'm gonna talk to you

28
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,139
about judo threat intelligence and

29
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,700
despite this incredible physique I don't

30
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,680
actually do judo I used to do karate

31
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,619
many years ago but this is far more

32
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,670
about walking through a thought process

33
00:01:15,619 --> 00:01:19,860
that I've implemented at a lot of

34
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,450
organizations it's a philosophy that

35
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,880
deals with a lot of the challenges that

36
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,500
we have in the industry and I think has

37
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,820
provided some pretty good results I hope

38
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,350
you get something out of it next slide

39
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,758
please

40
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:31,470
the deal is doing a great job backing me

41
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,119
up on the slide so thanks very much so

42
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,310
it's a little bit of background on me so

43
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,900
I've run a number of different security

44
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,939
operations centers throughout the

45
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,130
country a lot of New York financials a

46
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:42,149
lot of government organizations and as I

47
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,530
said what I'm going to talk to you about

48
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,579
today is a philosophy that I've

49
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,530
implemented it each of those

50
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:48,960
organizations and its really kind of

51
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:51,270
helped there's a lot of information that

52
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,100
comes out on the web there's a lot of

53
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,679
things that call for our attention okay

54
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,640
but like what's the most important thing

55
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,439
what's the most important thing that

56
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,700
we're supposed to do yo don't worry

57
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:02,729
about it cuz you'll see that in a

58
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,020
cybersecurity news article right oh so

59
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:08,628
wait a second so the next slide please

60
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:10,530
so when we think about intelligence I

61
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:12,769
always think about the difference

62
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:15,320
between information

63
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:16,910
and intelligence right so there are

64
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:19,670
definitely things that gives us a lot of

65
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:21,200
information but when we distill that and

66
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:23,089
digest that down into work

67
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,709
what the heck should I do now so one of

68
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:26,090
the things I like to say is that the

69
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:28,190
most important decision is what you

70
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:29,480
choose not to focus on right because

71
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:31,100
there's a thousand things calling for

72
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,630
your attention so what is that and the

73
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:35,450
difference between internal intelligence

74
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:36,829
and external intelligence so yeah

75
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:38,060
there's a lot of providers out there

76
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:40,340
that are giving you an external

77
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:42,170
intelligent you know cozy fuzzy happy

78
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,850
bear you know versus whatever panda

79
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:45,260
right we get those reports and they're

80
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:47,900
good they're valuable but what's inside

81
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:49,850
of our organization what can we use in

82
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,500
our and that's primarily what this is

83
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:53,660
going to focus on and then obviously

84
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,610
being actionable and scalable at some

85
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:59,740
level right brute force is not the

86
00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:03,560
solution next slide please

87
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:06,170
so in order to understand what are we

88
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,780
dealing with in the Security Operations

89
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:11,269
threat intelligence incident response

90
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,620
type world I want to measure this from a

91
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:14,780
couple of different angles so the chart

92
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:16,550
that you're looking at is a program that

93
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:18,740
I wrote that's downloaded every single

94
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:20,660
cyber security security news article

95
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:23,990
that's been published from 16 different

96
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:26,480
sources every day since April of 2019

97
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:29,120
I've done world word clouds on this I've

98
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,380
done classifiers on it you see how many

99
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,200
of them are malware versus

100
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:35,269
vulnerabilities and the meta of this is

101
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,760
there's between thirty and fifty eight

102
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:40,370
articles being published every day all

103
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,890
right so wait a second that's a lot of

104
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:44,210
articles and how many how much

105
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:47,480
information is in each one of those

106
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:49,820
articles about 400 words so let's do

107
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:52,010
some math and that's approximating half

108
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:53,630
a novel a day okay that's pretty cool

109
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:56,720
but what am I supposed to do with that

110
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:59,329
okay I can't even read like a novel over

111
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,670
like five weeks like for free how about

112
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:03,500
I have a novel a day right and then

113
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:05,450
underneath you'll see there's some some

114
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,400
studies there at the bottom talking

115
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:08,929
about noise in the sim world we all kind

116
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,700
of kind of know that that's out there

117
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:12,709
all right so setting the stage here this

118
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:14,690
is kind of the volume of stuff that's

119
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:16,430
being thrown at us on a regular basis

120
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:18,980
right there's more to it but this and

121
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:21,858
then this next slide please and that's

122
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:24,020
kind of clear and so as I started

123
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:25,549
building out you know larger Security

124
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,479
Operations Center I wanted to search for

125
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:28,340
a strategy

126
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,410
I really wanted something who's dealt

127
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:31,700
with this before because somebody

128
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:34,250
somewhere is dealt with this before I

129
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:36,320
can't be the first one and so I looked

130
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:38,150
at some military strategies that are out

131
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,190
there who's dealt with this some

132
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:42,859
historical context right a good example

133
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:44,480
of this is the Vikings and England right

134
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:46,850
when the Vikings invaded England they

135
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,590
could attack any single point on the

136
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:51,830
whole coast of England at any point in

137
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:54,229
time but England had to defend every

138
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:55,460
single inch of coastline for years and

139
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:58,010
they pretty much failed at it

140
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:59,539
that's the kind of idea and so a guy by

141
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,890
name of raki introduced me to cost

142
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,330
woodsy in theory which is very

143
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:04,190
interesting it's like how do you defend

144
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:06,530
that can karate we have like the iron

145
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,640
law it's like how do you defend against

146
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:09,830
this type of stuff and there are

147
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,750
similarities to personal combat tactics

148
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:13,580
right so I mean if you've ever walked

149
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:15,410
down the street and come up against a

150
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,729
aggressive person who's much larger than

151
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:18,020
you like that's definitely never

152
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:20,300
happened to me right I'm not the biggest

153
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:23,830
guy in the world you can kind of feel

154
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:26,060
where we may stand as defenders our

155
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:28,250
adversaries are very well-funded or

156
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:30,260
they're they just spend their time

157
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:32,630
developing tools and can attack us at

158
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:33,980
any point and so he came upon the story

159
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,930
of a guy and I'm going to share this

160
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:38,360
story with you next slide please who

161
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:41,900
dealt with something very very similar

162
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:43,550
to this enter dr. Joe Goro Cano so what

163
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:47,599
I really liked about the stories that I

164
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:50,120
read about him is that he was small in

165
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,740
stature to give you an idea don't quote

166
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,470
me on this but he was roughly about 5

167
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:56,600
foot 2 and 95 pounds and he was very

168
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:58,490
well-educated and he he wrestled a lot

169
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:02,060
of jujitsu this is way back in the day

170
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:03,470
and he lost he won quite a few battles

171
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,090
but when he came up against the top

172
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:08,090
school and the bigger guys he kept

173
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:10,039
losing and so what he decided to do was

174
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:11,719
to study the attacker so as I'm reading

175
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:14,570
through his journal I came upon these

176
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:17,120
quotes they basically say usually it had

177
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:19,190
been him that threw me and all of a

178
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,130
sudden I started throwing him with

179
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:24,140
increasing regularity said really delve

180
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:26,420
deep into that right it sounds like

181
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:29,750
something really worthy and he says it's

182
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:32,030
because of the results of my study on

183
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,530
how to break their posture he's a guy

184
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:35,599
this has got to be this has got to be

185
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:37,010
worth something right how did he do that

186
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,020
what was that about and so what he

187
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,969
basically figured is that if he applied

188
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,400
all of his

189
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:45,490
physical strength and his small stature

190
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,810
before he broke the opponent's posture

191
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:50,539
what he was doing was just wasting his

192
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:52,729
energy and so I see similarities across

193
00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:54,199
the cybersecurity world where you know

194
00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:56,300
we're experiencing fatigue and burnout

195
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:57,740
the number of hours that people are

196
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,419
working and just the sheer volume of

197
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:01,789
things that we have to approach it's

198
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:03,948
like that brute force that Zhu Goro is

199
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:06,500
applying prior to breaking their posture

200
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:09,020
and so what I've developed out of this

201
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,940
is how we could adopt some of those judo

202
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,840
principles into what we do and so I'm

203
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,400
going to go through some pragmatic

204
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,799
examples of what that actually looks

205
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,270
like and then I'm going to step through

206
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,620
some of the methodology that hopefully

207
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:23,120
you can take away from this and find

208
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:24,770
valuable next slide please so let's get

209
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,449
to an approximation of their posture

210
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:27,909
this isn't going to be perfect right but

211
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:30,199
I think it's a pretty good approximation

212
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:32,270
like attacking the profit Center

213
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:34,069
defending a cost center it's cool every

214
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:35,299
time we go to the budget guy they're

215
00:07:34,069 --> 00:07:37,699
like well there isn't budget for that

216
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:40,280
well okay but we're still under attack

217
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:42,190
why because it's a profit Center next

218
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:44,900
click next please just once yeah

219
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:46,909
anonymity is their armor they can come

220
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:49,400
from any IP address anywhere in the

221
00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:50,630
world with any type of attack at any

222
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,909
point in time and all they need is that

223
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:54,139
one vulnerability that feels kind of

224
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:57,680
painful next slide please

225
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:59,180
thank you right and they always have the

226
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,210
initiative so if you've ever stood up a

227
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,919
web server in the cloud and turned it on

228
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:06,460
and then looked at the logs like within

229
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:09,859
about two hours you're getting attacked

230
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:13,090
all right thanks so thought a little bit

231
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:16,849
more about this and I think that this

232
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:19,099
models a fair percentage of what I think

233
00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:22,520
is going on from a super super high

234
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:25,190
level which is that defenders we take

235
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,659
money who we convert that into time so

236
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:28,520
it could be a tool it could be a

237
00:08:26,659 --> 00:08:31,310
capability it could be labor it could be

238
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:33,949
contractors in order to effect some sort

239
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:37,969
of an action but attackers do something

240
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:40,789
different the they invest their time in

241
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:43,250
a way that lets them produce some sort

242
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:45,130
of an action in order to get money there

243
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:47,270
are different scenarios for my summer

244
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:49,160
ideologically driven I get that some are

245
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:51,020
compromised driven I get that but for

246
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,360
the vast majority of it think about bug

247
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,510
bounty the way bug bounty works anybody

248
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,720
in

249
00:08:53,510 --> 00:09:00,080
you bug bounty yeah okay so you spend

250
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:02,810
time in the hopes of getting an action

251
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,910
which will produce you money so that

252
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:07,099
kind of helps us understand I think

253
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:08,990
their posture and where hopefully we can

254
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,320
gain an upper hand in this next slide

255
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:12,260
please

256
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:14,810
so again focusing on that it's like in

257
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:16,370
that time aspect if they invest time

258
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:18,229
they want to get action and lots of

259
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:20,480
money so I want to step through some

260
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:22,490
some pragmatic examples of this where I

261
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,110
think that this works we see this in

262
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:25,730
deception technology but blue team

263
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:30,080
defenders can actually do this next

264
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:34,460
slide please so before I begin this the

265
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:37,550
three principles are use the attackers

266
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:39,500
energy against them right that's how

267
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:41,270
judo works let's a lot of you know

268
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,580
certain martial arts work is let's use

269
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:44,900
their energy against them somebody's

270
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:47,000
running headlong at you you don't

271
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:48,740
necessarily run right at them sometimes

272
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,540
just kind of step to the side if you're

273
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:52,190
lucky you put your foot out you know and

274
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:54,380
then you smile it's like a Bugs Bunny

275
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:56,780
kind of thing right use their action

276
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:59,240
against them right maximum effect with

277
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:01,010
minimum effort that brute force I've

278
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,690
seen that brute force apply to a lot of

279
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:05,150
security operation centers where people

280
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:06,350
are coming home at 9 o'clock at night I

281
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:07,790
don't know if that's the right approach

282
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:09,890
you might have to do it for a short time

283
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:11,750
but you got to get ahead of it and then

284
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:14,630
break their posture before you execute

285
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:16,460
the throw so again it's like you can

286
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:18,620
apply all your force but until you

287
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:21,290
understand where their balance is and

288
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:22,760
how to break it that's when you want to

289
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:24,319
apply your energy so let's do this

290
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,939
because this is fun we'll get into the

291
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,430
more of the technical stuff so let's

292
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:32,480
apply this to an exploit kit next slide

293
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:35,329
please all right so it's believed Oh

294
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,520
exploit kit this one came out around

295
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:38,990
March was published very interesting

296
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,480
let's look at the data let's look at the

297
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:43,760
data elements so first on the left we

298
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:46,730
see an IP address how many bad IP

299
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:49,670
addresses are there out in the web come

300
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:51,890
on it's like billions right they could

301
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:53,750
stand up anyone anytime they want

302
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:56,000
anywhere they want so wait a second that

303
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:58,220
feels like we're there strong let's look

304
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,020
at domain names so these are subdomains

305
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:02,530
but I spent about 8 months studying

306
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:05,180
every newly registered domain name and

307
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:06,889
that I could get my hands on every day

308
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:09,649
and there's about 80 to 100

309
00:11:06,889 --> 00:11:12,829
that come out everyday what am I gonna

310
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:14,989
do with that and the second they turn on

311
00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:16,628
the exploit kit is when it gets

312
00:11:14,989 --> 00:11:21,799
weaponized so they have the initiative

313
00:11:16,629 --> 00:11:23,869
but let's focus now on the URL so if you

314
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:26,779
look really closely there is a weakness

315
00:11:23,869 --> 00:11:30,290
and exploit kits and the weakness is in

316
00:11:26,779 --> 00:11:32,959
order for the adversary to make use of

317
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:38,149
it that servers got to understand the

318
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:40,069
traffic so there's something there the

319
00:11:38,149 --> 00:11:42,139
client or the victim whatever it is you

320
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:44,269
want to describe it has to send a

321
00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:46,309
request and that server has to interpret

322
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:47,779
it if it has to interpret it it means

323
00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:50,358
it's got to be interpretive all it's

324
00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:53,689
repeatable they're all constructed based

325
00:11:50,359 --> 00:11:55,579
off of a similar pattern and so the the

326
00:11:53,689 --> 00:11:58,368
whole reason why it's called a kit is

327
00:11:55,579 --> 00:12:00,019
because they take this and they copy it

328
00:11:58,369 --> 00:12:02,149
hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of

329
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:06,609
domains so they wrote it once they read

330
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:09,079
it many click next once please however

331
00:12:06,609 --> 00:12:12,919
if we write a regex that matches that

332
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:14,748
exact pattern which this regex does and

333
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:16,220
you test that through your environment

334
00:12:14,749 --> 00:12:19,989
the only thing you have are true

335
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:24,709
positives you just broke the exploit kit

336
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:26,959
that's exactly what this is about if a

337
00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:29,268
get request or a post request goes

338
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:32,540
through your proxy servers or your URL

339
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:36,499
traffic that matches this regex pattern

340
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:39,618
it's only the exploit kit so if they

341
00:12:36,499 --> 00:12:42,249
take that exploit kit and they copy it

342
00:12:39,619 --> 00:12:46,279
to a hundred thousand IP addresses

343
00:12:42,249 --> 00:12:48,649
doesn't matter and they could register a

344
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:52,059
hundred thousand diamonds it doesn't

345
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:55,910
matter the code running on the server

346
00:12:52,059 --> 00:12:57,860
produces this URL pattern and if you

347
00:12:55,910 --> 00:13:00,500
block that

348
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:02,930
you've destroyed the exploit kit at that

349
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,850
point in time all that the money and

350
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:07,880
time and investment that they spent to

351
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:11,390
create that exploit kit you just wrecked

352
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:14,510
it so I've done this a black hole 2.0

353
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:15,529
2.1 nuclear Scavo several others you

354
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:18,529
know you can check them out I wrote the

355
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:22,040
signatures from years ago this works

356
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:24,290
and so if how many exploit kits are

357
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:27,110
there anybody want to take a guess

358
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:28,579
couple dozen ten who knows how many

359
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:29,899
exploit kits are there not that many

360
00:13:28,579 --> 00:13:31,040
there certainly aren't hundreds of

361
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:33,170
thousands and there's definitely not

362
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,519
billions so if you can reverse them you

363
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:38,180
can block them you've just taken a whole

364
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:39,709
class in Category out of your way now

365
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:41,420
you'll notice in this discussion I

366
00:13:39,709 --> 00:13:42,680
haven't mentioned one thing I haven't

367
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:48,019
mentioned what malware was being

368
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:50,689
delivered why because if you can block

369
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:53,269
the get request for the binary I don't

370
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:55,790
really care what the malware is because

371
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:57,140
you're not gonna get it yes you now a

372
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:58,819
research is really important

373
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:00,290
yes doing that kind of stuff is really

374
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:02,630
important than staying ahead of it's

375
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:04,279
really important but you can't deliver a

376
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:06,320
malware binary if you're using this next

377
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:09,910
slide please so here's a demonstration

378
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:13,700
now from a couple of days later another

379
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:15,649
domain came up with this exploit kit to

380
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:18,579
poit you'll see the domain name has

381
00:14:15,649 --> 00:14:21,579
changed but the pattern still matches

382
00:14:18,579 --> 00:14:21,579
right

383
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:27,060
so that's how you can break a hole

384
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:29,439
exploit kit next slide please

385
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:31,510
it's way easier than going after the

386
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,510
domains and so the whole concept is like

387
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:38,380
what you exactly want to do is to

388
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:40,410
destroy their developer's value you

389
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:43,750
develop an exploit kit you deploy it out

390
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:45,189
we block it they can't copy it anywhere

391
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,930
else they can't sell it anywhere else

392
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:48,580
I'm gonna sell you the spec Havel

393
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:51,699
exploit kit well dude I don't want that

394
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:54,760
man that's already been broken and then

395
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:56,410
you break their money kind of the

396
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,939
concept of where this is going and I've

397
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:59,490
applied this at a couple orgs so let's

398
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:04,690
keep going

399
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:07,450
so it's apply this to web traffic all

400
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:09,730
right going through web traffic you can

401
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:11,170
find anomalies bumps you don't have to

402
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:13,840
use machine learning for this it does

403
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:15,370
help it's nice if you got it but if you

404
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,250
don't have it you could do a lot of

405
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:20,500
other stuff you do statistical analysis

406
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:22,180
I did a talk called wrexham noise it's

407
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,530
got some good information on how to do

408
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:25,089
that if you don't have these tools and

409
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:27,160
you'll see here there's a big old spike

410
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:28,510
in the traffic this is traffic over time

411
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:31,300
I'm sorry it's cutting off a little on

412
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:34,000
the screen guys but you'll see a spike

413
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:35,740
in the traffic here so let's dig into

414
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,290
that spike let's find out what's going

415
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:39,820
on next slide please

416
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:41,380
so what's really interesting about all

417
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:44,650
that's really hard to read is that hard

418
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:46,600
to read oh man okay all right so I'll

419
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:49,140
describe it to you and it'll be just as

420
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:52,180
good I promise

421
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:54,189
so what you're looking at is an

422
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:55,890
aggregation of the user agents during

423
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:59,050
that time frame

424
00:15:55,890 --> 00:16:00,520
yeah no idea if it was user agents I

425
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:02,079
just picked a field let's look at the

426
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:04,810
URLs let's look at the user agents I

427
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:07,030
know that sounds pretty good right right

428
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:10,719
in the middle of all of this is Firefox

429
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:12,069
version 1.5 so yeah okay I'm getting

430
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,470
some laughs yeah absolutely

431
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:15,880
so like up here is like good Firefox

432
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:19,360
versions at normal and then all of a

433
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:22,900
sudden firefox one there is no reason on

434
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:27,520
planet earth firefox 1.5 should be

435
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:30,780
touching my infrastructure oh yeah dude

436
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,780
Adrian you're the best man

437
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:37,490
thank you very much appreciate it so

438
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:39,320
what you can see here now you can

439
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:42,170
actually see it is these are Firefox

440
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:44,630
versions and there's 1.5 in there this

441
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:46,939
is a reason why it's firefox 1.5 because

442
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:49,850
this is a tool and that tool was written

443
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:52,580
by folks around the time of firefox 1.5

444
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:53,870
and people just copied in it and

445
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:55,640
downloaded it and deployed it to

446
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:57,890
hundreds of thousands of IPs and just

447
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:02,020
started hitting our infrastructure BAM I

448
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:02,020
can see them next slide please

449
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:10,819
so let me give you another good example

450
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:13,520
of this this is the black spider tool

451
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:15,589
okay you see this with Olli txt if

452
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,240
you're dealing with needs alerts on your

453
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:19,369
web infrastructure you may have seen

454
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,900
this one and so there's a really good

455
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:22,489
snort signature out there I think it's

456
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,600
very valuable it's very important it

457
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:26,420
alarms you when there's a get request

458
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:29,870
for Olli txt basically this is an

459
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:32,180
attempted exploit and if the exploits

460
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:33,739
successful Ali dot txt gets uploaded to

461
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:36,580
your servers if you look at your web

462
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:38,810
traffic you'll probably see this

463
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:42,470
downloading all the traffic that these

464
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:44,690
guys were doing Holly dot txt was the

465
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:46,850
last request all right so let's think

466
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:48,050
about this in the time sequence one of

467
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:50,810
the other after the other after the

468
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:53,000
other we're getting a needs alert on the

469
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:55,909
last request of the tool okay so what's

470
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,660
the first request of the tool what does

471
00:17:55,910 --> 00:18:01,370
it start with when we mapped it out it

472
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:03,170
turned out that every single one of them

473
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:04,820
sent the same sequence of events and

474
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:07,760
precisely the same order because it's a

475
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:10,399
tool somebody wrote a tool and the first

476
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:14,330
request is head admin f-ck editor

477
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:16,960
it's an exploit request right so when

478
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:18,710
that request comes in we banned the tool

479
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,240
so let's think about that from a

480
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:22,340
sequence perspective so we get all the

481
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,950
way to the top the first request comes

482
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:27,139
in we banned the IP address and the rest

483
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:29,300
of the tool I don't really care at that

484
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:31,820
moment what's in it because it all fails

485
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:33,350
it's all gone and so doing this at some

486
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,649
of the organizations that I've worked

487
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:36,730
with

488
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:39,500
we've Auto been 800 IP addresses a day

489
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:40,850
like just automatically banned them like

490
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,890
the second you touch us anywhere in a

491
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:43,620
no-no spot like you're out of there like

492
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:45,809
you

493
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:47,850
and so to give you an idea the

494
00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:50,940
effectiveness and that the of that the

495
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:52,620
pen test team called us up in my sock

496
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:55,520
and they said can you please whitelist

497
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:59,100
our RP our IP addresses

498
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,540
why I think I was like well we keep

499
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:09,449
trying to start up the thing and we keep

500
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:11,250
getting banned hey wait a second no no

501
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:12,750
bro you got to give him I like you

502
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,340
giving my infrastructure with all this

503
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:17,000
defenses then you've really done a pen

504
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:19,740
test right next slide please

505
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
so all right so this one this is a

506
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,559
little bit more intricate but it's a

507
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,350
really interesting scenario so that

508
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,910
you'll see there's these explode

509
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:29,040
explosions of data points coming out of

510
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:31,410
a central point looks almost like orbit

511
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:35,610
it's three dimensions at the center of

512
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:38,040
those are source IPs and exploding out

513
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:39,719
from them or all the URL get requests or

514
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:41,549
head or you know what I want a reverb

515
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,799
pick your verb here okay

516
00:19:41,549 --> 00:19:45,780
and so it looks like it's in three

517
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:48,990
dimensions around the tool and there's

518
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:51,389
only two source IPS here what's super

519
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:53,910
interesting about this is that the ones

520
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:57,270
that are marked in red are overlaps

521
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:58,799
meaning these two different tools which

522
00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:02,960
are designed to attack web

523
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:07,470
infrastructure make overlapping requests

524
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:09,900
so if I can find one of those and ban

525
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:12,650
that infrastructure coming in towards me

526
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:15,690
that IP address that whatever it is I've

527
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:16,890
lately like just by accident like

528
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:21,240
because of coolness

529
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:23,490
I've been to tools so there's a snowball

530
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:25,440
effect here as you do this and you start

531
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:27,210
knocking down infrastructure where

532
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,520
you're going to start to overlap tools

533
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:31,380
and see patterns that that occur within

534
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,090
them and I'll show you precisely how to

535
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:34,620
start with this inside of your logs if

536
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:39,540
you've got access to them from any

537
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:43,979
direction right next slide please

538
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:45,450
all right let's talk about the

539
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,770
methodology and approach here like how

540
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:50,400
can you actually do this inside your

541
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:51,810
enterprise next slide so one of the

542
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,640
biggest things that I see happening in

543
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:55,260
security operation centers is that we

544
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,180
have to start with the basics right

545
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:58,410
crawl walk run there's a lot of

546
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,790
organizations out there that are

547
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:01,500
attempting to buy tools that are going

548
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:03,990
to get them to the top and the most and

549
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:07,710
the the most advanced capability

550
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:09,060
immediately I haven't yet seen a lot of

551
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:11,820
scenarios where that's been super

552
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:15,990
successful and part of the reason why is

553
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:17,820
we have to build from transparency so

554
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:20,100
you start by seeing what's happening I

555
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:22,409
couldn't analyze those web logs if I

556
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:25,050
didn't have the f5 load balancers coming

557
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:26,910
in or I didn't have access to those web

558
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:28,320
logs on those servers in order to be

559
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,370
able to conduct the analysis I couldn't

560
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,220
tell you what was going on in our

561
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:35,429
infrastructure unless I could see it the

562
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:36,900
second one is in signal-to-noise what's

563
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:40,020
the difference between an alert that I

564
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:41,310
do care about an alert I don't I'll give

565
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:43,290
you a one example of this we recently

566
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:45,360
did a threat hunt in an organization

567
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:49,200
that had uh needy arm not going to say

568
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:51,090
which one and they had 550 alerts all

569
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,880
right so like all sorts of things are

570
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:58,199
happening but 550 things came out and

571
00:21:53,880 --> 00:22:01,770
said this is an attack of 'el that 550

572
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:03,480
only one needed action and it was if I

573
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:09,240
remember it it was a really nasty piece

574
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:11,670
of malware and so what is that signal

575
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,080
that signals like 0.2% or something

576
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:14,610
right don't don't ask me to do math that

577
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:17,159
fast I can't do that right

578
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:18,600
it's like point two percent so you gotta

579
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:21,330
figure out what the signal is to the

580
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:23,939
noise but once you get to that you get

581
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:25,710
to actionable alarms so some of the

582
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:27,840
objectives I set in security operations

583
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:30,210
are I want signal to noise 35 to 85%

584
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:33,240
meaning if an alarm goes off it's got to

585
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:35,130
be 35 to 85% accurate something like

586
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,720
that that's the target goal anyway

587
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:37,860
because then when you're looking at

588
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,510
alerts you're looking at things that are

589
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:41,370
actionable and the patterns begin to

590
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:44,070
materialize

591
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:45,629
so I worked with a couple data

592
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:47,790
scientists throughout the years and one

593
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:49,950
of them basically told me is like

594
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:52,409
patterns do materialize it's it's like a

595
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:54,780
creative approach to data like as you do

596
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:56,490
it the patterns will materialize oh hey

597
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:58,590
it's a phishing attack ell we've gotten

598
00:22:56,490 --> 00:23:01,530
a bunch of those those are you know

599
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:03,389
those are business email compromise hey

600
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:05,490
look we've gathered all the URLs eight

601
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:07,800
look the URLs are all structured the

602
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:10,830
same way that's a pattern can we do

603
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:12,690
something about it won't you do that you

604
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:13,949
start identifying their tools and then

605
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:16,440
you could start building towards the

606
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:19,110
automation yes can some tools get you to

607
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:21,450
automation quickly they can but I have

608
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:23,490
seen this exact pattern happen almost

609
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:26,400
every sock I've worked in and built out

610
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:28,380
and consulted in so I hope that this

611
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,890
kind of helps set the stage of where we

612
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:34,290
can begin good at least as far as I

613
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:38,850
could tell okay so so let's really do

614
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:41,220
this pardon me mmm this week my immune

615
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:43,199
system is like the Grinch it's two sizes

616
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,850
too small you know that's just I'm

617
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,550
fighting off a cold let's apologize

618
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:49,649
so grab a threat IP address that fired

619
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:50,659
something good jumping-off point you

620
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:53,160
gotta have something to start with

621
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:55,290
you'll find all the signatures that that

622
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,940
fired so if we're gonna be like you know

623
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:58,050
mids or whatever whatever it is that

624
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,430
you're looking at could be a wife you

625
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:01,110
got tuned into your own infrastructure

626
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:02,940
that's why I'm not up here standing here

627
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:05,820
telling you how I did this with X tool

628
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:08,340
right once you do that go look at all

629
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:10,500
this signature fires for those

630
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:11,970
signatures go regression test them

631
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,880
through the past how many times have

632
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:16,110
those signatures fired a lot a little

633
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,700
what were they associated with and which

634
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:20,370
will start to get to is a hundred

635
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:24,030
percent true positive signatures like

636
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:25,949
this starts to actually happen when once

637
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:27,690
you do that find all the IPS that fired

638
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:29,310
those signatures and collect all that

639
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:32,610
metadata and what you end up with is a

640
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:34,470
good pool user agents bad ip's web

641
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:36,139
requests layer seven data you can use

642
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:38,470
that excite please

643
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:40,670
[Music]

644
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:43,370
so as you do that you can start building

645
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:46,660
custom arms custom alerts that are built

646
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:49,699
on that information and you'll see

647
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:52,190
things that are attacks that aren't

648
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:54,890
firing it signatures you can start

649
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:56,030
building custom rules for those right

650
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:58,540
there because they're really useful

651
00:24:56,030 --> 00:25:01,309
they're very helpful

652
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:03,920
then you regression test those turn them

653
00:25:01,309 --> 00:25:05,899
on and as they go to num and now you're

654
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:08,030
starting to get closer you find all the

655
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:09,679
100% true positives start tuning on

656
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:11,629
those signatures and you start building

657
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,470
a life cycle where you iteratively go

658
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:14,600
down it's almost like a Fibonacci

659
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:15,830
sequence the first time you do it is

660
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,780
gonna be a whole bunch of data and

661
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:19,370
you're gonna be like oh my gosh I mean

662
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:21,620
the second time you do it'll be a whole

663
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:23,139
lot less and then you know within a time

664
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:26,719
period it depends on your organization

665
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:28,309
it'll start to get really surgical and

666
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,720
you can say I know exactly what that is

667
00:25:28,309 --> 00:25:32,149
so we just did this with a health care

668
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:34,880
too we help them tune up their sim and

669
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:37,929
now they are literally firing on every

670
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:40,580
single needs alarm that fires except a

671
00:25:37,929 --> 00:25:42,679
couple of IPS which we know are super

672
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:44,240
noisy in their infrastructure and a

673
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:46,850
couple of signatures that we know are

674
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:49,220
not valuable outside of that if it fires

675
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:50,750
a signature we're gonna see it and we

676
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:53,750
know it's bad because we know it doesn't

677
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:55,940
happen okay and you kind of keep this

678
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:59,059
lifecycle going as you work in your sock

679
00:25:55,940 --> 00:26:01,720
and and you'll build new content that's

680
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:03,770
valuable next slide please

681
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:05,270
cuz you do that you could start taking

682
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:07,160
tactical actions I talked about

683
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:11,870
quarantine the IP addresses it's a good

684
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:15,710
example one example was you know if you

685
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:18,320
have a windward spawning CMD or power

686
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:20,150
shell or vbscript you have a vbscript

687
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,559
that's launching downloading an

688
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,920
executable and writing it to your temp

689
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:24,590
folder

690
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:28,429
what's the malware well in that scenario

691
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:30,080
I don't know but it's Bower and if I can

692
00:26:28,429 --> 00:26:32,080
stop that vbscript from running and

693
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:35,689
writing it to the temp folder it's

694
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:37,879
blocked malware and that's kind of

695
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:39,650
pretty good right just love to see these

696
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,390
patterns come out and you'll figure out

697
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:44,330
inside your enterprise how what tool can

698
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:46,640
I use how can I use it and ban it so

699
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:49,309
some other statistics that can give you

700
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,840
about what this has produced one

701
00:26:49,309 --> 00:26:51,440
organization reduce their malware

702
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,750
infection by

703
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,909
seventy-five percent who was absolutely

704
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:58,789
dramatic it rolled off a cliff and that

705
00:26:55,909 --> 00:27:00,620
was like four or five rules one

706
00:26:58,789 --> 00:27:02,059
organization we I dropped their meantime

707
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:03,918
to contain by eighty percent in three

708
00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:06,529
months

709
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:09,830
it was just wham you know so you can

710
00:27:06,529 --> 00:27:11,360
actually do this it's not necessarily

711
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:12,918
the easiest thing the first time but as

712
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:16,699
you dig through it with a methodology

713
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:18,500
it's cool alright and okay so one other

714
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:21,590
story to tell you

715
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:25,419
one organization that I worked in we

716
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:29,779
mapped out a bot and that bot was

717
00:27:25,419 --> 00:27:31,639
scraping our externally facing web

718
00:27:29,779 --> 00:27:33,350
infrastructure yeah there was some data

719
00:27:31,639 --> 00:27:35,389
on there that could give you too much

720
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:37,939
detail but there was some data that was

721
00:27:35,389 --> 00:27:40,879
on there and they started seeing

722
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:42,559
increases in volume over time and we dug

723
00:27:40,879 --> 00:27:45,189
into that increase in what we found was

724
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:48,168
a bot that was 500 IP addresses large

725
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:50,289
that was scraping data from their

726
00:27:48,169 --> 00:27:52,460
external infrastructure to download it

727
00:27:50,289 --> 00:27:54,710
not a single one of those IP addresses

728
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:57,019
was on any threat intelligence list

729
00:27:54,710 --> 00:28:00,200
none of that traffic fired in the alert

730
00:27:57,019 --> 00:28:02,299
but it was a business risk it actually

731
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:05,679
threatened their business they're trying

732
00:28:02,299 --> 00:28:09,830
to repeat and copy all the data and so

733
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:11,779
like once we knocked those guys down the

734
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:13,668
time that it took for them to stand back

735
00:28:11,779 --> 00:28:15,049
up their infrastructure come back and

736
00:28:13,669 --> 00:28:17,450
try it again with a different technique

737
00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:19,250
was two weeks it was about fourteen days

738
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:20,840
was the average he said they were

739
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:22,610
determined we knew who they were

740
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,990
we knew what their objective was we'd

741
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:25,189
keep our eye on the ball to try to

742
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:28,009
protect them when we advised the

743
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:29,450
business how to fix that but that's what

744
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:31,820
I mean when I say internal intelligence

745
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:34,720
like it's not going to fire any types of

746
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:39,350
alerts next slide please

747
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:41,169
so how am i doing on time I've no idea I

748
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:47,330
do okay

749
00:28:41,169 --> 00:28:49,759
so overall the concept here is applying

750
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:51,199
all of our energy and brute force before

751
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:53,509
we understand the posture what's

752
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,669
actually attacking us it may hurt us in

753
00:28:53,509 --> 00:28:57,440
our energy and you know we see a lot of

754
00:28:55,669 --> 00:28:58,759
conversations I particularly pay a lot

755
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,049
of attention to what's going on with

756
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:04,280
burnout there's going to be a good talk

757
00:29:00,049 --> 00:29:06,470
I really want to see it today on burnout

758
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:08,000
and and how are we going to deal with

759
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:10,040
that as an industry because we can't

760
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,310
hire as many people as we think we need

761
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:15,020
and we can't address every single

762
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:16,610
possible scenario that's out there in

763
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:21,680
order to attack so where do we put our

764
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:23,929
energy excuse me and I think that this

765
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:26,360
among other techniques this will help

766
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:29,030
apply and focus where that energy should

767
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:30,919
be it's getting 5,000 alarms in your sim

768
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:33,500
a day really isn't going to help you all

769
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:41,320
right okay so question thoughts any

770
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:41,320
comments yes

771
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:48,970
[Music]

772
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:58,019
[Music]

773
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:10,790
absolutely so in that scenario so the

774
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:13,760
question was along the lines of okay

775
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:16,129
using a regex for a URL request works

776
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,660
but not if it's TLS encrypted and you

777
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:19,940
can't actually see the traffic that's

778
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:22,280
100% accurate and so then the question

779
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:24,110
becomes alright is this a super

780
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:25,820
difficult is this a super prevalent

781
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:27,709
threat vector in our enterprise right

782
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:29,090
that's the first question should I spend

783
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:31,490
time on figuring it out is what I'm

784
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:34,189
trying to get to second one is where do

785
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:35,570
I have visibility do I have an EDR

786
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:37,280
that's going to show me what happens on

787
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:39,470
the back end of that I have a bad you I

788
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:41,360
have a bad domain and you can see the

789
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:43,070
domains even if it's TLS encrypted I

790
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:46,399
have a bad domain okay let me pivot to

791
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:48,770
the endpoint let me go look at what file

792
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:50,420
activity registry activity Services said

793
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:51,590
or what happened on the EDR what

794
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:54,020
happened on the endpoint during that

795
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:55,879
time frame and what that will begin to

796
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:58,790
do is then draw correlations between the

797
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:00,710
two and that will give you what the

798
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:03,590
command structure looks like on the box

799
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:06,290
which exploits being delivered how that

800
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:08,990
materializes it's a word I use is how it

801
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:11,450
behaves on the endpoint when it gets

802
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:14,000
that you know does it write an

803
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:16,130
executable file to you know app date a

804
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,620
local temp right and then when that

805
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:21,170
happens what does it do and can you

806
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:23,510
introduce truck sure from that side

807
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:24,679
because you don't have the capability

808
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:26,660
that I described here but you probably

809
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:28,429
have other capabilities now if you don't

810
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:30,230
have any of those capabilities you find

811
00:31:28,429 --> 00:31:31,580
there's malware in your enterprise it's

812
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:33,650
probably a pretty good idea to

813
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:37,040
investigate what's the easiest way you

814
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:40,280
can start to figure that out and I use

815
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:42,290
the word Start specifically a lot of

816
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:46,490
folks try to go from zero to a hundred

817
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:49,070
percent perfect it's like well we can do

818
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:52,280
some crawl walk run here right do some

819
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:54,020
collecting of logs OS query you can use

820
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,280
OS sec there's a whole bunch of

821
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:57,230
different things that will in tune up

822
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,610
your visibility and then help you move

823
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:59,990
along that path till you get there for

824
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:04,120
your enterprise does that help answer

825
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:04,120
the question okay absolutely

826
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:07,830
everybody else yeah

827
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:13,839
[Music]

828
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,279
[Music]

829
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:32,230
exactly the same to me I mean I don't

830
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,230
buy this

831
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,250
so mysterious

832
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:49,149
to see the thing

833
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:56,029
hmm okay so the question was around

834
00:32:54,250 --> 00:33:00,710
artificial intelligence and machine

835
00:32:56,029 --> 00:33:03,110
learning as a proposed solution to all

836
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:06,350
of these issues and why folks in the

837
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:07,658
industry feel like they're not actually

838
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:10,399
delivering on what they say

839
00:33:07,659 --> 00:33:12,289
okay so here's I'll say about that so

840
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:13,580
the first the first issue that I've seen

841
00:33:12,289 --> 00:33:16,250
is a lot of folks are looking for

842
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:17,629
univariate solutions to problems what's

843
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:19,010
wrong I don't know I can't figure out

844
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:21,490
what's in my logs what's the solution

845
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:23,269
machine learning it feels like in a

846
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:26,149
univariate but the truth of the matter

847
00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:28,669
is that's absolutely not how it happens

848
00:33:26,149 --> 00:33:31,820
so when you go back to that user agent

849
00:33:28,669 --> 00:33:34,250
string for firefox 1.5 the way this

850
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:36,649
looks if you map it out if you aggregate

851
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:39,590
the data is it looks like an exponential

852
00:33:36,649 --> 00:33:41,239
decay curve okay and the without going

853
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:43,908
to math II like because I'm totally like

854
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:46,039
a math Iggy can that's bad right it

855
00:33:43,909 --> 00:33:47,690
depends on the steepness of that curve

856
00:33:46,039 --> 00:33:49,250
to interpret it but it's right in the

857
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:51,500
middle so when you run a machine

858
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:52,789
learning algorithm and say show me

859
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,440
everything that's inside of this thing

860
00:33:52,789 --> 00:33:57,080
that's anomalous you're not going to get

861
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:59,110
that user-agent string because it's

862
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:02,658
right in the middle of the traffic

863
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:04,580
you're gonna get the really weird one so

864
00:34:02,659 --> 00:34:06,950
that's like one good example of this

865
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:08,389
we're in the midst of your distribution

866
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:09,440
curve you're gonna have the badness and

867
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:13,220
the only people that can really identify

868
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:16,339
that so an unsupervised machine learning

869
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:18,049
model where basically you plug it in

870
00:34:16,339 --> 00:34:19,549
turn it on and it pops out and goes

871
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:21,109
here's the bad guy right totally

872
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:23,659
unsupervised you're not doing anything

873
00:34:21,109 --> 00:34:25,819
that will show you some stuff but a

874
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:27,260
supervised learning model will really

875
00:34:25,819 --> 00:34:28,969
work in order to do that it has to be

876
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:32,899
driven by subject matter experts and

877
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:35,359
that connection hasn't been made yet in

878
00:34:32,899 --> 00:34:38,210
my opinion at the level that a lot of

879
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:41,598
these products are saying it has okay

880
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:43,280
and then the last reason is you're also

881
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:45,500
talking about string data this is a she

882
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,730
text and in order to do really good

883
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,829
machine learning you want to convert

884
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:51,679
that into numbers how do you actually do

885
00:34:48,829 --> 00:34:53,210
that effectively it's weird because your

886
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,190
log is going to parse differently the my

887
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:57,829
log and then his log and something else

888
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:59,240
so there's it's kind of like a way of

889
00:34:57,829 --> 00:35:02,030
saying oh it's like super complicated

890
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:02,828
not that's the reason why and so they're

891
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:04,180
coming to every

892
00:35:02,829 --> 00:35:05,950
they're saying I've solved this problem

893
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:07,839
but we've also heard that before I mean

894
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:09,218
people have said well you get a sim and

895
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,808
it'll solve your problem we have

896
00:35:09,219 --> 00:35:12,309
out-of-the-box rules you turn them on

897
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:15,940
and you get bombarded with noise and

898
00:35:12,309 --> 00:35:17,200
then you cry like that's but like tell

899
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:18,670
me that doesn't really happen like

900
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,808
that's kind of really how it happens

901
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:21,130
they're like well you just all you have

902
00:35:19,809 --> 00:35:23,619
to do is turn it on and everything's

903
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:25,119
solved the the salespeople that have

904
00:35:23,619 --> 00:35:27,130
told me something different than that

905
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:29,589
those are the ones I work with because

906
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:31,690
they really get into the meat of it I

907
00:35:29,589 --> 00:35:34,509
think that eventually there are some

908
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:36,309
machine learning algorithms and like our

909
00:35:34,509 --> 00:35:38,440
artificial intelligence I define as

910
00:35:36,309 --> 00:35:42,309
something that can interact like we are

911
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:43,959
right here so you know this Josh always

912
00:35:42,309 --> 00:35:46,420
last names going to escape me from MIT

913
00:35:43,959 --> 00:35:48,578
has talked about where AI is from a

914
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:50,829
brain perspective and the last I checked

915
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:52,509
on it was like a six month old child so

916
00:35:50,829 --> 00:35:54,670
I wouldn't put my six month old child on

917
00:35:52,509 --> 00:35:56,589
a sim though I am trying to train my

918
00:35:54,670 --> 00:36:01,059
kids how to be a security at elastic it

919
00:35:56,589 --> 00:36:03,999
assure you yes you know is interesting

920
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:05,680
somebody shipped us a package and in it

921
00:36:03,999 --> 00:36:08,529
was shredded paper and I wanted to

922
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,509
demonstrate to my kids what privacy is

923
00:36:08,529 --> 00:36:11,890
like if we sat at the dining room table

924
00:36:10,509 --> 00:36:13,509
and tried to reconstruct parts of the

925
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:16,769
shredded paper it was really interesting

926
00:36:13,509 --> 00:36:16,769
it was there another question yes

927
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:25,800
[Music]

928
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:25,800
I'm sorry I'm having trouble hearing you

929
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:36,519
[Music]

930
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:59,490
[Music]

931
00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:01,200
yeah 100% corrected so just so everybody

932
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:02,310
can hear like what this gentleman is

933
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,750
saying I definitely agree with

934
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:05,850
wholeheartedly it's like if you don't

935
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:07,380
have your own tools you can rely on

936
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:09,210
other people's tools to give you that

937
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:11,130
jumping-off point or you can rely on the

938
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:12,540
tools that you've got so ultimately at

939
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:15,180
the end of the day that's what Zhu Goro

940
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:17,040
Kanto story was so powerful it's like he

941
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:18,960
has 95 pounds of 5 foot 2 or whatever

942
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:21,900
size he is he's really small but he's

943
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:24,630
got what he's got and so he used what he

944
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:25,740
had as best as he possibly could and

945
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:27,630
that's the reason why I'm not up here

946
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:29,040
standing and saying implement the same

947
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:30,210
and your problems will solving this the

948
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,279
technology to do it

949
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:33,480
it's like in your enterprise it's going

950
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,280
to look different if you're looking for

951
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:37,050
things that are affecting only you in

952
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:40,970
the way they affect you it behaves

953
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:45,380
different ways cool

954
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:48,620
any other questions thoughts comments

955
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:48,620
yeah god

958
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:16,589
August Spence

959
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:19,440
is that something

960
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:21,120
yeah so the question was have ever

961
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,550
implemented black lists based on user

962
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:25,819
agents like we saw the anomaly and is it

963
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:28,800
actually worth doing so let me tackle

964
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:30,840
first piece and then second so first

965
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,480
piece yes absolutely you can do a black

966
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:35,550
list you can also do an alarm list it

967
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:39,450
depends on whether you want to see it or

968
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:42,300
whether you want to block it these these

969
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:44,910
attackers are human beings and so if we

970
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:47,940
were so we asked the question anybody in

971
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:52,109
here spell a word wrong but they spell

972
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:54,180
it wrong the same way every time anybody

973
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:56,160
oh yeah there's hands going up okay do

974
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:57,899
not ask me to spell the word definitely

975
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:01,230
you're going to get red squiggly lines

976
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:03,480
on the bottom attackers suffer from the

977
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:05,310
same thing that technique by the way I

978
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,910
used in counterfeit enterprises going

979
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:08,400
after them

980
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:09,839
fraudulent Facebook advertisements they

981
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,880
make this mistake all the time they'll

982
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:13,110
misspell something and they'll misspell

983
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:15,090
it the same way every time and then they

984
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:17,880
copy it a hundred thousand times the keV

985
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:20,250
you ever tried to convince IT to rewrite

986
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:21,960
an old tool for some reason that's in

987
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:22,650
the enterprise they're like I'm not

988
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,050
doing that

989
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:26,280
that was the worst week of my life the

990
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:27,660
hackers are going through the same thing

991
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,160
they're like well I can't kind of

992
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:31,200
rewrite that tool because it's two point

993
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:33,359
five hundred thousand places so yeah it

994
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,620
can be very valuable and then and then

995
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,120
the second part of the question is now

996
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:39,170
escaping me I got too far down that path

997
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:39,170
can you repeat it

998
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:44,740
oh is it worth doing yeah so um in terms

999
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:46,990
of enforcement the reason why I think

1000
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:48,850
this stuff is incredibly value is if you

1001
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:50,649
look at how I think it was Rudy Giuliani

1002
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:53,049
approached law enforcement in New York

1003
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:54,760
City now I don't remember if it was

1004
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:55,990
broken glass or broken window that's one

1005
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:58,210
of those things my brain just can't

1006
00:39:55,990 --> 00:40:01,419
click properly on but he enforced the

1007
00:39:58,210 --> 00:40:05,710
basic laws which ultimately demonstrated

1008
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:07,780
to the community as well as the real

1009
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:08,200
criminals that they were enforcing the

1010
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:11,020
law

1011
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:13,390
this happens believe me when I tell you

1012
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:14,920
it happens you start enforcing broken

1013
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:18,970
glass or broken window in your

1014
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:21,130
enterprise and you will start making

1015
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:22,810
other people go away a very wise man by

1016
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:24,370
the name of Bill I worked with told me

1017
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:25,630
you don't have to be the fastest gazelle

1018
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:28,359
and I heard you just don't want to be

1019
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:30,370
the slowest and so when when you're

1020
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:32,620
banning hundreds of IP addresses and

1021
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:34,120
blocking people and knocking down

1022
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:36,279
malware and it's really hard to get in

1023
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:38,440
folks what's happening is some guy is

1024
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:40,390
sitting behind a terminal and I I just

1025
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:42,820
say guy right could be a gal sitting

1026
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:44,440
behind some terminal and their boss is

1027
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:46,060
coming over them going did you hack into

1028
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:47,050
that enterprise yet the guy's like I

1029
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:48,670
don't know what's going on it's like

1030
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:50,020
every time I learn a scarran I'd burn my

1031
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:51,910
period dress I can't figure out what's

1032
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:54,100
happening because you better get on it

1033
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:56,350
you know it's frustrating for them and

1034
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:57,790
jagira even says that in his logs he

1035
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:58,930
says that when I started beating the

1036
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:01,420
guys that were bigger than me they were

1037
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:03,790
inordinately frustrated and what you

1038
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:05,760
want to do is frustrate them so you will

1039
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:08,050
ultimately build a reputation right

1040
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,400
across other peoples industries it's

1041
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:10,840
like well that's out such as such an

1042
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,820
organization oh man

1043
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:14,410
you have no idea how many headaches I

1044
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:15,670
had try to get into those guys it was

1045
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:17,319
painful like this

1046
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:20,430
there's humans just like us so yeah I

1047
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:20,430
think it's really valuable

1048
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:28,589
