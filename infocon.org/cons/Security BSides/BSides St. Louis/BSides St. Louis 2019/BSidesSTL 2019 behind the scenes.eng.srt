1
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:10,370
we are here at the mula temper in st.

2
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:12,379
Louis that's where we're holding b-side

3
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:16,299
st. Louis this could be a two-track con

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:16,299
hopefully everything comes out all right

5
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:24,320
and they could have put the

6
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:27,979
mental-health village out here look

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,240
slightly warm but it's not too bad once

8
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:32,180
what about someone running like a D&D

9
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:34,129
campaign and they told the party that

10
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:36,790
you see a gazebo and one of the guys is

11
00:00:34,129 --> 00:00:40,750
like I attack it

12
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:40,750
hi David what do we got going on here

13
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:53,599
raking in picking techniques pin

14
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:55,070
tumblers wafers warded lost pretty much

15
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,540
everything we've got security pins

16
00:00:55,070 --> 00:01:02,500
you've got a wide array of different

17
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:05,269
tools and lockpick sets for sale and

18
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:07,219
again we we do this for the same reasons

19
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:08,990
that the loft went to Congress in the

20
00:01:07,219 --> 00:01:11,240
90s about security security updates for

21
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:12,860
software it's informing consumers about

22
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,899
the defects and security problems that

23
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,520
we have in the physical security control

24
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,440
devices that we use and that we have

25
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:23,030
readily available secure most of our

26
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:25,460
valuables are their homes once once the

27
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:27,590
consumers are informed about this

28
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,390
they'll know what products to avoid and

29
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:31,460
what product to buy and the companies

30
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:34,580
that refuse to make better products will

31
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:36,559
then be forced to invest in RVs if they

32
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:38,149
have better products available for us

33
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,400
which is increased which increases the

34
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:45,200
security level for up to 200 our homes

35
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,520
our sheds our garages everything pretty

36
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,530
much David no problem we got set up

37
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,820
going got vendors setting up we got

38
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:54,530
registration out there beyond what you

39
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:55,970
can see we got Mike and Bob doing some

40
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:57,140
setup as well I don't have a signal

41
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,840
quite yet but we'll figure out what's

42
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:01,130
going on here shortly

43
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,619
