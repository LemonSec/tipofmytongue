1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
since i don't see anybody complaining

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:07,680
i'll assume you all can

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:10,559
all right well this is

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,200
uh welcome to hacking the owasp top 10

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,120
um

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,120
also known as an introduction to

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,320
application hacking

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,960
um for those of you who don't know me

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,199
here's

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,600
you know sort of a bio if you will

11
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,840
nothing particularly exciting on it

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,640
um i will say this presentation is

13
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,920
oriented

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,920
for beginners um you know if you have a

15
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,680
background in application hacking you

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,280
could probably give this presentation

17
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,960
better than i can

18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,360
um it's you know

19
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,200
lots more information is available in

20
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,320
the the reference notes is the end of

21
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,640
the slide

22
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,600
um i'm not going to go through

23
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,520
everything here

24
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,039
this is like i said just an introduction

25
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,320
kind of a you know

26
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:57,199
wet your whistle if you will

27
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,760
i do have discord up so if you want to

28
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,800
type in

29
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,920
questions as i'm talking feel free

30
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,919
i'll keep an eye on it

31
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:09,039
um now for some disclaimers of course we

32
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,400
always have to have disclaimers in this

33
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,479
on you know this presentation is

34
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,080
my opinion only has nothing to do with

35
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:20,960
uh my employer or anybody saying

36
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,320
um each one of these slides i'm going to

37
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,520
go through

38
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,320
is a presentation itself i mean you know

39
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,399
i talk about

40
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,079
in the very first slide i talk about uh

41
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,920
injections

42
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,240
literally you could have a day class on

43
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,960
that um so like i said this is just sort

44
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,079
of to uh

45
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,600
get your feet wet i'm maybe using some

46
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,119
terms in here that are unfamiliar to

47
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,479
some of you especially

48
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:47,520
if you are new to the industry or into

49
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,920
application hacking most of these things

50
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,600
are

51
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,600
are discussed in the slides at the end

52
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,000
but once again ask a question i'll see

53
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,240
what i can do about answering it

54
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,920
for those of you that are hoping to see

55
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,240
dirty laundry from a company

56
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,759
or from a website sorry you're not going

57
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,679
to see any of that

58
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,639
would not be responsible disclosure on

59
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,920
my side but you will hear some stories

60
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,000
um you're also only going to get

61
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,000
pictures there's nothing live in here

62
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,040
primarily because i tend to have really

63
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,640
bad success with

64
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,319
live stuff um and like i said you don't

65
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,480
have the time to sit down

66
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,399
to sit and watch me type these things in

67
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,840
in real life anyway

68
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,840
i'm also not going to talk about how to

69
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,440
avoid and fix these

70
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,319
that's a completely different training

71
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,959
presentation for that

72
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,679
so with that if you are getting into

73
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,000
this or

74
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,120
interested in getting into this you

75
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,400
might want to know

76
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,400
well heck where do i start well there's

77
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,239
hundreds of programming languages and

78
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,360
millions of computer programs there's

79
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,440
like billions of

80
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,640
things with computer programs running on

81
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,319
them so

82
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,559
you've got plenty of things to aim at

83
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,399
the other really good news is everything

84
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,959
you need is already there

85
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,120
um like i have on the screen for this i

86
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,200
just used a handful of real simple tools

87
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,599
all of which you can download

88
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,920
um now people have different opinions on

89
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:12,319
this depending upon who you talk to

90
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,440
some like cali some like parrots some

91
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,760
like pentu

92
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,159
some like windows again it doesn't

93
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,000
really matter you can do this

94
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,760
you know sort of application hacking

95
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,879
with just about anything

96
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,359
um get yourself some starting tools burp

97
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,280
suite

98
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:31,280
end map the owasp zed attack proxy

99
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,319
there's metasploit welsh and again all

100
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,959
these terms

101
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,640
if they're unfamiliar to you you can

102
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,400
take a look at the slides i'm happy to

103
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,720
send them to whoever's interested

104
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,159
all this information urls all that sort

105
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:46,080
of great stuff is also in this

106
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,159
however probably the most important

107
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,080
thing for a beginner to

108
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,519
download and start playing with is a

109
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,400
product or program

110
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,760
called web goat um it's from oh wasp

111
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,760
you're going to hear me talk a lot about

112
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,120
oh wasp today

113
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:04,480
it is a worldwide not-for-profit

114
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:07,760
organization that basically does

115
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:11,040
everything around application security

116
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,519
they have their top ten lists which in

117
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,079
this case is the top ten most frequently

118
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,680
encountered

119
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:20,320
web application security risks um

120
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,040
they interviewed hundreds and hundreds

121
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,960
of these

122
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,800
and put together a list and that's the

123
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,280
list that i'm going to use

124
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,680
and show you how you can hack the most

125
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:33,039
common

126
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:35,759
vulnerabilities out there another way of

127
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,520
looking at it is this is how you can

128
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,040
test your skills without being visited

129
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,080
by the fbi which is

130
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,520
usually a good thing again here's the

131
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,320
information if you want to download it

132
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,320
and run it yourself

133
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,799
if you want to do application hacking

134
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,759
you're going to need to learn some stuff

135
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,520
you're going to need to learn

136
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,240
programming languages and operating

137
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,000
systems

138
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,680
do you need to learn all this stuff at

139
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,520
once no

140
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,199
do you need even need to learn this

141
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,919
stuff it's

142
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,120
you can argue either way on this but i

143
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,880
look at it as

144
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,639
if you don't have a background in this

145
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,400
sort of stuff

146
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,039
it's just like not knowing how a

147
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,840
computer works you can still hack it

148
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,960
but knowing how a computer works how

149
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,280
networks are

150
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,120
hooked up the protocols that go across

151
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,039
it all this sort of stuff

152
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,160
makes you a better hacker it gives you

153
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:30,639
more capabilities

154
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,240
and when it comes to programs you know

155
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,720
if you know how the programming language

156
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,199
works

157
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,639
then you understand how the code works

158
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,759
if you're familiar with a couple of

159
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,680
frameworks

160
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,440
you know how these programs and

161
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,400
applications are cobbled together to

162
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,320
make a system

163
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,919
and yes they are cobbled together to

164
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,080
make a system

165
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,560
if you understand the protocols then you

166
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,840
can kind of pick and choose you can

167
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:57,039
see well ftp does things this way

168
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,520
so maybe if i try it in this fashion

169
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,759
over here i can get some information

170
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,599
so you know the more you know the better

171
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:07,039
um

172
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:10,319
so with that i will get into the actual

173
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:12,000
most frequently encountered uh web

174
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:15,120
security which is called an

175
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,319
injection um now at the very beginning

176
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,600
of all these slides

177
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,600
i have my definition of that which in

178
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,960
you know input that causes unexpected

179
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,639
behavior

180
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,080
o wasp uh has another much more wordy

181
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,680
version of that

182
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,240
uh if you're interested you can take a

183
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,000
look at this but basically what this is

184
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,039
is this is the equivalent of a username

185
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,319
and password and you know i put in

186
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:43,280
uh you know username of smith quote

187
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,440
or equal equal one dash dash obviously

188
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,318
that's not an employee

189
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:51,440
dad i just put in a random text for the

190
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:54,400
what they call the authentication tan

191
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,599
and when i did that it gave me a list of

192
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,280
all the users in the

193
00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:00,479
in the database now this is not unique

194
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,440
to web goat

195
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,560
um i have done this effectively exact

196
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,599
same thing

197
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,639
in multiple applications and

198
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,840
you know it gives me the entire uh user

199
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,160
list

200
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,080
you know it seems kind of odd why does

201
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,599
that particular phrase

202
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:23,280
smith quote or equal equal one dash dash

203
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,280
you know dumped the database for me

204
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,400
yep just like that um

205
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,400
like i said this is called an injection

206
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,080
attack and this is one of the reasons

207
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,280
you need to understand how coding and

208
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,719
protocols work

209
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:39,280
because that's how you figure out how

210
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,400
this sql injection attack works

211
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,400
oh and by the way i'm sorry if you're a

212
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,159
no sequel sort of person

213
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,679
you still have the same problems in a

214
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,919
nosql database as well

215
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,599
it's just a slightly different attack

216
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,198
and it doesn't matter what version of

217
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,520
sql you're using whether you're using

218
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,240
microsoft's or you're using oracles or

219
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,960
you're using

220
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,639
you know postgres or my sequel they all

221
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,520
have the same problem

222
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,120
and what it really boils down to is um

223
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,680
i'm hoping everybody can see my mouse

224
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,400
here

225
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,000
but the very first thing it has this you

226
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,318
know funky looking thing and that's

227
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,199
how programmers put stuff together they

228
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,720
build things

229
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,240
out of other pieces and when you get

230
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,080
yourself your normal data

231
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,440
you know it's you know where last name

232
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,240
is smith and

233
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,160
you know the authentication tan is that

234
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,160
number it goes out into the database

235
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,000
and pulls that information and it just

236
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,039
pulls a single one because

237
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,559
you should only have one smith

238
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:40,399
with that particular authorization

239
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:43,439
but if you use this

240
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,560
specially crafted uh phrase that i've

241
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,200
been using

242
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,439
um smith isn't that important you could

243
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,800
use smith or sternberger or harry or

244
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,560
ralph or whatever you want

245
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,160
it's the last two pieces that are

246
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:58,319
important the or

247
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,439
one equal one tells the sql program or

248
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,000
the database

249
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,160
that everything is true and i'll explain

250
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,959
why that's important here in a second

251
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,959
the dash dash is a sql comment that just

252
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,800
says ignore everything after the dash

253
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,880
dash

254
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,000
so you put that all together and what

255
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,200
you end up with is

256
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,160
select everything from employees

257
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,279
where everything is true so it gives you

258
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,279
the entire

259
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,279
list of the employees

260
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,680
again this is why you have to know

261
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,519
programming languages so can you

262
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,760
understand how these quirks and stuff

263
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,160
work

264
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,880
now it's really easy to avoid these

265
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,399
especially sql injection attacks

266
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,959
pretty much every modern language that

267
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:46,160
you could mention has ways around it

268
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:48,880
has things you can do to prevent it so

269
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,079
why is this one of the more common ones

270
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,080
out there is it because

271
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,519
developers are lazy is it because

272
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,080
they're dumb

273
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,560
well no that's actually not the reason

274
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,880
you

275
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,079
may occasionally find a developer out

276
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,399
there who

277
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,880
is unfamiliar with this doesn't know how

278
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,839
to do it in their particular language

279
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,560
but the reason these things are so

280
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,720
frequent

281
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,599
has very little to do with the actual

282
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,959
developer

283
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,959
but we'll get into that later

284
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,240
let's see okay

285
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,320
i'm being abused here on the discord

286
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,760
channel anyway the second one is broken

287
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,560
authentication

288
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:35,040
um basically it's not properly

289
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,518
validating the user

290
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,599
one of my favorite areas of broken

291
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,320
authentication are those security

292
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,240
questions

293
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,360
you know what's your mother's maiden

294
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,160
name

295
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,120
um what school did you go to stuff like

296
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,319
that

297
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,880
um because all you need is

298
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,399
a little bit of os int and you can

299
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:58,560
figure it out

300
00:10:54,399 --> 00:11:00,640
story time i was actually poking around

301
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,920
on a school site it won't say which

302
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,319
school either

303
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,519
and i noticed that it had these security

304
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,880
questions

305
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:12,000
well i happen to know the

306
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:14,320
email address of the hr person because i

307
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,600
had actually applied for a job there

308
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,880
and just out of curiosity i tried to log

309
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,720
in as her

310
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,720
and it came up and had a couple of

311
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,560
questions there you know like mother's

312
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,440
maiden name what's your favorite color

313
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,359
that sort of stuff and since i was kind

314
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,640
of bored at the time i went over to

315
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,800
facebook and

316
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,880
i did a little research on this person

317
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,519
and sure enough there was

318
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,040
her mother and her mother's name and her

319
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,120
mother's maiden name

320
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,640
she had posts in there about what her

321
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:47,760
favorite colors were stuff like that

322
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,240
okay just out of curiosity i typed that

323
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,439
in

324
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:54,720
sure enough they the program let me in

325
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:57,360
i had access to her account

326
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,600
um because they set it up improperly

327
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,880
even though she was only in hr

328
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,240
she had admin privileges so i was able

329
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,760
to wander around

330
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:10,720
on pretty much any computer i wanted to

331
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,279
um this sort of made me nervous because

332
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,839
i was

333
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,439
just sort of doing this as a lark so i

334
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,720
reached out to the school i let them

335
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,040
know this sort of stuff

336
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,639
but you know security questions are

337
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,360
completely useless when it comes to

338
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,360
authentication

339
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,160
um the other one you run into is you

340
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,880
know we all know passwords are bad

341
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:33,680
passwords are easy ways to get in but

342
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:36,800
sometimes it's hard to convince

343
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:39,839
projects of this um so

344
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,880
here's a little nmap command that does a

345
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,720
brute force password attack

346
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,320
you know against a particular machine

347
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,839
and port

348
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:53,680
um another story i had a project

349
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:55,760
that um rejected my uh

350
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:59,279
claim that they needed to and he needed

351
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,279
to enforce a password policy

352
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:08,079
so i ran this and then you know

353
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,079
demonstrated to them that out of the

354
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,519
three or four thousand accounts they had

355
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,399
there

356
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,600
i could get into something like 500 of

357
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,399
them because they

358
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,399
used passwords like password one you

359
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,519
know football team broncos that sort of

360
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,440
stuff

361
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,200
so they realized that was a good idea

362
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,000
change their password policy

363
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,360
then i ran it again and demonstrated to

364
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,120
them that i could do a brute force

365
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,880
attack and nobody would notice me

366
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,519
because they didn't have any thresholds

367
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,279
set up so then they did that

368
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,560
so then i ran it a third time and

369
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,880
demonstrated to them

370
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,040
why you needed to use multi-factor

371
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,040
authentication because

372
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,240
it didn't matter how good or how complex

373
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,959
your passwords were

374
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,680
if i used a particularly powerful enough

375
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,560
machine

376
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,638
i could you know spend the time figure

377
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,479
out what the password was and get in

378
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,399
that way

379
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,079
so it took three times but eventually i

380
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,839
convinced them that they needed to use

381
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,839
multi-factor authentication

382
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:10,320
the third one is sensitive data exposure

383
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,319
this is basically showing things to the

384
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,360
user or the hacker that you

385
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,880
really shouldn't show them now what

386
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,760
you're seeing here on the

387
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,760
right well you got the login screen for

388
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,360
web goat but on the right you're seeing

389
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,199
the result of something called burp

390
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,160
suite

391
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:30,000
burp suite is probably one of the more

392
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,399
useful tools for application

393
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,399
hacking

394
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:40,880
and what burp suite does

395
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:43,439
is it sort of gets between the user i.e

396
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,040
the login page for web goat and the

397
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,720
server in the back end

398
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,160
and for those of you that are unfamiliar

399
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,000
with the machine in the middle

400
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,760
that's effectively what it looks like

401
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:57,120
i'm intercepting what

402
00:14:51,760 --> 00:15:00,240
the web goat is sending to the server

403
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,199
and what it's sending is this http post

404
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,880
request

405
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,959
there's lots of interesting information

406
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,079
in here again if you do application

407
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,319
hacking you'll figure

408
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,920
you'll learn about all this stuff the

409
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,320
important things are things like the

410
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:16,000
session ids for the cookies

411
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,560
um go up here the origin can be played

412
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,639
with

413
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,079
i have examples of that we actually

414
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,760
won't go through it today but it's at

415
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,439
the end of the slide deck here

416
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,800
where you can play with the origin

417
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,959
header

418
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,120
if you get a hold of the session cookie

419
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:32,160
you can do replay attacks

420
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,160
you can pretend to be somebody else um

421
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,319
and do things under their account

422
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,079
you know really neat things like that

423
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,399
but the important thing here

424
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:42,000
is you'll notice oops went a little too

425
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,720
far there we are

426
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,279
down here on the bottom username is web

427
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,519
goat

428
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,399
and the password is web goat in plain

429
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,519
text

430
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,079
they didn't even bother to encrypt it so

431
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,600
that's

432
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:56,399
you know an example of showing things

433
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,720
that you really shouldn't be showing

434
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:01,360
by the way if you happen to be using ftp

435
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,240
by default ftp sends passwords in plain

436
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,240
text

437
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,240
which is why you shouldn't be using ftp

438
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:12,880
um xml external entities

439
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,920
um i keep warning you you need to learn

440
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,959
programming languages

441
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,439
xml is one of them um

442
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,959
although a lot of places use json now

443
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,440
json also has

444
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:26,638
weaknesses as well i just happen to be

445
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:29,440
using xml here because it was easier

446
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,399
so here is another web goat page and

447
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,000
it's sort of like

448
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,639
a a discord type channel and then over

449
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
here

450
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:40,639
if i type in junk i press submit this

451
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,199
is what is sent from the client to the

452
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,360
server

453
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:45,839
and you'll notice you know it says it's

454
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,320
xml it's got a comment the comments text

455
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,160
you know looks fairly innocuous

456
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,240
the other thing you can do in burp suite

457
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:55,839
which makes burp suite very useful

458
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:59,040
is you can change it so what i did is i

459
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:01,759
went in i stuck in this doctype user

460
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,560
root system file thing and basically

461
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:06,720
what it does

462
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:10,559
is it runs this http command

463
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:12,640
as a system uh instead of actually

464
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,678
typing in the word junk because i took

465
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,640
junk out

466
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,559
now if you do this and then you continue

467
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,880
sending it to the server

468
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,240
what the server will happily give you is

469
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,439
the root

470
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,839
file system of the pro

471
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,960
of the computer i'm actually running on

472
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,399
because

473
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:36,000
it didn't validate this xml

474
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,919
information and far too many programs

475
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,200
have that same problem as well

476
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,200
so that's one of those things that if

477
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,679
you see it has xml on it

478
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:47,840
you can you know try this sort of attack

479
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,840
and see if it lets you in

480
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:54,160
okay i see any questions

481
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,480
no still more hassling and i warned you

482
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:04,640
at the very beginning i have squirrel

483
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,640
moments and here is a squirrel moment

484
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,480
i've been talking about application

485
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,760
hacking you know

486
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:14,400
and the thing that's important for you

487
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,000
as the hacker is to figure out why

488
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,679
you're doing it

489
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,440
um you know packing

490
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,360
quite frankly can be if you don't have

491
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,360
permission to do it technically it's

492
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,479
wrong illegal and dangerous

493
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:31,678
there i've said it but the thing is

494
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:35,679
is hacking can also be a good thing now

495
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:37,440
i will freely admit in my uh adventures

496
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,280
in hacking and i am by no means a

497
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,960
professional hacker i am not a red

498
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,039
teamer i'm probably closer to a blue

499
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,640
teamer

500
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:49,919
i've seen interesting things ran into

501
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,280
a place where they kept pictures

502
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,039
people didn't actually realize their

503
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,200
pictures were being copied and uploaded

504
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,280
to this s3 bucket

505
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,120
we'll just say there are people who take

506
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,879
pictures of things that they really

507
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:03,360
shouldn't be taking pictures of

508
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:06,240
very disturbing and i i have been

509
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:09,280
psychically scarred for life

510
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:12,480
but probably my favorite story is

511
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,960
a number of years ago when

512
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,840
uh people started hacking video cameras

513
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,600
i

514
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,600
ran a showdown and i'll explain what

515
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,918
showdown is in here a little bit

516
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,039
and i just kind of poked around and i

517
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,120
got to

518
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,799
watch a video camera in russia where

519
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,080
they were building something and that

520
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:31,039
was kind of neat and

521
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,000
saw another video camera where they were

522
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,360
you know there was

523
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,240
as far as i could tell they were

524
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,439
watching watching a trash can

525
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,720
seemed a little weird to me why would

526
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,000
you watch your trash can but you know

527
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,880
whatever

528
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,840
and then as i happened to find a video

529
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,919
camera that was

530
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,480
you know into somebody's house and i

531
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,280
kind of i was able to rotate the camera

532
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,280
and i was like oh

533
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,720
i can wrote the camera this is neat and

534
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,160
there was a couple sitting there and

535
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,000
they were watching tv

536
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,559
so i rotated the camera and i was

537
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,919
watching tv spider-man 3 ironically

538
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,440
enough with them

539
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,200
and it occurred to me that's a little

540
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,880
bit disturbing here i am

541
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,200
hacked into somebody's house watching

542
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,120
their tv shows

543
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,559
so yeah it can be a little bit

544
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:14,719
interesting

545
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,720
but on a more serious note

546
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:19,440
frequently what i'll get is i'll get

547
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,240
somebody will reach out to me or they'll

548
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,679
go through

549
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,280
you know the appropriate channels in the

550
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,880
company and they'll say

551
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,200
you know i broke into your web

552
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,000
application here's the stupid stuff that

553
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,760
you did

554
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,520
kind of nanny nanny nanny sort of a

555
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:35,520
thing

556
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:39,120
that will not go over well now

557
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:41,679
if you're a developer you've spent weeks

558
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,120
months possibly even years working on

559
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,440
these programs

560
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,959
um you've devoted a lot of time and

561
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,280
effort and having somebody

562
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,480
you know basically do a nanny nanny i

563
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,879
broke in

564
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,840
you're not going to react well to that

565
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,799
and frankly

566
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,918
that's even assuming you're even find

567
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,440
out about it

568
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,720
because when you go through some of

569
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,159
these things you know you reach out to

570
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,480
the security team

571
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,880
or at least the email that has the

572
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,720
security team in it

573
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,880
you may not actually be reaching any of

574
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,080
the developers this may go directly to

575
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,159
the legal department

576
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,000
and the legal department will send you a

577
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,320
cease and desist message

578
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,400
yes i have i've had a couple of them and

579
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,799
it never even gets to the developers

580
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,640
so you know you kind of have to be

581
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,720
careful about this sort of stuff

582
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,559
yeah you might find a vulnerability but

583
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,679
that doesn't necessarily mean anyone's

584
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:33,600
actually ever going to get to fix it

585
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,760
now if you're a defender out there why

586
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,559
do i care about hacking as a defender

587
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,158
you know

588
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:40,158
other than the obvious thing somebody

589
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,720
got in quite frankly

590
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,320
if you don't know how they got in and

591
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,440
you can't duplicate it

592
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:50,000
how are you going to fix it so this is

593
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,760
one reason that i tend to get really

594
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,520
and i probably have talked longer on the

595
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:56,320
subject than i needed to

596
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,200
um i get really excited about the whole

597
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,439
concept of

598
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,720
red team do red team blue team do blue

599
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,159
team because i think it's a

600
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:07,200
a wasteful and and bad uh

601
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:09,120
uh separation but you know sorry you're

602
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,440
getting my opinions here what can i say

603
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,158
but it boils down to one thing if you do

604
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,360
hack

605
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,360
try not to do evil

606
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,480
so back your regularly scheduled program

607
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,080
the fifth one is broken access control

608
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,240
basically what this means is the

609
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,480
assumption is if the user

610
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,280
is able to log in then that means the

611
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,400
user can do

612
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:33,440
anything well

613
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:36,480
here's one way to check to see

614
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,480
if that flaw is in a program

615
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,880
so here we have a url and it happens to

616
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:44,480
go to this particular sql injection

617
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,440
page for web goat well i went in and i

618
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,960
modified it

619
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:52,400
to go to a different web page

620
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,880
and it let me no problems at all

621
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,840
so you might be asking yourself well

622
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,320
this is web

623
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,158
goat um you know you're supposed to be

624
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,760
able to look at all these lessons what's

625
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,960
what's the big deal why would i care

626
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:07,679
about being able to modify a url

627
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,320
well what if the url was a medical

628
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,200
system

629
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,480
and it was doing something like showing

630
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,919
you

631
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:18,159
record patient records

632
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,600
this actually is a real life example

633
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,200
everything's been changed to protect the

634
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,760
guilty

635
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,480
and this is how the developers went and

636
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,520
got

637
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:29,520
uh my medical uh records

638
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,600
i took a look at this and i noticed that

639
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,360
my medical records were interestingly

640
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,600
enough sequential

641
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,479
um you know it was page number you know

642
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,039
one two three four

643
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,679
five the next one was one two three four

644
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,720
five

645
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:44,559
six and then it was you know so there

646
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,880
was this nice sequential thing in there

647
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:48,240
so

648
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,880
just out of curiosity i put in a

649
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,640
number that didn't belong to me and sure

650
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,760
enough i was able to pull up

651
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,200
somebody else's medical records

652
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,720
the other thing you can do with that

653
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,760
information is if you notice it's

654
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,799
sequential

655
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:04,879
is you can put in a little loop because

656
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:05,679
fetching these patient records takes

657
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,200
time

658
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:12,159
takes resources so you can

659
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,640
quite easily overload a server doing

660
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,279
this

661
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,600
and have quite nice quite a nice little

662
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:19,760
denial of service attack

663
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,199
well i guess it's nice for you probably

664
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,679
not so nice for the uh

665
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,720
medical system and again this is one of

666
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:27,200
those sorts of things that when i

667
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,279
stumbled across it it was in my own

668
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,640
medical records and you know i sent this

669
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:32,400
to the i actually happened to know who

670
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,520
the developers were so i went directly

671
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,200
to them

672
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,039
and i said you know hey i ran across

673
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,440
these sorts of things

674
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,720
the simplest thing to do is don't use

675
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,520
sequential page numbers

676
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:46,400
oh sorry i'm not supposed to get into uh

677
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,799
fixing this

678
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,840
the next one is security

679
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:51,840
misconfigurations

680
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:55,360
i view this as it's when you lock the

681
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:57,918
door but leave the window open

682
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,799
cloud environments now i'm going to pick

683
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,159
on aws

684
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:03,600
here basically because the last job aws

685
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:06,640
is what they used

686
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:09,439
but azure has the problem google cloud

687
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:12,080
has the same problems

688
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,679
and a lot of it boils down to one not

689
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,000
understanding your security

690
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,480
configurations

691
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,159
and then two you know your boss comes in

692
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,840
and says okay you need to migrate this

693
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,440
up to the cloud you have two weeks to do

694
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,199
it you know

695
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,720
okay you're not really going to spend a

696
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,000
whole lot of time figuring out how all

697
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,440
this stuff works you're just going to

698
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,919
try to get it up there as fast as

699
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:35,360
possible

700
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:37,840
so what we have here is it's an aws

701
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,479
command line program and i'm telling it

702
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,678
to

703
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,159
look at all the s3 buckets and or excuse

704
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,200
me

705
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:47,520
uh use the s3 commands

706
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,640
ls for those of you that are in linux

707
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,279
know what ls is

708
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,279
if you're not linux ls is the same thing

709
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:56,400
as a directory listing

710
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:59,919
and you know here's a bucket name

711
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,039
and i actually tested this on my as aws

712
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:04,400
buckets

713
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:06,400
and sure enough it came up and said

714
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,919
okay here's everything in the bucket

715
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,720
which is perfectly good because i had

716
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:12,159
logged in as myself well then i tried in

717
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,480
a couple of other buckets

718
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,880
and i was able to take a look at those

719
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:20,480
even though they were shall we say

720
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:22,720
not my buckets and it came back

721
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,520
and said okay here's the name of the

722
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,760
bucket

723
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,279
here's the files on it here's the size

724
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,039
there's actually a lot more information

725
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:31,279
that comes back with this that i'm not

726
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:34,480
putting in here

727
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:36,480
well okay i'm suspect that

728
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,320
you know joe company probably didn't

729
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,360
want me to take a look at their s3

730
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,559
buckets

731
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:44,000
um what is it that they did wrong now

732
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:48,399
the typical thing is

733
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:52,559
there is a user uh

734
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,960
excuse me a uh role there we are a role

735
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,639
called

736
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,679
authenticated user most developers look

737
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,159
at this and say oh

738
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,679
authenticated user means that somebody's

739
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,640
logged into

740
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:06,480
my into our aws account and they're an

741
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:09,679
authenticated user for

742
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,720
our aws account well that's not what

743
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,679
that means

744
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,480
what that means is i have logged in as

745
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:18,159
an

746
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:21,600
a double aws user not

747
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:23,840
for the company but any aws

748
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:26,080
this is a fairly common one most of the

749
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:28,639
time you get an authenticated user

750
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,158
you do start listing bucket names and in

751
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,919
the documentation

752
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,440
are in the notes here i have some ways

753
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,080
of getting bucket names if you don't

754
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,600
happen to know

755
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,240
it and you can pull all this information

756
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,320
out

757
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,440
and it's because things were

758
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,960
misconfigured

759
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,799
the developer didn't have the time to

760
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,200
figure it out and

761
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:48,000
quite frankly the aws documentation

762
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,880
while it's very

763
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,080
voluminous is not particularly good in

764
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,840
some situations

765
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,840
and describing this was one of them

766
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,879
cross-site scripting this is another

767
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,600
really fun one that

768
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,240
you as an application security hacker

769
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,559
can

770
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:09,120
you know just have way too much

771
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:10,879
entertainment with

772
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,559
you'll notice that there is a little pop

773
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,720
up here that says fred

774
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:16,960
okay that's very exciting you go down a

775
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:20,559
little further and you see i put in this

776
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:24,159
javascript command script alert script

777
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:26,240
into an actual entry field

778
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,600
um the entry field is supposed to be a

779
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,760
series of numbers

780
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,520
obviously the field wasn't being

781
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,520
validated

782
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,120
but why the heck did it run the

783
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:38,480
javascript code

784
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:42,158
well that's because what this is is

785
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,159
this code is sent to

786
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,480
excuse me this code is sent to the

787
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,600
browser

788
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,919
the browser is what actually invokes

789
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,199
this command not the server and not the

790
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:56,080
client

791
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:59,120
so it sort of steps outside of the

792
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:01,840
client server boundary if you will

793
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,959
and actually executes the java code now

794
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,799
there's three different types of

795
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,799
cross-site scripting there's reflected

796
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,840
which is what this is they're stored and

797
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,760
there's dom

798
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,439
document object model again more

799
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,000
information in the slide decks which we

800
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,640
won't go over

801
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,200
today now of course as an attacker

802
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,960
you're not going to use alert

803
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,240
you're going to dig through the html

804
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,360
form and you're going to look for

805
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,720
something like this

806
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,639
where they're putting parameters

807
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,840
directly into

808
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,799
a value then you're going to modify that

809
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,039
parameter

810
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:32,639
and you might do something like um you

811
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:35,279
know document cookie

812
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,960
uh and so you do that and that

813
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:40,320
information gets sent back to

814
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:44,640
your website and you have the cookie

815
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:47,439
that's part of the web page you know

816
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,600
why why is that useful and again session

817
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:53,039
ids are used in replay attacks

818
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:54,000
you can um log in using a cookie you can

819
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:56,879
log in and pretend

820
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,720
to be somebody else one of the common

821
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,919
things that cross-site scripting is used

822
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,919
for are like on

823
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:06,000
pages where you buy things shopping

824
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,159
carts stuff like that

825
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,279
you get somebody's session id and you

826
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,440
basically can be

827
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:12,480
them you can purchase stuff under their

828
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,600
account

829
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,840
you can use their credit card and

830
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,719
they won't know us a thing about it

831
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,520
until

832
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,039
they get a bill um so you know

833
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:25,440
cross-site scripting is one of the more

834
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:28,799
dangerous ones out there because

835
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:32,480
uh you can literally do anything in

836
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:34,480
the uh uh

837
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,960
script that you can do in javascript and

838
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,200
since javascript is an entire program

839
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,799
you have access to literally an entire

840
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,520
programming language where you can run

841
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,520
anything you want

842
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:50,320
uh insecure deserialization

843
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,200
that sounds like a really impressive one

844
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,639
um

845
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,640
basically what it is is

846
00:30:54,760 --> 00:31:00,879
serialization is the process of taking

847
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,679
an object in memory as the program is

848
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,640
running

849
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:06,640
and you save it onto disk it's sort of

850
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,960
like taking a snapshot

851
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,760
of the program you can think of it that

852
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,840
way

853
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,440
and then later on the program will load

854
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,840
up that snapshot

855
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,760
and take off from where you left where

856
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,879
it was left off

857
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,279
a great time saver um useful for things

858
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,080
like

859
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:25,919
um you know i want to you know stop the

860
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,600
app the program here and then get come

861
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,760
back to it at a later date i wanted to

862
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:33,760
pick up wherever i left off

863
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:36,480
so very typical use case

864
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:38,080
and but the problem is is you can go in

865
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,679
and you can change

866
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:43,600
that binary data there's one example

867
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,799
here how you can change it in a java

868
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,320
program

869
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:48,240
i won't step through how this java

870
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:50,639
program works but

871
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,480
what it ends up doing is it's a very

872
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,960
nasty

873
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,960
denial of service because this is in

874
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,600
effect an infinite loop

875
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,320
so your program will happily try to read

876
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,879
this

877
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,840
it will continue reading it will use up

878
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,760
all memory

879
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,959
it will probably you know start writing

880
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,200
stuff to disk

881
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,320
possibly use upping using everything up

882
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,279
on your disk

883
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,480
which is not good in a linux system to

884
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,000
say the least

885
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,080
you know so horribly bad things happen

886
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,200
we'll just put it that way

887
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,039
well for those of you that are

888
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,760
programmers you may be looking at this

889
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,879
and go

890
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,720
ah nobody uses java java is a bad code

891
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,799
we don't use java we'll use something

892
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,559
safe like yaml

893
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:33,200
well bad news you can do the same thing

894
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:33,200
with the ammo

895
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:37,360
just as a side note you'll see most of

896
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,959
the time that i might pick on a

897
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:42,240
particular language whether it's

898
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,720
java or sql or pretty much anything out

899
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,880
there

900
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,960
all languages have these issues i don't

901
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:50,080
care whether you're using python or

902
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:52,720
ruby or assembly or c or

903
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,000
you know insert language here they all

904
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,159
have their issues

905
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,760
different issues but they all have

906
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:59,600
issues

907
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,360
so the fact that i have an example here

908
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,120
in java is

909
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,559
solely because that's what i happen to

910
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,399
have

911
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:08,240
given enough time i could come up with

912
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:09,760
one in you know pick your language

913
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,360
so like i said here's the here's your

914
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,760
safe language ammo

915
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,559
you can do the same thing the problem

916
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,919
with this

917
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:21,678
particular yaml code is this thing here

918
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:24,960
load load will take whatever

919
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:26,640
as it's told to and happily load and run

920
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,360
it

921
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,960
a year maybe two years ago yaml realized

922
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:34,320
that was probably a bad

923
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,880
thing and they changed it to yaml or

924
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,639
safe

925
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,720
underscore yaml which is what you're

926
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,200
supposed to be using

927
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,440
that's great so anyone that's aware of

928
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,600
that who's writing new code probably is

929
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:49,360
immune to this

930
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:51,600
however um there's thousands if not

931
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,600
millions of lines of yaml code out there

932
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,240
that hasn't been updated hasn't been

933
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,199
fixed

934
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,799
and suffers from this exact same problem

935
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,159
if you think back to one of the earlier

936
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:03,120
screens i had

937
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:05,440
as an application hacker you have more

938
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:09,598
real estate that you can go after

939
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:11,040
then um you can possibly imagine

940
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:13,520
and i have even gotten into the whole

941
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,159
iot thing and the fact that iot tends to

942
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,480
use

943
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,320
very old and very antiquated code

944
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,560
doesn't keep it up to date

945
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,720
so yeah there's just so much to aim for

946
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:25,119
in the application security field

947
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:27,199
um you could easily spend your life and

948
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:29,119
only you know hit just a small portion

949
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:31,839
of it

950
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:34,879
as a side note these deserializations

951
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:37,839
are also frequently used by cryptominers

952
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:38,078
because what they'll do is they'll sort

953
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:41,199
of

954
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:44,399
add their binary code

955
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:47,279
to the end of the deserialization

956
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:49,118
code so your stuff comes up runs

957
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,639
perfectly you don't notice anything

958
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:53,760
because it acts just like it

959
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:55,839
is supposed to but in the background um

960
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,800
a thread or another process has been

961
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:59,680
started up

962
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:01,040
and it's happily doing crypto mining so

963
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,359
you know that's something you have to

964
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,200
also be careful about and again in the

965
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,680
slide deck i have some examples of where

966
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,879
that

967
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,879
has been used before

968
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:13,040
using components with known

969
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:17,839
vulnerabilities

970
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:23,520
i sort of alluded to this

971
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:25,680
in a previous in some previous

972
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,599
discussions but

973
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:30,560
uh the things don't get changed

974
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:32,079
frequently in the programming world

975
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,599
or they get changed very frequently in

976
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:35,040
the programming world sort of depends on

977
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,480
which side you're looking at

978
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,680
you know we're all familiar with open

979
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,160
source as a developer open source is

980
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,879
great

981
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,960
i can get this open source i can you

982
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,640
know save myself all sorts of time and

983
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:50,079
effort

984
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:51,839
and you know get things done at a faster

985
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,920
rate

986
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:56,799
now just as to give you an idea of the

987
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:59,839
scope of this concept of open source

988
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,760
um i got a little uh blurb here a

989
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:03,839
company called blackduck which

990
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,839
scans open source components and stuff

991
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:08,560
they looked at

992
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:10,078
1100 commercial code bases this was back

993
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:13,200
in 2017 so

994
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:16,320
you know that's three four years old now

995
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,919
and they discovered that 96 of the

996
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:22,160
applications they scanned

997
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:26,320
had open source components and

998
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:29,920
of those 96 percent the average

999
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:32,480
was 257 components

1000
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,480
or pieces of open source for each

1001
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,079
application

1002
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,160
so just sort of think of that from a

1003
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:41,440
scope standpoint

1004
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:44,480
96 of the programs you run into

1005
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:47,599
have 250

1006
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,880
uh open source components i can pretty

1007
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:52,160
much guarantee you

1008
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:56,320
the 250 open source components are not

1009
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:58,000
kept up to date some of them will have

1010
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,920
vulnerabilities in them some are no

1011
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,920
longer maintained

1012
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,040
some of them the developers have gone on

1013
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,000
to bigger and better

1014
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,880
things so you know it's just code that's

1015
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,280
been out there

1016
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,320
i mean i've seen code as old as you know

1017
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,560
the 90s

1018
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:15,119
that's still running inside of uh

1019
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:20,240
programs

1020
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:24,079
again a a great um

1021
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:27,118
a big area for you to attack

1022
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:29,359
um a great example of not

1023
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,720
keeping things up to date is the whole

1024
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:33,759
equifax

1025
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:35,359
mess um i'm sure there

1026
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,960
are i'm sure most everybody here is

1027
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:40,119
familiar with equifax

1028
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:43,599
just in case you're not it happened in

1029
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:46,400
2017 um and

1030
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:48,960
because they were using apache struts

1031
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:51,119
and there was a particular

1032
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,880
a vulnerability out there that you know

1033
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:55,760
they didn't get patched

1034
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:58,160
somebody or someone or china or you know

1035
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:02,640
take your pick who you think it was

1036
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:06,000
they got the private records for 148

1037
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,960
million americans 15 million british

1038
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,240
citizens

1039
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:12,560
and 19 000 canadian citizens

1040
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,759
uh quite the impact to say the least and

1041
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:16,480
this was because

1042
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,040
uh somebody didn't keep their apache

1043
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,520
struts

1044
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:21,680
up to date now there's lots of

1045
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,040
discussions as to whose fault it was and

1046
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,799
all this sort of thing

1047
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:27,359
which we're not going to get into here

1048
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,720
this is just an example to show you that

1049
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:30,400
you know even in the biggest of

1050
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:33,520
companies things don't get kept

1051
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,480
up to date now

1052
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,119
you know if you've heard of the

1053
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:39,440
heartbleed vulnerability this was

1054
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:41,599
what maybe three four five years ago

1055
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:45,440
something like that

1056
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:47,760
it was a very nasty vulnerability

1057
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,240
actually that was found in some open

1058
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,960
source

1059
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:55,839
code known as open sql or sorry openssl

1060
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:58,400
five years later six years later um if

1061
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:59,680
you run this showden's list of devices

1062
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,240
you'll find a bunch of them that are

1063
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:04,160
still vulnerable to heartbleed

1064
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,520
now for those of you that are unfamiliar

1065
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,319
unfamiliar with

1066
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:10,160
showdown it's a search engine that

1067
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,839
basically goes out and scans

1068
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:14,480
webcams routers servers programs

1069
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:17,759
everything and

1070
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:19,680
you can search uh for various things

1071
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,680
in this one in specific it's searching

1072
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:24,240
for heartbleed vulnerabilities

1073
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,279
you can say search for web cameras in

1074
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,560
the us

1075
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,359
that are made by you know a chinese

1076
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,520
company

1077
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:32,960
so you know you can get very specific

1078
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,960
and it'll give you a list of all this

1079
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,599
stuff

1080
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,800
um now again i sort of talked about this

1081
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:40,560
a little earlier

1082
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,079
and a lot of people take a look at or

1083
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,400
hear these sorts of things and i think

1084
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:46,160
well the problem is lazy developers

1085
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,920
developers aren't aren't keeping things

1086
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,598
up to date you know it's all the

1087
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,440
developers fault

1088
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:53,119
well i'm a developer i sort of take

1089
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:56,800
offense at that but

1090
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:59,119
in reality even updating something like

1091
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,960
apache struts which is a fairly

1092
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:03,359
well-known application

1093
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,800
let's say you find that the uh an

1094
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:06,400
application that you're

1095
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,640
or open source component that you're

1096
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:12,079
using is no longer maintained

1097
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:14,000
somebody has to write it um

1098
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:16,079
you know let's say you do update you do

1099
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,720
keep everything up to date it's

1100
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:20,319
not unusual that you will update

1101
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,319
something to a new version

1102
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:24,319
and your program stops working your

1103
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:26,480
program breaks so

1104
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:28,720
then you have to stop your development

1105
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:32,720
you have to stop getting things done

1106
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:34,160
in order to fix it the example i've used

1107
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,720
before when describing

1108
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,240
this to people that think it's all

1109
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:41,118
programmers fault

1110
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,640
is what which how would you react if you

1111
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:44,240
got a message saying

1112
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,240
okay the light went out on your

1113
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:49,040
refrigerator so

1114
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:51,359
we've turned your refrigerator off until

1115
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,079
a manufacturer ships us a replacement

1116
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:54,319
part

1117
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:55,920
should come in the next couple of weeks

1118
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:57,920
or maybe you might have to buy another

1119
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,240
refrigerator

1120
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:02,000
yeah that's pretty much the same thing

1121
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,000
as going to a company and saying

1122
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,520
you know you have this code that needs

1123
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,440
to be updated so you should stop

1124
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:10,079
everything you're doing and update it

1125
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,640
it just doesn't work in the real world

1126
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:13,119
um

1127
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:14,720
is this a problem yes is it something

1128
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:17,119
that needs to be addressed

1129
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,319
yes is it something i have a solution

1130
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:19,200
for and i'm going to tell you about

1131
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:21,279
right now

1132
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,480
no because unfortunately it's a common

1133
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,960
issue

1134
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,000
but the key thing here is that i'm

1135
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:29,280
trying to

1136
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:32,400
in in my poor way to point out here

1137
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:34,560
is this isn't a blame game

1138
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,040
you know because you found a problem in

1139
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:39,040
a program doesn't mean the program's bad

1140
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,560
it doesn't mean that the development you

1141
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,640
know group is lazy

1142
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,799
what it means is that this sort of stuff

1143
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,920
needs to be given to the developers and

1144
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,079
the architects

1145
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,200
so that they can come up with a good way

1146
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:51,680
or a

1147
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:54,078
clean way of updating and fixing their

1148
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,078
program

1149
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:58,799
so with that public service message

1150
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:00,960
we'll continue on here

1151
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,160
this is probably my all-time favorite

1152
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,680
picture

1153
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,279
i don't know how well it's going to come

1154
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,879
across on the twitch screen since i

1155
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,760
don't have twitch up and running at this

1156
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,160
point

1157
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,359
but if you look down at the very bottom

1158
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:14,000
of this picture

1159
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:15,680
you'll see that there's a pair of shoes

1160
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,520
here

1161
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:19,680
and if you look real carefully you'll

1162
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:22,240
see somebody is wearing

1163
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:23,118
some sort of clothes or a cloak that

1164
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,839
lets them

1165
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:28,400
almost perfectly blend in with the

1166
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:28,400
background

1167
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:34,720
this is what you as an application

1168
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:37,759
hacker really want to do as well

1169
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:40,560
you want to blend into the program you

1170
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:44,480
want to blend into the system

1171
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:47,520
um and this is an area that developers

1172
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:50,000
tend to overlook you know they'll write

1173
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:53,319
logs they'll write

1174
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,040
monitoring stuff but they won't

1175
00:42:53,319 --> 00:42:57,359
necessarily make them

1176
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:59,119
or protect them so you can get in and

1177
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:01,119
you can you know delete the fact that

1178
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:04,000
you got into the system

1179
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:05,680
um you can find some interesting

1180
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,359
information i've seen logs where

1181
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,598
passwords were put in

1182
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:10,960
um just as part of the normal you know

1183
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:12,560
development process because

1184
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,160
the developer wanted to be able to

1185
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:17,520
reproduce

1186
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:19,680
an error if it happened you can see

1187
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:22,000
session ids a lot of times a developer

1188
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:24,799
will simply dump the contents of an

1189
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,319
http request which will include session

1190
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,400
ids and you know

1191
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:30,240
as you know you saw earlier that with

1192
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,079
the open goat it might even have a

1193
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,000
unencrypted passwords and stuff like

1194
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:35,920
that

1195
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,160
okay i'm doing this for a good purpose

1196
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,760
why would i want to disguise myself

1197
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:42,399
well part of the reason that you're

1198
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,119
disguising yourself is to make sure that

1199
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,319
the

1200
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:49,760
uh monitoring software can catch you

1201
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:53,119
um you know they say that the

1202
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:54,800
typical time to detect a breach is 200

1203
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:58,160
days

1204
00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:00,400
that's scary to say the least

1205
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,920
so you sort of want to when you're

1206
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,319
helping out a team when you're doing

1207
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,160
your

1208
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:06,319
your penetration testing when you're

1209
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:08,720
doing your red team engagement

1210
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:09,359
when you as a developer are poking

1211
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,078
around

1212
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:13,440
you know testing out your program or if

1213
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:15,119
your security guy

1214
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,119
you know helping out the development

1215
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:20,480
team you want to try to get

1216
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:23,200
that monitoring that detection down

1217
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:25,200
as quick as possible you know just

1218
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:29,118
imagine what a professional

1219
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:31,919
malware hacker can do in 200 days

1220
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:33,440
um so that's sort of the interesting

1221
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,040
thing with that one

1222
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:38,000
and that's where logs can be very

1223
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:40,560
important because these logs are

1224
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,560
absorbed and read in by security

1225
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:45,279
operations centers by monitoring

1226
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:47,040
programs they're evaluated by

1227
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,800
machine learning and all this sort of

1228
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:52,319
stuff and they're supposed to

1229
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:55,680
catch this sort of stuff i can't

1230
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:57,599
even begin to tell you how many programs

1231
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:59,598
i've done

1232
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:00,720
pseudo-penetration tests on even just

1233
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:03,280
the brute force stuff

1234
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:04,399
like that example i had earlier in the

1235
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,319
presentation

1236
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,599
where i was doing brute force attacks i

1237
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:09,599
was literally sending

1238
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:10,640
thousands and thousands of password

1239
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:13,920
requests

1240
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:17,118
um you know a minute and or a second

1241
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,599
and no alarms were going off you know

1242
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:19,599
that's an

1243
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:21,680
indication that i'm sorry something

1244
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:25,359
wrong with set up in your system

1245
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:27,759
those sorts of quite obvious

1246
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:29,598
red team efforts should be caught

1247
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:33,359
immediately

1248
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:37,200
but frequently they aren't so any rate

1249
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:38,799
um that is pretty much my time

1250
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,720
i'm actually on time which is very

1251
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,240
unusual for me so

1252
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:44,319
you know this is time for question and

1253
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,839
answers if you've got any um here's some

1254
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:47,279
information if you want to reach out to

1255
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:48,078
me like i said i'm happy to send the

1256
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,319
slide deck

1257
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:51,359
which has got a lot more information in

1258
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:52,880
it

1259
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:55,119
if you want to reach out and ask me

1260
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:58,880
questions that's fine too

1261
00:45:55,119 --> 00:46:01,839
and with that i will turn it over to

1262
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,839
the moderator

1263
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:13,599
okay thank you very much greg

1264
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,760
so as you said if you have any uh

1265
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:18,720
questions you can jump in the discord

1266
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:20,240
uh check the b-sides denver twitter for

1267
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,759
all the links throughout the day we're

1268
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:23,839
using different discords for different

1269
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:26,960
speakers

1270
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:27,520
just for you know isolation keep one of

1271
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,200
these

1272
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,720
hooligans away from the other that kind

1273
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:33,040
of thing

1274
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,000
we've got about 15 minutes uh it's quite

1275
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,960
a bit of time

1276
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,480
plenty for questions they don't have to

1277
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,319
be about the talk you can also ask them

1278
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:43,040
other inappropriate questions

1279
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:44,800
or you can ask uh telecon you know tales

1280
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:47,119
from back in the day

1281
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:49,440
uh which goes back quite a ways i mean

1282
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:49,440
really

1283
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:53,920
yeah respond to a couple of these things

1284
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:56,240
here um and no it's not ask for

1285
00:46:53,920 --> 00:47:00,880
forgiveness instead of permission

1286
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:00,879
um let's see here

1287
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:06,000
now somebody else when we were talking

1288
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:08,959
about security questions

1289
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,720
they made a very um you know very good

1290
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,640
comment here about

1291
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:14,879
you don't actually have to answer the

1292
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:17,920
security questions correctly

1293
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:19,359
um you know the the you know

1294
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:21,599
company isn't going to go out and make

1295
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:22,720
sure that you use the correct mother's

1296
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:24,480
maiden name

1297
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:26,558
so a lot of people will just stick in

1298
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,720
random information there

1299
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:30,720
um that's certainly a one way of

1300
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:34,160
handling those security questions

1301
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:35,200
um if you type in you know 45 characters

1302
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,960
of random garbage

1303
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:39,598
chances are i'm not going to figure that

1304
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:42,000
out very well

1305
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:43,040
i have however seen situations where

1306
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,480
they will actually

1307
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:49,680
do basically brute force guessing on

1308
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:51,280
some of this stuff i wouldn't be

1309
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,480
surprised if at some point they're going

1310
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,160
to start you know

1311
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:57,200
just doing random characters sort of

1312
00:47:54,160 --> 00:48:00,640
like password spraying if you will

1313
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:03,680
um i suspect that most

1314
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:04,558
of those question and or security

1315
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:08,000
questions

1316
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:09,920
aren't well monitored so would not

1317
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,040
surprise me if people start doing that

1318
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,480
sort of stuff

1319
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,319
because like i said i doubt they're

1320
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:16,960
monitored i doubt there is any

1321
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:19,040
thresholds associated with them

1322
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,720
um but you know that's actually a very

1323
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,200
good way to handle the security

1324
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:24,720
questions

1325
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,720
is don't put in the real answers

1326
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:38,480
um let's see here

1327
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:38,480
um looking through

1328
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:49,119
yeah a lot of hassling on this okay

1329
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:51,440
i think those were all the

1330
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:51,440
ah

1331
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,680
there's a question at the end there for

1332
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:57,920
you

1333
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:59,200
if i had everything to do over again

1334
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,960
what would i do differently from a

1335
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:05,118
programming standpoint

1336
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:07,440
um that's actually a very good question

1337
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:07,440
um

1338
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:16,319
it's hard to say um you know one of the

1339
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:18,960
examples i've used is

1340
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:20,160
you know decades ago when i wrote

1341
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:23,680
programs

1342
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:27,200
i wrote programs that had

1343
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:27,200
sql injection attacks in them

1344
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:33,920
and as a matter of fact you know some of

1345
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:33,920
the code that i showed in that

1346
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:39,759
page there or in that slide there looked

1347
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:42,799
exactly like code i wrote

1348
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:44,480
you know 20 some years ago

1349
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,920
that's part of the problem with the

1350
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:49,040
whole development cycle

1351
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:50,960
and it's even worse for things like

1352
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:52,400
shuttle you know code that you know is

1353
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:55,040
runs on the shuttle

1354
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:56,559
or code that's you know in an embedded

1355
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:58,400
system

1356
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:00,079
because you know you write these sort of

1357
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:03,119
things and you may write it

1358
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:07,040
as you know secure and as

1359
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:10,559
tightly as is possible for the time

1360
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:12,319
um but you know you put it into your

1361
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:13,760
your chip you take your chip you stick

1362
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:17,200
it into a car

1363
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:19,040
you embed it in your microwave and

1364
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:20,879
two days later somebody figures out a

1365
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:22,800
way around it you know they figure out

1366
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:25,280
that one equals one

1367
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,480
you know that can be stuck in there so

1368
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:29,760
now all of a sudden

1369
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:30,160
your code is vulnerable well what do you

1370
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,880
do

1371
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:34,879
i mean you can't wander around to

1372
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,000
everybody's microwave and replace their

1373
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:39,200
chip

1374
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,000
um if it's an embedded device you

1375
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:43,839
usually can't

1376
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:46,240
update it um you know so

1377
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:48,160
what do you do this this is a common

1378
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:51,279
problem in the development arena

1379
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:53,279
and there's no good answer for it you

1380
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:55,200
hear some people talking about how well

1381
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,960
5g will solve those because your

1382
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,399
microwave can now be connected to the

1383
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:01,040
internet

1384
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:03,359
um ignoring all the conspiracy theories

1385
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:05,680
with 5g at this point

1386
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:09,279
well if you connect it to the internet

1387
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:11,759
you have all sorts of other issues on

1388
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,640
when one of the chris's talks later

1389
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,400
today

1390
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:16,240
you can always ask about the dancing

1391
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,480
roombas which is one of my favorite

1392
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:20,640
stories

1393
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:21,680
um because if you connect something to

1394
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:23,598
the internet

1395
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:25,598
that wasn't originally connected to the

1396
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:27,359
internet i can almost guarantee you it

1397
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:29,440
wasn't written securely

1398
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:31,200
so yeah you can connect all the stuff to

1399
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,680
the internet and now all of a sudden you

1400
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:34,000
have

1401
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:35,279
trillions of programs that are all

1402
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:39,200
vulnerable

1403
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:39,200
so that's not a good solution either

1404
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:43,119
um let's see here

1405
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,559
uh actually

1406
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:51,759
i don't actually know of any good books

1407
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:54,399
or online actually no i take that back

1408
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:56,160
the best online reference i can't think

1409
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:59,680
of any books off the top of my head

1410
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:04,319
but the best online reference would be

1411
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:04,799
o wasp.org they probably even have books

1412
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:07,920
there

1413
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:09,760
it is a great place to learn everything

1414
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,040
there is to know about application

1415
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:14,319
security

1416
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:17,279
whether hacking it whether defending it

1417
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:19,119
um really that that's the place i would

1418
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:22,720
start

1419
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:24,720
um once you do that

1420
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:26,160
then it's just a matter of learning

1421
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:29,040
various you know

1422
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:30,558
things involving with programs um html

1423
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:33,200
and javascript

1424
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:34,079
are are great places to start to learn

1425
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:36,078
things about

1426
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:38,720
you know how your web systems work how

1427
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:41,200
your application programs work

1428
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:43,359
oodles of online examples i've got some

1429
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:47,598
of them in the slide deck as well

1430
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:50,799
um w3c schools is a great place to learn

1431
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:51,520
um there's hundreds of youtube videos

1432
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,520
out there

1433
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:55,440
that basically go into that you know

1434
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:57,040
they step through web goat for example

1435
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,720
here's how you break into the web goat

1436
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:00,240
stuff

1437
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:02,319
there's app things out there they'll

1438
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:03,759
teach you all sorts of programming code

1439
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:05,440
i mean at this point you probably don't

1440
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:09,440
even need books anymore

1441
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:16,000
you can probably just do it all online

1442
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:18,079
um let's see next question um

1443
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,920
that's actually a very good one which is

1444
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:22,640
which is more rewarding attacking

1445
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:25,680
software or protecting software

1446
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:29,440
um i'd say it's a

1447
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:33,040
faster thrill to attack software

1448
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:33,520
but it's probably more of a satisfying

1449
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:36,558
thrill

1450
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:36,559
to keep them out

1451
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,960
but that's me personally some people

1452
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:43,920
prefer the hacking to the the protecting

1453
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:46,800
some people for protecting the hacking

1454
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,800
i like to do both

1455
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:51,680
oh let's see here um

1456
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:57,680
yep good point there doug sands has some

1457
00:53:55,359 --> 00:54:00,799
great resources as well

1458
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:04,319
um you know but

1459
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:07,040
yeah like i said sans oh wasp

1460
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:08,640
those are probably your top things to

1461
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,400
learn

1462
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:12,480
about all things application and like i

1463
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,000
said you just go into youtube search for

1464
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:17,680
application hacking

1465
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:19,839
um web web attacks stuff like that and

1466
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,720
there are people there who are literally

1467
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:24,480
typing it in

1468
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:26,399
and you can watch them do it um

1469
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:28,000
you know great place to learn all that

1470
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:29,680
sort of stuff

1471
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,319
like i said at best this was just sort

1472
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:34,160
of designed to pique your interest

1473
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:36,400
but there are plenty of resources out

1474
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,399
there

1475
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:41,359
um let's see here

1476
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,640
um yeah well for for those who are

1477
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:49,920
thinking

1478
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:53,040
um i will say that i started my career

1479
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:54,480
uh my official career as a coder

1480
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:57,119
you know i have done programming and

1481
00:54:54,480 --> 00:55:00,720
coding for an extremely long time

1482
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:02,880
and i sort of learned security um

1483
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:04,480
sort of by accident it was one of those

1484
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:06,720
sorts of things where

1485
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:07,839
um you know it's like well what if

1486
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,680
somebody does this

1487
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:11,359
or you know why isn't there a username

1488
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:12,399
password around this or why are you

1489
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:14,640
sending it in

1490
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:15,760
you know plain text and that just sort

1491
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:19,118
of naturally led

1492
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:19,520
into the whole security arena now if you

1493
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:21,920
go

1494
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:23,359
far enough back i actually technically

1495
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:26,000
started my career as

1496
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:28,160
uh hacking uh i'll give you an idea of

1497
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:31,119
my age you're hacking

1498
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:32,799
floppy disks on an apple ii so that kind

1499
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:33,680
of gives you an idea just how old i am

1500
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:36,559
here

1501
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:38,078
but that sounds familiar by the way greg

1502
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:42,079
five-minute warning

1503
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:45,440
ah five-minute warning okey-dokey um

1504
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:49,200
so and frankly a diverse

1505
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:52,720
background helps a lot when it comes to

1506
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:54,799
hacking if all you do is think like a

1507
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:58,799
programmer you'll fall into the same

1508
00:55:54,799 --> 00:56:01,759
uh mindset that programmers do

1509
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:03,280
so yeah if you come from a religious

1510
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:05,440
background you come from an

1511
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:06,559
embedded background you come from

1512
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:08,559
networking

1513
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:11,440
i mean heck you come in as a teacher you

1514
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:14,640
will see things in a different light

1515
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:16,960
than the developer did and frankly

1516
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:20,078
that's great because you will see things

1517
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:23,119
that the developers will miss

1518
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:27,200
um so with that

1519
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:29,520
um yep the humble bumble

1520
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:31,839
uh book books are a great place to get

1521
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:34,960
that sort of stuff as well

1522
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:37,040
um and

1523
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,559
with that i think i've hit all the

1524
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:41,119
questions that are coming in

1525
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:43,119
at this point we'll be monitoring the

1526
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:44,799
discord channel

1527
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:46,720
so if you want to type in something

1528
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:51,920
afterwards that's fine too

1529
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:51,919
and with that ibfini
