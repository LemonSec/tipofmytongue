1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,640
all right so obviously you know hello

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,839
everybody welcome everybody

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,800
um this is going to be the general topic

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,639
today i think

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,639
if we if we kind of go on that way

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,480
business of the business of the business

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,119
you want to say some words on this one

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,840
because i'm going to

9
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,279
uh yeah you know so so so chris and i

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,359
were

11
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,519
lamenting back and forth about the

12
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,480
amount of soap boxes that we have

13
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,278
stepped on

14
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,640
and um the number of them that we have

15
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,120
piled up

16
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,320
to talk about and and one of the the

17
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,599
things that i think

18
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,960
we both landed on um was that

19
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,040
there's a whole lot of people who rant

20
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,079
and rave and you know definitely us too

21
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,480
included

22
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,360
uh about you know the problems of the

23
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,760
industry

24
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,600
and how we need to get our [ __ ] together

25
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,599
and places that we need to

26
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,039
kind of reform at what we're doing and

27
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,840
all that stuff but

28
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,280
i i don't find and i think both of us

29
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,199
were kind of in the same place we don't

30
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,559
find that there's a whole lot of good

31
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,199
guidance on

32
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,399
what the business of security really is

33
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,798
you know um

34
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,320
we've we've both taken our lumps

35
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,840
publicly and privately

36
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,119
um probably much more than other people

37
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,720
which means that i've had a lot of

38
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,320
opportunity to fail which

39
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,759
also means that i've learned some of

40
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,559
those times and other times i'm just

41
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,520
dumb and i keep

42
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,159
failing again um but part of what we

43
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,839
wanted to

44
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,840
talk about was a little bit more about

45
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,200
what what the business side looks like

46
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,280
you know whether it's starting your own

47
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,759
company being part of a company

48
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,439
um you know things that you can ask for

49
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,840
you know maybe maybe even

50
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,798
the things that we wish existed in in

51
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,600
this industry in a greater capacity

52
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,360
uh than they do today because i think

53
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,600
that one of the things that

54
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,399
you know as we go back and forth talking

55
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,720
about it

56
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,520
um one of the things that we find is

57
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,520
that

58
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,280
we're just such a new industry that we

59
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,000
haven't we haven't gotten our like sea

60
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,880
legs underneath

61
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,360
us right like we don't have enough uh

62
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,240
you know

63
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,640
whether it's mentorship or guidelines or

64
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,640
or

65
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,799
previous experience you know like the

66
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,600
security industry is

67
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,720
maybe if you're being generous 40 years

68
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,720
old

69
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,480
i mean and that's like being super duper

70
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,040
generous um you know

71
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,238
popular security industries maybe 20

72
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,400
years old

73
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,440
um so we're we're the new kids on the

74
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,360
block and

75
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,840
and we haven't even released a good

76
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,840
album yet

77
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,920
we're certainly taking in all the money

78
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,359
i mean let's face it i don't know how

79
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,559
the hell we're managing to do it it's

80
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,319
just like

81
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,599
whatever freaking smoking mirrors we're

82
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,079
managing to do we're

83
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,440
um we're keeping it well funded kind of

84
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,120
the whole logic for this one you know

85
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,879
business is booming i think on this one

86
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,400
like do you even want to go to this one

87
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:46,239
i think everybody here knows who you are

88
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,440
who the hell they are everybody knows

89
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,360
who you are i

90
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,120
am trying to get away from people

91
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,280
knowing who i am

92
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,640
tough luck it ain't happening i'm still

93
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,120
dragging you into a bunch of stuff

94
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,319
because

95
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,319
let's say this is your

96
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,079
let's face it you are one of the finding

97
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,760
founding fathers of this industry let's

98
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,800
be perfectly honest probably a finding

99
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,280
finding father i'll take that one off i

100
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,000
have found

101
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,720
more [ __ ] issues and problems in my

102
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,319
own life

103
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,159
and the in the life of the security

104
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,319
industry than i care to admit

105
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,679
oh man yeah that's we are going to have

106
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,799
to go through that [ __ ]

107
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,560
you know what we almost need to go

108
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,280
through i mean yeah we know the business

109
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,040
is booming

110
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,840
i think this is the thing it's it's it's

111
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,879
ridiculous how

112
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,440
fragmented this has become how many

113
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,000
subsets of sub-segments of stuff that we

114
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,680
do so whenever

115
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,920
any of us like strike out and go oh

116
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,680
we're going to go start our own freaking

117
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,280
company it's like which one of these

118
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,799
thousands of the ones that we want to go

119
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,120
through it's um

120
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,360
it's ridiculous you know this to me is

121
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,959
also part of the lump side of it it's

122
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,319
you know you're in the same buddha so

123
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,040
when we first started on this and we

124
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,640
first worked out this it was it

125
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,400
it was you know we were networking we

126
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,439
were programming we were coding we were

127
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,480
building systems

128
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,200
and it was a lot more it was a lot

129
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,000
easier to

130
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,760
navigate through this and then all of a

131
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,120
sudden all hell broke loose

132
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,599
and everybody decided they could make

133
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,840
money i think what are we at now 124

134
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,839
billion or 130 billion we're spending in

135
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,599
this industry now annually

136
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,200
yeah right and it's and you know you

137
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,918
have you have

138
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,880
averages on on the bad side of the

139
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,440
business it

140
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,360
you know you look you look at like the

141
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,800
pro-serve side of the world right where

142
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,000
where i have to live

143
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:32,479
um even even the worst segments in

144
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,520
pro serve grow at like a 26 to 28

145
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:38,639
compound annual growth rate so you know

146
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,840
even even if you're if you don't know a

147
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,800
damn thing about security

148
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,198
you just write the word security on a

149
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,960
like

150
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,560
parked website you'll probably get

151
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,000
contracts um

152
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,040
you i mean and that's the the damning

153
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,240
part of all of it

154
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,600
is that i think that a lot of uh a lot

155
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,639
of the way that the industry's been

156
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,800
funded

157
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,840
is is starting to you know we we see

158
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,000
these insane

159
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,520
valuations for security companies

160
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,280
because people are trying to

161
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,799
figure out where the hell they can park

162
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,758
their money and

163
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,000
um they're they're taking it away from i

164
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,400
mean

165
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,240
especially right in cobit times you know

166
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,880
our our industry is going

167
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,639
crazy you know the the tech industry is

168
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,000
the only thing that's kept wall street

169
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,960
really alive

170
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,360
uh in in in throughout all of this and

171
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:28,320
and i think as you start to look at

172
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,600
what happens when the millionaires

173
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,240
billionaires and

174
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,280
etc start to figure out where do i go

175
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,320
park my money

176
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,320
um we start to find the dynamics of

177
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,440
of kind of the modern day security

178
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,080
segment where

179
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,280
it's it's a little bit like kind of

180
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,800
early medicine

181
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:49,039
in like the the early 1900s right like i

182
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,039
think of our industry a little bit more

183
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,479
kind of like that show than nick right

184
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,479
where it's just like a bunch of like

185
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,199
coked out doctors who are like oh man

186
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,960
we'll just

187
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,199
rip their heart out and put it in this

188
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,120
other person and like it'll work

189
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,560
and they're like do it in auditorium we

190
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,240
want to see if it works then if it

191
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,600
doesn't they're like ah whatever

192
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,280
well just give them more money and

193
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,120
they'll figure it out well

194
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,880
and that's it it's like we i mean let's

195
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,319
face it we've been figuring this [ __ ]

196
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,560
out as we've been going along we've been

197
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,759
making [ __ ] up as we've been going along

198
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,680
and i think that's part of it and part

199
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,400
of it now has got to the point where

200
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,759
like the world relies on us to do it

201
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,120
that way there was like looking at us

202
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,160
going uh so when are you actually going

203
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,440
to get your [ __ ] together so you can

204
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,240
figure some of this out

205
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,520
i mean it's and and i think the other

206
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,840
part that just

207
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,880
fascinates me and not necessarily in a

208
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,039
good way

209
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,639
is like we get brought in to figure [ __ ]

210
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,000
out it's like okay look you know i hear

211
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,120
i need some of the security stuff okay

212
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,479
yeah we've got you covered

213
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,919
so we come in and we do everything we

214
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,440
need to do we educate we do everything

215
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,318
else and sometimes they listen sometimes

216
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,840
they don't

217
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,039
and then when [ __ ] goes wrong we get

218
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,479
brought in to help fix it and help

219
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,199
remediate and recover and all this kind

220
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,960
of good stuff

221
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,880
then when [ __ ] goes really really wrong

222
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,080
and typically it's ours not our [ __ ]

223
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,520
it's the [ __ ] that they bought from

224
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,560
vendors that sell blinky [ __ ] that's

225
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,198
gone wrong

226
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,560
they get charged even more money to fix

227
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,919
it and then they get charged even

228
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,960
even more money to get their data back

229
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,159
from the people that took it in the

230
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,039
first place

231
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,720
it's just we get we get them coming and

232
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,450
going we're worse than the used car

233
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,120
salesman

234
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:13,759
[Laughter]

235
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,880
it's i feel so bad about that but it's

236
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,160
true but like

237
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,919
i think um i think i think the good

238
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,880
thing about recognizing some of that

239
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,919
is that there's there's opportunity to

240
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,639
change it

241
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,719
yeah i think that it's it's more about

242
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,240
how how do we change it you know like

243
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,720
i i think the the cultural aspect

244
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,280
of business has changed so much right

245
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,639
like

246
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:42,080
you look at you look at whatever

247
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:44,479
50 plus years ago right and you say

248
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,199
what what is a business right what is

249
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:49,120
the point

250
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:52,400
of a business and every single person

251
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:56,160
subscribed to the point of a business

252
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:58,638
was to make as much profit as possible

253
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,319
because if you did that you would then

254
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,479
be serving the employees you'd be

255
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,560
serving customers you'd be able to

256
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,878
cost amortize all of these things and it

257
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,160
would do better for the global

258
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:13,120
and in local economy for you to focus on

259
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,440
making as much money as possible and i

260
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,160
think

261
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,080
modern business has started to finally

262
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,120
realize that there is a double bottom

263
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,919
line that exists

264
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,240
and the double bottom line is that there

265
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,120
is

266
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,000
a sense of social responsibility that is

267
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,440
out there where you

268
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,039
have to not only try and get the profits

269
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,200
but you also

270
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:35,039
have to make a difference and and i

271
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,800
think that that's the part of the

272
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,958
security industry

273
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,000
that we haven't been able to nail down

274
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,559
yet because we're just

275
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,279
too young as an industry we're still in

276
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,359
the like

277
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:49,279
[ __ ] it make as much money as you can

278
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:52,000
without really getting down to this like

279
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,519
is the thing that i am doing culturally

280
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,200
and socially responsible

281
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,880
or is it just me making a shitload of

282
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,160
money right yeah

283
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,399
this is the stuff we were talking about

284
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,600
we there's the ironically enough we do

285
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,839
the [ __ ] show

286
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,519
thursday night with uh evan and ryan and

287
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,760
it's just it's it's that conversation

288
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,279
and you kind of hit it it's like okay

289
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,720
we want to be able to make a difference

290
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,000
and i think that's where it's gotten to

291
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,040
now i think a lot of us

292
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,640
and this is probably part of the

293
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,360
conversation with the businesses booming

294
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,959
thing

295
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,560
a lot of us have taken that step back

296
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,239
and gone how do we

297
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,560
affect change how do we make a

298
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,240
difference and if it's one of the time

299
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,680
or a hundred at a time whatever else is

300
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,519
like that and i think that's maybe you

301
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,000
know you start looking a lot of folks in

302
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,519
in our industry who are maybe inside the

303
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,959
organizations going i

304
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,680
can't affect change that entrepreneurial

305
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,160
spirit

306
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,519
is like well solid if i step outside of

307
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,319
whatever handcuffs i'm wearing or

308
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,080
whatever

309
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,320
issues and challenges i have inside the

310
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,920
industry can i step outside

311
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:50,080
can i affect change more effectively

312
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,120
if i'm independent if i'm doing my own

313
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,480
thing if i partner up

314
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,959
with you guys i mean let's be perfectly

315
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,720
honest i mean look at where your focus

316
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,719
is look at the name of the company for

317
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,200
crying out loud the protection side of

318
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,399
it

319
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:05,760
the ability to come in effect change and

320
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:08,560
help organizations yeah i

321
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,360
i i'd really like to figure out and and

322
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,439
you know this

323
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,640
maybe this is an open thing and you know

324
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,279
a lot of

325
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,399
the beginning of this right we uh as

326
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,120
chris and i were talking

327
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,920
and as the the b sites crew as was

328
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,160
talking with us

329
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,760
you know we we had both submitted some

330
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,800
pretty similar like

331
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,920
i am willing to answer absolutely

332
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,959
anything

333
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:33,680
um and when i say that i mean anything

334
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,119
about what it is like to have been

335
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,920
through some of the [ __ ] that we've been

336
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,880
through because

337
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,160
i i have not been through the absolute

338
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,519
weird [ __ ] that

339
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:46,800
mr uh mr chris here has been through but

340
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:50,560
um i've been through my own and um

341
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,359
some of that is how difficult it is to

342
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,599
start a business

343
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,880
like my my immediate advice to anyone

344
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,320
who's like i want to start my own

345
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,439
business it's like [ __ ] it don't do it

346
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,920
it sucks

347
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,360
um it's it's it's terrible it's a

348
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,120
horrible idea like

349
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,720
live in the cog in the machine and just

350
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,200
enjoy your role um

351
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,200
but but there's ways to break out of it

352
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,959
and i i think that you know like

353
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,680
there's there's lots of things that are

354
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,079
like super taboo to ask and whether it's

355
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,680
um

356
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,519
whether it's just like you know people

357
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,880
not feeling like they can ask those

358
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,480
questions because

359
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,959
you know oh i have to seem like i know

360
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,640
everything or whether it's just you know

361
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,518
there is there isn't enough peering in

362
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,920
our community

363
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,040
and stuff like that i feel like there's

364
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,319
this like weird

365
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,000
root of you know we got so far ahead of

366
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,279
ourselves and telling everybody else

367
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,600
that we knew everything

368
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,040
that by the time it came for us to ask

369
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,640
somebody a question we were like

370
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,760
embarrassed to ask the questions because

371
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,079
we were like [ __ ] i already told the

372
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,800
person

373
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,120
i know everything and and yeah like

374
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,240
you're

375
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,480
you're like up against the wall and so i

376
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,720
i mean i find it super hard especially

377
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,160
in like business times of

378
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:59,839
like asking people basic [ __ ] like like

379
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:01,600
hey i've got you know 30 employees

380
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,279
and i want to make their benefits better

381
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,360
like who are you using

382
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,040
to get better benefits and like well

383
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,160
well you can't ask that question that's

384
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,079
going to mean that you don't know how to

385
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,680
run your company be like no just

386
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,279
i'm trying to hook it up you know like

387
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,239
and and i think that that same thing

388
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,880
translates like both technically to you

389
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,519
know like

390
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,720
how do i do the thing how do i how do i

391
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,399
try you know protect

392
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,000
something you know what's the coolest

393
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,240
new technology for something

394
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,519
i haven't been exposed to like i'm not

395
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,760
i'm not an awesome

396
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,200
you know devops engineer i don't know

397
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,360
enough [ __ ] about that to

398
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,800
you know hold weight in you know in

399
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,040
weightlessness you know like

400
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,560
nothing and and the best i could do is

401
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,920
try and lean on all these people in the

402
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,279
community that have all this awesome

403
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,079
knowledge

404
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:46,160
but if the availability isn't there for

405
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,199
for people to ask questions without

406
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,040
judgment

407
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,720
i i think that that's part of the things

408
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,480
that we keep getting into right like

409
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,320
somebody asks a question and

410
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,320
and they feel so self-conscious about it

411
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,040
that that they can't they can't ask it

412
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,480
and then

413
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,199
a whole bunch of people suffer it might

414
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:04,240
not be one person like if i can't answer

415
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,120
or ask that question for my company or

416
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,200
me

417
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,160
then how many people down the line

418
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,839
suffer because

419
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,519
you know i didn't i didn't have the guts

420
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,720
to do it or i was so self-conscious that

421
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,120
i couldn't do it

422
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,120
well that's when i mean you know let's

423
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,720
let's put it out there you know and this

424
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,399
i've got the slide up for good [ __ ] that

425
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,959
goes right but let's put it out there i

426
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,800
mean when

427
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:26,959
owl when one more labs failed um

428
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,800
and all hell broke loose with that and

429
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,920
then not long after i had to go into

430
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,000
bankruptcy

431
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,199
i put it out there i put a huge linkedin

432
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,360
post out there

433
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,639
for anybody that wanted to know actually

434
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,160
what happened rather than what they

435
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,560
perceived what happened

436
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,480
i put it out there i sat down and i said

437
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,959
this is what the hell happened

438
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,079
and this is why it happened and these

439
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,439
are the things i got right

440
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,359
i mean we did some pretty freaking

441
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,519
awesome stuff you know

442
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,959
this is the [ __ ] i got wrong and this is

443
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,240
how i got it wrong and it's you know

444
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,359
it's always that same philosophy it's

445
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,399
like i don't care you're gonna make

446
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,480
mistakes

447
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,240
don't make the same mistakes i did make

448
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,360
new and interesting ones and to me that

449
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,040
was

450
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,720
you know it's i'm doing it again i mean

451
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,399
i'm like the accidental one with with

452
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,760
hillbilly hit squad now it's like okay i

453
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,399
started back up again all of a sudden

454
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,839
i'm like

455
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,120
i'm sitting looking around i've got

456
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,320
somebody looking after me and the

457
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,639
company i've got somebody doing this

458
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,320
like

459
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,760
so i'm like how the hell did this happen

460
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,000
again

461
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,680
and i'm fortunate enough that i've made

462
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,199
those mistakes i've done those bumps and

463
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,880
everything else that i know to put the

464
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,399
right things in place to do it now

465
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,160
but you're right if i didn't i'd be

466
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,560
casting out what you and i i mean we sat

467
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,480
down when i was when i when i left um

468
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,479
when i left to calvio he came over and

469
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,399
sat down with you and was like okay

470
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,839
give me some thoughts i just want to sit

471
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,639
down and i want to brainstorm with you

472
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,760
for a little bit and

473
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:41,680
do the ability to do that is fantastic

474
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,959
but it worries me to your point that i

475
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,319
don't think there's enough of that going

476
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,920
on i think a lot of people are making

477
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,760
the same mistakes

478
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,199
but i don't think they know where to ask

479
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,480
for people

480
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:55,839
yeah and you know like i look i

481
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,880
i will openly admit that i'm i'm usually

482
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,240
not the smartest

483
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,639
person um on the lowest level of the

484
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,240
room

485
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,839
more or less the higher level of the

486
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,639
room like i'm i'm

487
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:09,040
i'm in the like my percentile scores

488
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,279
like i'm in like the tens

489
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,800
um and i and i get that right like i i

490
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,959
just i i can fake my way

491
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,399
through some things and other stuff you

492
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,800
know i know a bunch of magic tricks

493
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,959
enough to like make people believe in it

494
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,839
uh but but at the end of the day you

495
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:25,680
know i

496
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:27,600
i think that there's a lot of excuses

497
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,160
that exist out there and i know that

498
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,360
this is so politically not cool to say

499
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:36,079
but yeah whatever um you know like

500
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,560
there there's so many reasons that

501
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,239
people

502
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:43,119
say oh i i'm not given this opportunity

503
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,680
because of x right like like oh and and

504
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,959
you know

505
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:49,920
whether you want to blame that on your

506
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:52,000
race religion color creed sexual

507
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,959
orientation all of this other stuff

508
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,519
right like

509
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:57,359
there is a certain portion of that that

510
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,519
is absolutely true

511
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,759
right where where there are people in

512
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,399
this world who cannot see past those

513
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,360
things

514
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,800
but there is also a whole lot of people

515
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,680
who are leaning on that [ __ ]

516
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,399
and as a crutch like they're literally

517
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,638
leaning on it

518
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,560
as a crutch and they're stopping

519
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,440
themselves from progressing

520
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,000
and i'm fine with going out and [ __ ]

521
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,639
torching

522
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,240
the people that aren't able to see past

523
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,800
it but at the same time

524
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,680
yin and yang we have to realize that

525
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,639
there are

526
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,560
also a full sect of people out there

527
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,360
that are just not exploring their full

528
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,359
potential

529
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,880
because they're so much of a victim of

530
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,279
their own circumstance that they don't

531
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,439
give themselves permission to succeed

532
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,120
and i think that just like you know i

533
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,399
mean and literally i'm sitting here

534
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,759
thinking that right looking at the

535
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,839
discord channel that

536
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,040
that like there's gatekeeping [ __ ] yeah

537
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,040
there's gatekeeping

538
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,160
yeah there is and you know what some of

539
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,240
it absolutely

540
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,199
should be [ __ ] gate kept some of it

541
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,959
just like

542
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:57,199
ken you know with a conversation we had

543
00:16:54,959 --> 00:17:00,160
yesterday just because i took

544
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:01,279
one class in blacksmithing means that

545
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,199
i'm a blacksmith

546
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:05,359
[ __ ] no you can't do [ __ ] as a

547
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,678
blacksmith you the best you know how to

548
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:09,359
do

549
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,799
is is light metal and and probably light

550
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,438
your whole [ __ ] house on fire and

551
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,599
destroy

552
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,839
everything that you're going to do so

553
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:18,240
are there things that need to be kept

554
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,039
in order to create experience for people

555
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,240
to have

556
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:24,959
a level of survivability 100

557
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,720
yes does that have anything to do with

558
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,840
who you [ __ ] or who you pray to

559
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,320
no it doesn't but but i think that there

560
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,918
is a

561
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:37,120
reason that some of us need to keep

562
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:39,039
an eye on whether this is a actual

563
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,399
gatekeeping thing right like oh yeah

564
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,679
well you're just part of the big ol you

565
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,720
know good old boys club

566
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:46,240
or is it truly like look you only have a

567
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,320
year worth of experience

568
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,919
and i don't want you to [ __ ] up and kill

569
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,159
all the dolphins in the ocean because

570
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,520
you decided you could pop this plc

571
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,600
with a script that you found off a

572
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,840
[ __ ] exploit hub yeah

573
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,480
yes there's no gatekeeping there it

574
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:03,360
might be actually a safety issue

575
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,039
right i think it's adding on to that go

576
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,760
back to the go back to the blacksmithing

577
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,919
thing

578
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,440
and i perfect example because there's a

579
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,039
bunch of folks in this industry i have a

580
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,720
ton of respect for because they use

581
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,600
their hands for things other than bloody

582
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,600
keyboards

583
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,520
and i watch how they have honed their

584
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,280
skills over the years

585
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,720
and it's not saying that you can't come

586
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,240
in and you can't do it right and you

587
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,679
can't kick ass and everything else

588
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,440
what it's saying and this is again what

589
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,120
pisses me off about the industry

590
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,799
is you do get people to go out there

591
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,479
with the euro two's experience and on

592
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,400
linkedin they're experts

593
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,919
or on linkedin they they put themselves

594
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,640
at that they start up a company and go

595
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,160
hey i'm a

596
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,720
expert in this and this and this and

597
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,960
this and this now double edged sword

598
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,520
the industry itself especially the

599
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,360
companies in it demand an expert with

600
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,120
five years experience that's just come

601
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:50,320
out of college and all the other [ __ ]

602
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:52,080
for a junior role and it's we have to do

603
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,600
a lot of education in our world

604
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,280
the gatekeeping yeah there's a couple of

605
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,559
people that i would happily take out and

606
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,160
just concrete and put in the

607
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:01,039
bottom of the mariana [ __ ] trends to

608
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,120
be both honest

609
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:05,360
all about that yeah one that actually

610
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:09,439
owns two companies in our industry

611
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:11,439
um and he knows i'm after his throat um

612
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,880
yeah i have no [ __ ] bones about that

613
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,720
let's put it that way

614
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,919
um and i think that's what and again

615
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,120
same thing so again you know somebody

616
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,919
just said hey you can get a degree in

617
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,600
cyber security

618
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,960
i actually don't mind it i like the fact

619
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,480
that you can get a degree in this one i

620
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,240
actually have no problem with that

621
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,360
because at least it means you come out

622
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,640
with some level of freaking

623
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,760
understanding but i don't want you

624
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,760
having that degree

625
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,280
hopefully now demanding a hundred

626
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,879
thousand plus dollars

627
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,799
and then thinking you're a freaking

628
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,679
expert or a superstar that [ __ ] doesn't

629
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,918
work it's

630
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,360
it there is an argument to say you've

631
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:41,200
got to do your time to

632
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,799
actually learn and understand to be more

633
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,240
effective about this

634
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:48,400
yeah yeah you know i i i so so part of

635
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,520
my wishes for our industry right

636
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:54,799
i wish there was a do-over button

637
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:58,320
for us to hit that that had

638
00:19:54,799 --> 00:20:02,000
a a practical amount of experience

639
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:05,360
required for you to be at the bottom

640
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,240
of the industry so and and i mean that

641
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,479
from the you know like i have i i have a

642
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,960
younger sister right my younger sister

643
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,760
is my life i love her i love her to

644
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,799
death

645
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:20,400
and she is she's

646
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:23,039
you know 30 years old right she spent

647
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,880
all this time going to school and then

648
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:27,679
before she was going to go out

649
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,120
to try and you know practice a career in

650
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,760
medicine and all this other stuff she

651
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,879
was like

652
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,879
all right i'm going to get done with my

653
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,000
first part of school and then i'm going

654
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,799
to work in a research

655
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,159
lab because those people have to grind

656
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,559
like you have to actually for

657
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,360
like do real work and the work that you

658
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:44,080
do is

659
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,918
instantly put down to the road of

660
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,639
clinical trials and studies and she was

661
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,440
working on

662
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,080
ms patients and like i can't even i

663
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,919
can't even

664
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:56,240
grasp the idea of thinking about like

665
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,120
i wrote an exploit and it worked or

666
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,840
didn't work

667
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,399
versus like i did lab testing and

668
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,520
someone's

669
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,280
ms is reversing like that's apples and

670
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,360
astronauts different right

671
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,280
so she goes through she spends a bunch

672
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,199
of years doing research science

673
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,639
and then goes back to go to dental

674
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,559
school because she decides look i'm not

675
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,720
gonna go into research science

676
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,840
i'm gonna take the practical application

677
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,600
of what i've learned

678
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,199
working with patients working with

679
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,639
research doing all these things

680
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:28,559
and apply it to dentistry right right

681
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:31,679
she got beat down all over the place

682
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:35,440
because she didn't go right from

683
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:36,640
her school and college directly into

684
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,240
dental school

685
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,080
yeah and then from dental school

686
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,679
directly into something else

687
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,158
yeah because she had some practical

688
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:47,039
world experience now think about

689
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,000
how long it takes you to be a

690
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:51,919
on-the-street

691
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,600
practicing doctor right

692
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,120
i mean it's it's nuts it's like mid-late

693
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,000
twenties before you can actually yeah

694
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,120
wait unless you poke a human right you

695
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,679
could poke a human

696
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,039
when you're like 28 yeah if you like

697
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,760
killed it and skipped a whole bunch of

698
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:07,120
steps

699
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:09,520
yeah and even then you are the like

700
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,320
level one you are not an expert you are

701
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,039
literally

702
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,000
level one and you like by the time you

703
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,240
turn 60

704
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,120
you have progressed to like senior level

705
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,440
doctor

706
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,799
right yeah and and you know some of

707
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,440
those things that i think in our

708
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,280
industry

709
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,039
i think we need to re-look at the

710
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:28,639
industry and figure out

711
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:30,480
how do we start to produce a skill set

712
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,159
in our industry that is sustainable not

713
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,320
for the industry but for actual

714
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,000
for the practitioners you know like one

715
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,600
of the things that makes me most

716
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,799
concerned

717
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,360
about like why we need to talk about

718
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:44,559
business

719
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,120
is that you have this like quick hustle

720
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,840
money

721
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,239
game which is pretty much if i go out

722
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,760
and i

723
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,880
learn a bunch of like hauler level magic

724
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,879
tricks

725
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,480
could i hustle people enough to make a

726
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,720
couple dollars at a bar

727
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,640
that's pretty much the bug bounty game

728
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,640
right like it really is

729
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,480
like could i find some novel way to do

730
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,240
it run it against all these people and

731
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,640
be able to like make some money off of

732
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,240
it

733
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,840
is that going to be a sustainable like

734
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,840
30 40 level

735
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,959
you know career can i can i do that for

736
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,720
40 years

737
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,240
[ __ ] no it's not gonna happen like i

738
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,559
don't i don't give a [ __ ] who you work

739
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,880
for

740
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:20,000
what magical [ __ ] mystical talent

741
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,559
beast you are

742
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,440
like starting off with that and going

743
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,200
right into the

744
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,799
i make a million dollars a year like

745
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,320
cool it was a good trick it's not going

746
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,240
to last forever

747
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,399
and i want people in this industry to

748
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,559
have a sustainable career

749
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,080
so when i when i look at that from a

750
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:39,360
hiring perspective

751
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,158
especially as a ceo and as someone who

752
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,360
started

753
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:44,640
as you know a shitty 28 thousand dollar

754
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,000
network engineer

755
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,080
you know i like i can see where some of

756
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,840
these things in the field we need to

757
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:56,080
maybe back off of this idea of like

758
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,840
you know the cert gets me directly into

759
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,960
a high-paying job

760
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:03,199
right maybe it's uh the cert is

761
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,400
one of the pieces that i need in order

762
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,880
to

763
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,919
gain the level of experience and

764
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:12,320
reliability to to begin a career path

765
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,159
but but why do we why why do we want to

766
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,639
end our career right in the beginning

767
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,480
like

768
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,640
oh i want to go right to being a senior

769
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,880
well then where do you go like you go

770
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,480
yeah you go to your grave pretty much

771
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,000
senior into management at which point

772
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,080
it's like of god so you've

773
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,440
you've kind of traded one i kind of half

774
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,039
ass know about it for another i

775
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,960
half ass know about it right and then we

776
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:33,200
wonder why [ __ ] fails yeah

777
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,640
it's um i think the other thing to add

778
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,720
on to this one and actually healthcare

779
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,840
is a really really freaking good one

780
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,440
um because again same thing i spend

781
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,879
my years of college i spend my years of

782
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,600
school i go to university i get a

783
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,279
pre-med

784
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,959
i go do this i go do that and all of a

785
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:48,159
sudden mid late 20s i get to be able to

786
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,600
poke somebody

787
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,120
and i'm only allowed to do it then

788
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,719
because there's so many freaking drugs

789
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,840
and so much [ __ ] and so many things i

790
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,919
could do to somebody

791
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,678
that isn't right and i've had to learn

792
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,600
as much as i can

793
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,559
what we now have in our industry if you

794
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,240
really really think about it and let's

795
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,120
face it the news in the last 48 hours

796
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,840
pointed it out

797
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,439
bluntly to us but for all these years

798
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,918
leading up to this now if we got [ __ ]

799
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,840
wrong

800
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,600
you broke a computer well you know

801
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,720
reboot you'll be fine that kind of crazy

802
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,559
[ __ ]

803
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,480
we've now we have been for a number of

804
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,600
years but it's now really starting to

805
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,679
come to light

806
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,199
that when we get [ __ ] wrong people are

807
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,960
going to die

808
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,720
and i think for me it's like okay so

809
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,520
you're going to let somebody come out of

810
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,640
a 16 week or a 30 week training course

811
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,080
and don't get me wrong i think the

812
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,360
training courses are [ __ ] great i

813
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,879
have zero problem with because not

814
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,399
everybody likes certain though

815
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,840
give me alternatives to come in

816
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,440
apprenticeships but you're going to let

817
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,199
somebody come out of a 16 week training

818
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,679
course and go straight into

819
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,559
an organization or a position where they

820
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,559
could literally

821
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:46,240
run a scanner in a healthcare facility

822
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:49,360
and do that to somebody

823
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,360
that i have a problem with

824
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,520
yeah and and that's and especially now

825
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,480
you take it another step further it's

826
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,000
like okay

827
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,600
you go to where we're going with the

828
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,120
embedded technology you go to where

829
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,320
we're going with all the tech that we're

830
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,600
engaging in ourselves

831
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:05,120
our homes our lives we have we can't

832
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,799
keep up with all that [ __ ] let's just be

833
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,959
perfectly honest on this one

834
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:10,720
so now we're introducing more people

835
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,840
with less time and less skills and by

836
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,360
the way some of them are like

837
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,678
i'm gonna go do this i'm gonna go start

838
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:18,158
my own company and i'm like okay you

839
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:20,880
gotta take a step back

840
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,360
get off of your own take a step back and

841
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,039
go look

842
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,479
really where am i this is again the

843
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,279
apprenticeship thing for me it's like

844
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,360
okay

845
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,960
who and how can we bring people into

846
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,080
this industry more effectively and get

847
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,679
back together over

848
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,960
back to the diversity thing i think

849
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,919
that's the other part of it i want as

850
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,279
well

851
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:38,799
but um we can't hit the reset button

852
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,240
unfortunately not at the moment it's

853
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,600
just how do we manage it at this point

854
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,000
forward

855
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,600
yeah and and i think the diversity thing

856
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,120
is is important

857
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,320
um you know for for my for my own

858
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:53,439
experience right

859
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,960
um i i can tell you that that while we

860
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,000
have run

861
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:01,200
uh a company that i am quite proud of

862
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:05,279
that i'm i'm i've bled a hell of a lot

863
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:08,240
over um the real the real revolution

864
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:09,679
and and i can i can see it as as openly

865
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,880
and honestly as possible

866
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:16,080
the the real revolution in our business

867
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:18,840
um of where we changed from

868
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,240
just being what i would call a lifestyle

869
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:24,158
business um

870
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:27,120
to to truly expanding and formalizing

871
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,960
what we do and how we do it and plans

872
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,158
you know not just going all right we're

873
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,679
going to hit these numbers we're going

874
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,360
to hit this level of ebitda

875
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,799
by hitting this level of ebitda i'm

876
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,559
going to be able to invest in this and

877
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,279
do this right like that's basic business

878
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:40,480
[ __ ]

879
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:42,720
um the real revolution for us in

880
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,159
growth and expansion and all of those

881
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,440
things probably

882
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:50,159
didn't even come till the last maybe

883
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,840
four years five years out of 12 minutes

884
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:54,399
you know 12 13 years of business

885
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,520
and and i can tell you largely it was

886
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:58,959
kicked off

887
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:02,240
by us looking at the business

888
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:04,480
moving from the idea of you know

889
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,320
all right we're you know we can we can

890
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,320
do all of the things right like

891
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,720
like like oh yeah sure i can do

892
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,840
everything from accounting to running

893
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,159
quickbooks to

894
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,520
running sales calls to doing engineering

895
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,640
work and all this

896
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,840
all this [ __ ] um to to really starting

897
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,039
to go all right

898
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:25,199
i need to be able to rely on the people

899
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,960
that are often behind the scenes and

900
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,559
then understanding that they're truly

901
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,720
the foundation of the business that

902
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:32,720
yeah that the stuff that we were doing

903
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,640
was almost like the end

904
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,559
of the process not the beginning of the

905
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,440
process it was literally the end

906
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:40,720
and to your to your exact point

907
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,960
diversity

908
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,120
is one of those things that changed our

909
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:48,159
business permanently right like

910
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:51,120
you know my my team

911
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:52,320
um i'll go to bat for them any day and

912
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,918
at the same time

913
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,520
i'll take the pepsi challenge against

914
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:58,159
any [ __ ] person or

915
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:00,240
company in the industry that you know my

916
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:02,000
head of sales can probably out hack

917
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,240
some of the best people that are the

918
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:08,080
seniors on most other teams

919
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:11,679
and oh yeah yeah it's a woman and

920
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:14,080
who runs the money another woman yeah

921
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:15,760
who who runs our project management it

922
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,080
sure as [ __ ] isn't a guy

923
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,200
yeah because i know how disorganized

924
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,399
most men are

925
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,120
you know like same thing jen jen looks

926
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:26,158
after me

927
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,760
i could not function and when

928
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,520
when she came in i'm like i can't

929
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,559
function she just looked at me i'm like

930
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,120
i'm really obvious oh yeah exactly i'm

931
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:35,520
like

932
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,279
i can't do this there's not enough hours

933
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,440
in the day to make things

934
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,640
work and i mean again this is this goes

935
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,520
back to the business thing it's like

936
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,919
okay

937
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,600
you have to do all of your work in less

938
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,360
time than you had before

939
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,879
and by the way you still have to go out

940
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,719
there and hunt and kill

941
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,679
um good oh by the way you're still going

942
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,559
to live you're still going to live

943
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,679
you're still going to pay bills you

944
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,879
still got to pay everybody else saying

945
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:57,520
you balance the accounts you gotta

946
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,520
balance the books

947
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,240
right this [ __ ] just [ __ ] it this

948
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:03,120
doesn't work jen came in she's like i

949
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,440
got you covered

950
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,399
she's she's organizing conferences for

951
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,320
me at the moment it's

952
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,918
scary as hell i'd forgotten how much

953
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,600
stuff i've actually committed to

954
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:13,120
she's looking at me like why are they

955
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,480
not paying for this she's like this is a

956
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:18,158
revenue stream like

957
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,200
i'm sorry i don't know anything about

958
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,200
that i'm just going to the super

959
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,640
conference

960
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,480
she's got a better business head than i

961
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,360
have and she's freaking amazing and she

962
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,120
i mean it's

963
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,360
again what i love about it it's an

964
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:32,080
entirely different set of thoughts

965
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,439
and it also takes us i think that's the

966
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,639
other part of it as well

967
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:38,320
it takes us realizing that we

968
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,919
can't do it all and i think that's

969
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,200
something a lot of us are i know i

970
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,120
wasn't good at that for a while i'm

971
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,039
still not good in some areas

972
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,879
um it's like jake i got jake running

973
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:49,360
with me now he's doing a bunch of the

974
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,000
assessment stuff i have now got to a

975
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,360
comfort level

976
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,960
with him where i can just hand it off

977
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,918
and what i get back to look at from a

978
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,880
report

979
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:58,799
maybe takes me half an hour and i'm like

980
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,960
yes

981
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:02,559
rather than three hours of rewriting and

982
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,519
rewording and [ __ ] like that he's got

983
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:05,760
his [ __ ] together

984
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:07,440
he's articulate and it's finding the

985
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:10,080
right people it's training the right

986
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,159
people it's helping them understand

987
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,519
why we do it the way we do it why to do

988
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:15,519
it the right way rather than just

989
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,559
throwing [ __ ] over the fence and hoping

990
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:19,840
some of it sticks

991
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:23,360
yeah well i mean look in in in the same

992
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:26,480
spirit of of diversity i think

993
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:30,559
you know the the right way air quotes

994
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:33,679
um is is something that is subject to

995
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:34,240
to perception and and without having

996
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:37,519
people

997
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:40,399
on the team that can have

998
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:42,640
not only a level of humility but remove

999
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:44,879
some of their hubris and be able

1000
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,320
to accept somebody else's opinion

1001
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:50,399
regardless of

1002
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:52,320
how rough it may be that that creates

1003
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:53,760
the right way for many different

1004
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:57,200
situations because

1005
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:59,600
whether you're a certain orientation

1006
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:02,080
or you have a certain belief system or

1007
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,240
you're a certain gender or whatever else

1008
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,879
by by mixing those things together you

1009
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:09,039
get more right ways right like you can

1010
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,440
you can pick and choose from the people

1011
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:14,158
on the team who have a relation

1012
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,440
to that business or to that customer or

1013
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:17,519
to that person

1014
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,760
and you can say look i'm i might be the

1015
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:22,080
person who's on the call right now

1016
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:24,080
but in order for this to land correctly

1017
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,760
like i i need to understand

1018
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,960
where these different aspects come from

1019
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,879
so i think the more that you can

1020
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,519
diversify the team the more that you

1021
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,360
have

1022
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,799
the ability to get multiple people's

1023
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,760
levels of input

1024
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,639
the better off you are i i caveat that

1025
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,760
though

1026
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:42,320
with there is a certain amount of

1027
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:46,000
diversity that happens

1028
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:49,120
because it was required and

1029
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,799
that diversity requirement

1030
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,879
is something where i feel like people

1031
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:55,440
don't absorb it as well right like

1032
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,720
i am a person who i want to learn about

1033
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,559
all these people's

1034
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,919
you know crazy stuff that doesn't make

1035
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:02,559
any sense to me like

1036
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:04,399
okay cool you believe in you know wild

1037
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:06,559
couch spirits like awesome

1038
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:08,639
tell me more about that like eventually

1039
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:10,080
i will be able to learn more about it so

1040
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:13,120
if i meet somebody else who's down

1041
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:15,439
with you know the crazy couch gods like

1042
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,639
i'm like i've heard about that before

1043
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,640
that sounds neat

1044
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,720
but but i think that you know some

1045
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,640
sometimes which is also probably not

1046
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,919
politically correct or cool to say

1047
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,640
that the you know required diversity

1048
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,480
pieces

1049
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,080
they like phone it in right like they're

1050
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,919
like oh well i just i just ticked the

1051
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,320
box and i hired this many people of this

1052
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:34,960
color

1053
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,678
and gender yeah style and all this stuff

1054
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,519
and

1055
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,279
and they don't get the benefit of

1056
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:40,480
actually having that diverse culture

1057
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:42,080
because they're so big

1058
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,880
it's like the [ __ ] difference between

1059
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:48,480
compliance and security i knew that was

1060
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,480
going to come up right i'm like yes

1061
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,840
you're either doing it because you want

1062
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:53,600
it or you're doing it because you have

1063
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,879
to but [ __ ] i'd rather people do it

1064
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,360
because they want it

1065
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,080
right and so this to me goes this is to

1066
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,639
the heart

1067
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,320
of some of the reasons why i think

1068
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,600
building your own company is a good

1069
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,760
thing the good [ __ ]

1070
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,879
you get to have those choices you get to

1071
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,320
make him yourself you

1072
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:11,520
i do i love hanging out um i hang out

1073
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,159
there's a podcast

1074
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,759
every through wednesday afternoon it's

1075
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,320
called bridges in tech

1076
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:20,320
and it's freaking brilliant i just love

1077
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,919
it because there's so much diversity

1078
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,919
i'm kidnapping people from there to go

1079
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:24,560
hey do you want to go work over here can

1080
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:26,239

1081
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,759
can i can we bo can i borrow you for

1082
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,239
some of this i freaking love it it's

1083
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,760
like

1084
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:32,638
it's like a talent pool that i can be

1085
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,919
like hey this is amazing from this one

1086
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,919
yet people sit and go well i don't know

1087
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:37,679
how not unaware to me it's like okay

1088
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:40,078
what i do love about doing the company

1089
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:42,800
thing is the ability to effect

1090
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:44,159
change personally rather than fighting

1091
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,919
against a system that

1092
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,560
to your point is just like we got the

1093
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:49,759
token black person yes uh

1094
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,119
they're sitting in the office over there

1095
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,919
we don't really know what to do with

1096
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,240
them but

1097
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:55,279
we've got the token yeah but we've we

1098
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,638
found a laser they're here

1099

and um they're they're over there in

1100
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,960

1101
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,078
you know

1102
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:04,160
it's stupid yeah i uh

1103
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,440
i you know i was i was just i'm sitting

1104
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,359
looking through

1105
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,720
through no the the not asking us

1106
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:10,560
questions but still like

1107
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,759
listening everybody's doing it i'm

1108
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,920
actually gonna hit that i'm hitting the

1109
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:17,359
next one so we're gonna

1110
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:21,200
yeah this is my day sometimes

1111
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:24,880
[ __ ] yeah um i i'm i'm gonna end

1112
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:28,040
i'm gonna end the good with you know

1113
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:30,000
on that piece of of diversity and

1114
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:32,880
institutionalizing knowledge and being

1115
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,960
able to have certain levels of freedom

1116
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:39,520
um

1117
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:42,720
that freedom is a double-edged sword

1118
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:46,400
yeah it um i i am

1119
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:49,759
positive mr roberts could tell you about

1120
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:51,760
what it looks like when you think

1121
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,680
you are free because you are the owner

1122
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,560
of a company

1123
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:58,240
but in turn you are not really free

1124
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:01,040
because there is a community

1125
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,598
of people out there who truly want to do

1126
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,480
nothing

1127
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:06,160
but light you on fire because they don't

1128
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,880
feel like they're free

1129
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,480
right well there's that okay so let's

1130
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,440
hit that one in a second because to me

1131
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,359
that can get that

1132
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,359
that actually goes to our oregon trail

1133
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:16,640
one that's oregon trail that's oregon

1134
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,560
trail time

1135
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:21,040
here's what i love about this one so you

1136
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,320
work inside an organization you work for

1137
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,240
you know you work for the man or the

1138
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,480
woman take your pick on this one

1139
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,439
you work for the organization you have

1140
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,240
one boss

1141
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,920
maybe you have a dotted line to

1142
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,279
somewhere else you know it's like oh i

1143
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,839
got two bosses that i don't know

1144
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,440
it sucks okay you know you don't know

1145
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:39,520
how lucky you are i'm looking at the

1146
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,640
stuff i'm doing i think i'm an advisor

1147
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,640
for

1148
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:44,640
there's like 12 or 14 companies at the

1149
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,359
moment and i'm also doing a bunch of

1150
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,839
other stuff

1151
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:49,839
i have and you're in the same boat i

1152
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:52,880
have 14 to 16

1153
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:54,880
bosses at any one point

1154
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,000
in time and that doesn't count the

1155
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,200
bosses at home

1156
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,920
kids and dogs and all the other totally

1157
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:03,439
relevant

1158
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:05,040
all the way bosses the dog being the one

1159
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,640
so again you know typical bloody thing

1160
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,920
the dog number one he'll come and wander

1161
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,200
over every now and again see what i'm up

1162
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,240
to and stick his head in the conference

1163
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,919
which i love

1164
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,040
but other people do too but at four

1165
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,320
o'clock in the morning when you're

1166
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,440
actually trying to break [ __ ] or do

1167
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,240
something it's like

1168
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,560
uh so we're awake can we go play okay

1169
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,680
and

1170
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:22,000
there is no when that when a 195 pound

1171
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,560
great

1172
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,040
dane decides that they want to play

1173
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,240
you're

1174
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:31,040
not going to be able to say no

1175
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:32,000
yeah yeah the same goes when they have

1176
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,320
to [ __ ]

1177
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,240
you know don't really have an option to

1178
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,839
be like hey hold on a second be like

1179
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,919
oh that's cool i'm just going to take

1180
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:42,640
care of it right here

1181
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,640
and then you have to realize that like

1182
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:47,200
in that moment of extreme

1183
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,640
error of judgment where you have decided

1184
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,640
to put your needs

1185
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:52,480
beyond the needs of the people around

1186
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:55,680
you you

1187
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:58,240
then have a whole big opportunity

1188
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,759
to figure out what solvents work how

1189
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,319
long it's going to take

1190
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,280
how you remove that bad decision from

1191
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,160
your life

1192
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,359
at what at what time this will happen

1193
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,359
you get to remember

1194
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:11,200
that bad decision for the rest of your

1195
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:12,078
hacking session because it's six o'clock

1196
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,799
in the morning

1197
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:18,480
all you smell is that one cleanup event

1198
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:22,320
that continues to exist in your life

1199
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:24,240
oh we um this past year

1200
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,240
and this is exactly almost exactly the

1201
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,160
reason for this so this past year

1202
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,279
beginning of the year we totally redid

1203
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,078
the landscaping in the back of the

1204
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,079
garden

1205
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:34,079
we took out all the grass and we put in

1206
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:35,680
basically astro turf and we put in the

1207
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,440
good stuff the high quality stuff that

1208
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,879
looks like colorado grass

1209
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,400
all that other [ __ ] and the reason we

1210
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,359
did that is because again you know three

1211
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,640
o'clock in the morning

1212
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:44,960
in the middle of the winter when you're

1213
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:46,000
down here typing one of the big dogs

1214
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,160
comes in

1215
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,320
at yeah and they've been outside in the

1216
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,920
snow or the mud and they've traced in

1217
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,359
through the kitchen in through the house

1218
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,960
all the way through the great room and

1219
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:56,319
dances down the stairs they come up to

1220
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,880
you they've got a nice muddy nose

1221
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,160
because they

1222
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,880
dug because it's cool and then you're

1223
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,399
like

1224
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:06,320
guys i hate to interrupt but um we have

1225
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,920
several questions or several people have

1226
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,560
asked a question about something that mr

1227
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:12,240
nickerson said earlier

1228
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,078
uh and it had to do with the impression

1229
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,720
you gave that sexism

1230
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:18,079
and racism were being used as crutches

1231
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,078
and victimhood

1232
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:21,520
yeah can you clarify that please i

1233
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:25,440
absolutely will

1234
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:28,240
there are a a large number

1235
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,280
of of opinions that exist in the

1236
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,000
industry

1237
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,119
and and this is in every single industry

1238
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,880
now when you say

1239
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:36,800
stereotype the reason that the word

1240
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,880
stereotype exists is because that means

1241
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:41,040
it's the majority doesn't mean that it's

1242
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,520
every single person right

1243
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:45,119
so this same thing exists in our

1244
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,839
industry where we have

1245
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:49,520
a large number of people who have truly

1246
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:50,640
gone through the experience who have

1247
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,640
truly said

1248
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,839
you can't climb the ladder because you

1249
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,480
are x because you're

1250
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:58,480
this gender this race this uh you know

1251
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,760
religion the sexual orientation all of

1252
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:03,520
that stuff right

1253
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:06,560
i said very clearly before that happens

1254
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:09,599
but there is also a sect

1255
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:11,440
of people who are using that as a crutch

1256
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:13,119
and we have to be able to distinct

1257
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,760
between the two right

1258
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:17,440
there is there is a very poignant

1259
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,000
problem that we need to address

1260
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,280
i feel that we have been trying to

1261
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,720
correct that over time

1262
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:25,839
and we've been accelerating that

1263
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:27,839
correction but we cannot ignore

1264
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:29,680
the people that are giving the ones who

1265
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:32,160
have actually gone through bad [ __ ]

1266
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:33,520
a bad name by just co-opting their

1267
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,480
experience

1268
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:38,000
and and and i'm i'm more than happy to

1269
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,560
continue that

1270
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,400
kind of dichotomous ex you know

1271
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,720
discussion on both sides

1272
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,560
but there is a huge difference between

1273
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,520
somebody who has not been afforded the

1274
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,680
opportunity

1275
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,880
and somebody who had has been afforded

1276
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,759
the opportunity

1277
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:55,200
and has used it as a crutch and said oh

1278
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,079
well i'm not getting

1279
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:59,598
to in the context of that comment was

1280
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:01,280
i'm not getting the hundred thousand

1281
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:04,720
dollar job a year

1282
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:06,000
because i'm this sexual orientation or

1283
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,879
because i'm this gender

1284
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,640
or because i believe in this you know

1285
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,800
space boogie man in the sky

1286
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,759
versus in the ground versus in my soul

1287
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,680
versus in the

1288
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:21,440
you know ethos and at the same time

1289
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:23,279
said person only has you know 16 weeks

1290
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,680
of experience from a certain

1291
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,720
academy that gave them a paper paper

1292
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,839
tiger shirt

1293
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:31,680
now there's a big difference between the

1294
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:32,480
person who has worked their ass off for

1295
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,720
20 years

1296
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,760
and has been [ __ ] on by the industry and

1297
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,480
really needs

1298
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,680
to have the expect and and the respect

1299
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,760
that they deserve

1300
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:44,160
because they put in the time versus the

1301
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:46,160
person who went out and got a paper cert

1302
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:48,078
and wants to start bitching about you

1303
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,920
know how the industry doesn't treat them

1304
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:51,440
right and there's all these gatekeepers

1305
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,720
when they don't even have the experience

1306
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,720
to exist at level one

1307
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,920
there's no responses from the crowd

1308
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,160
which is great i think you know i'm

1309
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:04,240
actually gonna i'm

1310
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,359
oh hey do you mind if i add a little bit

1311
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,439
onto this please

1312
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:09,200
go ahead i was just gonna ask mr

1313
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,560
nickerson

1314
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,399
what percentage of people do you think

1315
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:14,799
are on either side of that

1316
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,440
i don't i don't have a stat right i know

1317
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,839
but

1318
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,280
but i think that the realization that

1319
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:22,000
has to exist

1320
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,599
is that there are two sides there is no

1321
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,960
one-sided coin

1322
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:30,160
and and we have to be able to evaluate

1323
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:31,119
based on experience based on you know

1324
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:34,240
what people

1325
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:37,440
can and can't contribute and be able

1326
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:39,520
to recognize where their value is and

1327
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,040
and also back to the whole blacksmithing

1328
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:43,200
thing be able to say

1329
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:45,359
look you might not be really really good

1330
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,200
at making knives but you could be really

1331
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:49,680
really good at making

1332
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:51,200
something else with this same material

1333
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:54,720
and and so

1334
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:57,680
i think on us it's not just an issue of

1335
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:59,759
blanketly saying oh well no one gets an

1336
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:01,919
opportunity because of xyz

1337
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,200
i think that we have to be able to go

1338
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,280
back into that

1339
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:07,598
and be able to objectively look at it

1340
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,400
and be able to to kind of be the third

1341
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:10,240
party

1342
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,240
that that all of us wish that we could

1343
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:15,598
be in the world and say

1344
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:18,720
is this truly a problem of of

1345
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:20,640
opportunity and and recognize how we

1346
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,160
have to give people more opportunity and

1347
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,720
be able to do that in a more effective

1348
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,359
way

1349
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:27,200
or is this a problem of evaluation where

1350
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:30,000
we now have to guide this person to say

1351
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,359
look i i get that you might feel that

1352
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,079
this is the reason that you're being

1353
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:35,279
held down

1354
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:37,680
but the the the raw fact

1355
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,960
is you only took one day worth of

1356
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,879
blacksmithing and you need

1357
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,960
15 years in order to be considered a

1358
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:45,680
master blacksmith now whether you want

1359
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:48,480
to be able to accept that or not

1360
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:50,160
it is what it is and and i and i think

1361
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,280
that that's that's my distinction

1362
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,680
between those two

1363
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:55,040
there are people on both sides there are

1364
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,879
people that have been

1365
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,560
absolutely [ __ ] on throughout their

1366
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,440
career you know what i can

1367
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:03,759
i can give every piece of like what what

1368
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,920
privileges i've had and whatever else

1369
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,599
but have i gone through a large part of

1370
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:10,560
my career where i was [ __ ] on

1371
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:12,160
because of my age yeah hell yeah did i

1372
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,119
know more than the people that i was

1373
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,520
working for

1374
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:17,839
[ __ ] yeah i was a better engineer than

1375
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:20,160
almost anyone else on that team

1376
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:21,119
and i was making 20 grand a year and

1377
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,359
when i went

1378
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:25,440
and i went up to management and i said

1379
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:26,799
what do i have to do to make the 80

1380
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,240
grand that these people made

1381
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,880
they were like oh we'll go get these

1382
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,680
certs i literally went out and got an

1383
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:35,119
mcse

1384
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:38,799
i got a ccna and a ccda

1385
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:40,560
in three weeks and i brought it back up

1386
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,319
and then the [ __ ] head of the

1387
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:45,520
department ducked me

1388
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:49,119
continued to duck me until my boss

1389
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:50,720
who was a i mean sherwood archibald

1390
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:53,359
is probably one of the most influential

1391
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:54,240
man in in my life with the exception of

1392
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:56,078
of my

1393
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,439
my stepdad who i call my dad larry

1394
00:44:56,079 --> 00:45:01,119
o'brien he is one of those

1395
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:04,079
influential men in my entire life as a

1396
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:04,880
you know 50 something year old at the

1397
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:08,480
time

1398
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:10,319
black mp who worked and and was a

1399
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:13,839
30-year vet

1400
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:15,599
came up to me and said you will not get

1401
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:18,480
anywhere in this company

1402
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:19,599
you have to leave yeah and that's that

1403
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,480
moment to me

1404
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:23,920
where my age the ageism that was going

1405
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,680
on in my career

1406
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,200
was something that the person above me

1407
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:29,919
had to realize

1408
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:31,439
was it something that they could fix was

1409
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,240
it something they could offer a new

1410
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,280
opportunity

1411
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:37,439
to or was their responsibility you have

1412
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,560
to leave because the culture's not going

1413
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,280
to accept you

1414
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:42,000
and you have to fly on and and that's

1415
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,720
something

1416
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,280
that i have experienced even being a man

1417
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,680
of

1418
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:49,200
whatever skin color privilege or sexual

1419
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:50,879
orientation privilege or whatever the

1420
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:53,598
[ __ ] privilege that i have

1421
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,560
right all of us go through hard [ __ ] my

1422
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:58,800
comment to that

1423
00:45:54,560 --> 00:46:01,359
is as a business owner as a manager

1424
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:03,680
as a peer we have to all be able to

1425
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:06,000
recognize what are the confines of our

1426
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,118
of of our particular company and

1427
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,520
organization

1428
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:11,119
and be able to evaluate is this

1429
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,720
something that's resolvable

1430
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:14,560
is it something where we could open up

1431
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:16,399
the door of opportunity or

1432
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,680
is this something where this person's so

1433
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,960
good that the company doesn't even

1434
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,720
[ __ ] deserve them

1435
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,560
and it's time for us to help them move

1436
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:27,439
on to a company that does deserve the

1437
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:27,440
talent that they have

1438
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:35,759
no i'm not i i i'm i'm actually thinking

1439
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,200
back to some of the [ __ ] i went through

1440
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,440
years ago on that one

1441
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,720
i'm also thinking forward at the moment

1442
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,160
because again same thing i remember

1443
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:44,319
working in an organization

1444
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:46,319
um before i went in the military same

1445
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:46,800
thing remember working in the company i

1446
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:49,680
was

1447
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:51,760
freaking 16 17 years old and i remember

1448
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:53,359
having the conversation i'm teaching the

1449
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,240
people that are earning three times more

1450
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:56,000
than me

1451
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:58,160
how do i change that and the answer was

1452
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,599
pretty much so you don't i'm like well

1453
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:01,759
it's been a pleasure thank you and

1454
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:03,599
goodbye

1455
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:05,920
and you just you know you don't change

1456
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:07,119
that because you're 16 17 you're just

1457
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,800
not no scared

1458
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:10,480
et cetera et cetera et cetera now that

1459
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,440
is one unfortunate to your point i'm

1460
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,040
fortunate

1461
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,560
and i do say unfortunately because i am

1462
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,359
you know let's face it i'm old gray and

1463
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:18,160
white

1464
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:19,839
um but at the same time here's my other

1465
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,240
call out on this one and it's a big one

1466
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:22,400
and this

1467
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,439
comes from some of the stuff that we're

1468
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,599
dealing with at the moment in the

1469
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:28,160
industry where there's a number of

1470
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:29,119
people who are not necessarily being

1471
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:31,279
gatekeeper but it's more on the

1472
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:32,720
gaslighting side of things

1473
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,800
this is where it's going to get really

1474
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,799
kind of gnarly because

1475
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,559
there's a lot of us in here and again

1476
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,880
because we're not working for companies

1477
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:41,839
we

1478
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:43,200
can stand up and say [ __ ] this we need

1479
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:44,558
to change it because we're not being

1480
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:46,480
held down by hr

1481
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:48,480
that says oh you can't get controversial

1482
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:50,079
which is how it's happened in the past

1483
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,839
but the ability now to stand up and go

1484
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:52,880
hey i will be a bullet shield for some

1485
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:54,920
of this as long as

1486
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,720
those people are willing to march

1487
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:58,720
alongside

1488
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:00,799
that's also i'm finding part of the

1489
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,439
problem is that sometimes the people

1490
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,280
that are

1491
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:05,119
having the issues that bring them up

1492
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:07,839
quietly behind the scenes

1493
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:09,359
when we do stand up and say we will have

1494
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:11,200
cover fire for you

1495
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:14,319
we will march with you we will be the

1496
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:15,520
[ __ ] bullet shields for all i care

1497
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:17,839
those people are going to stand up as

1498
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:20,800
well it does take

1499
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:22,240
both parties and that is something i

1500
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:24,240
don't know how to fix the money i think

1501
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,680
part of it is because there is still

1502
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:29,040
concern in the industry there's

1503
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:30,480
retribution valid concern unfortunately

1504
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,520
and that's another thing i don't know

1505
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,720
how to solve it's one of those

1506
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:35,119
frustrating things that's actually

1507
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:36,000
pissing me off on a semi-regular basis

1508
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:38,400
because i see it

1509
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,520
too much i hear about it too much we all

1510
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,280
know that there are people in this

1511
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:42,319
industry that use their influence and

1512
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,480
their power

1513
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:46,558
to demean others to hold others hostage

1514
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:49,200
ransom whatever you want to call it from

1515
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:49,839
images from business and the sexual side

1516
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,919
of it

1517
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:53,359
and that shit's got to end and i don't

1518
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,400
know how to fix that to be perfectly

1519
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:56,720
honest

1520
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:59,680
all right i i hate to interrupt here

1521
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:02,160
again i apologize this is

1522
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:04,240
good this is a conversation if we were

1523
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:07,200
all together we would be able to rap

1524
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:08,078
and people would just walk it out i know

1525
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,319
like i said i just

1526
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:12,319
lose them out i'm tempted to just open

1527
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:13,839
the zoom up to anyone do it open it up

1528
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:15,200
do it i'll kill that senator let me stop

1529
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:17,279
the share

1530
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:18,879
hang on i want to show this one i want

1531
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,599
to show this like the distance light had

1532
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,319
to be shot

1533
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:23,200
you had to show the dysentery slide the

1534
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:24,960
ugly [ __ ]

1535
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,799
this is when this is when your own

1536
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,440
company votes you out of your own

1537
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,559
company

1538
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:31,920
and you piss off the investors and you

1539
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:33,920
do all sorts of other [ __ ] it's happened

1540
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,960
twice now not once but twice well done

1541
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:38,319
me all right

1542
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:39,920
so yeah all right end of slides yes

1543
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:41,839
all right it had to be dysentery all

1544
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:44,640
right i'm back all right let me see

1545
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:45,359
let me see if i can do this um so what i

1546
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,879
was asking

1547
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:50,160
when i asked that we've said that we

1548
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:53,599
should throw the zoom open

1549
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:56,319
regarding the gatekeeping and the sexism

1550
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:58,240
and the harassment that goes on is that

1551
00:49:56,319 --> 00:50:00,240
a matter of people being unpleasant or

1552
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:03,040
is it a matter of people being

1553
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:04,160
unself-aware because if i if i look

1554
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:07,279
backwards

1555
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:08,799
yeah if i look back over my

1556
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:10,720
and i'm not really an infosec never

1557
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:13,839
really have been i'm just

1558
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:16,558
a pretty decent cis admin

1559
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:20,160
um pretty decent [ __ ] yeah i was

1560
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:22,960
going to say you're an infant suck it up

1561
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:24,240
what blue tea i don't even know um

1562
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:26,559
you're right

1563
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:28,479
you're part of us your family and the

1564
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:30,559
discussion that's all we need to like

1565
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,760
all right thanks um i've done some

1566
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:34,960
horrible stuff

1567
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:37,920
i mean i i i look back if

1568
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:40,640
absolutely horrible stuff and i still

1569
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:43,440
have some deeply ingrained racism

1570
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:45,598
yep and some deeply ingrained sexism so

1571
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:48,079
how i mean i am aware of it at least

1572
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:49,760
yeah and it's still subconsciously i'll

1573
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:51,839
catch myself thinking something

1574
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:53,520
[ __ ] happens yeah i grew up in a

1575
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:56,640
household my father

1576
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:57,920
my father was british military and at

1577
00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:00,078
one point i think he was

1578
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,920
relatively okay but then he got dragged

1579
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:03,280
into the live age stuff and he went over

1580
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,760
to africa did a bunch of stuff over

1581
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,839
there

1582
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:07,280
saw the individuals over there and what

1583
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:08,400
they did to each other and now as far as

1584
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,359
he was concerned was it

1585
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,960
definitely wouldn't happen to the

1586
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:11,839
english people i'm like yeah actually

1587
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,359
probably would

1588
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:15,759
take food away be amazed at what one

1589
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:17,440
human will do to another at that point i

1590
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:19,599
lived in a racist household

1591
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,119
and believe from my father's side my

1592
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:22,319
mother absolutely not but my father was

1593
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:24,960
definitely that way

1594
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:26,160
so i i'm fortunate i grew up in various

1595
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,079
parts of the world so for me

1596
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:29,598
i didn't even really think about color

1597
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:30,880
until i got over here

1598
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:32,079
and the first interaction i had with

1599
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,599
somebody was like let me introduce you

1600
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:35,119
to my black friend i'm like

1601
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:36,800
you categorize your [ __ ] friends by

1602
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:38,960
the skin color

1603
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,400
you have a second voice you have that

1604
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,760
voice at the back of your head perfect

1605
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,319
example i did this on linkedin the other

1606
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,440
day

1607
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:47,200
i put a picture of basically black guy

1608
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:49,359
running like this that guy running along

1609
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:50,879
on the side i'm like what is your very

1610
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:54,160
first impression

1611
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:56,160
is it oh nice guy out for a jog yeah

1612
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:58,000
exactly is it nice guy for a jog or is

1613
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:00,319
it what just happened

1614
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,839
if it's that latter one that's okay

1615
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:05,520
perfectly acceptable

1616
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:05,920
but that second voice should be sitting

1617
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,800
there

1618
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:11,280
arguing against you before you open your

1619
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:13,920
bloody mouth and say the stupid [ __ ]

1620
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:14,480
yeah that's how i look at it yeah i mean

1621
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:18,800
i

1622
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:22,400
i agree that there is

1623
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:26,240
such a rampant problem

1624
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:28,880
with people's lack of evolution

1625
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:29,359
um that that that to me is where that

1626
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,960
exists

1627
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:37,440
right like like having a

1628
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:40,720
a gay uncle who died of aids in the 90s

1629
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:44,079
gave me a different perspective of

1630
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:45,200
how people needed to accept or not

1631
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:46,960
accept

1632
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:48,319
the the [ __ ] that other people do now

1633
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:51,599
whether it's skin

1634
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:52,640
color creed you know religion who you

1635
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:56,240
[ __ ] whatever

1636
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:58,000
um like like it it gave me a different

1637
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:00,160
opinion of that and it was just because

1638
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:03,520
i had to i had to see it right like

1639
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:04,720
like i was i was the kid with two guys

1640
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:07,119
walking down the street

1641
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:08,799
who you know when i was young had had to

1642
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:09,760
listen to the [ __ ] that people would

1643
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:12,480
say

1644
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:13,520
and and it was always confusing to me

1645
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:16,800
but

1646
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:18,240
i i don't think that that there's this

1647
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:21,280
like

1648
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:23,359
universal you know it happens for

1649
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,760
everything like i think we also need to

1650
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:26,839
give

1651
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:28,400
people some space to evolve i think

1652
00:53:26,839 --> 00:53:31,599
sometimes uh

1653
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:32,640
people get held so accountable for their

1654
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:35,440
past

1655
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:36,960
that we forget that we were all stupid

1656
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:39,440
kids we forget that we did

1657
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:41,119
dumb [ __ ] that was illegal or not legal

1658
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:42,640
or

1659
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:44,640
whatever whatever it's supposed to be

1660
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:46,480
called right and

1661
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:48,319
and and i think that that goes with our

1662
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:50,319
evolution of language over time i think

1663
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:52,319
it goes with our evolution of self

1664
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:53,680
our evolution of awareness our evolution

1665
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:56,558
of other people

1666
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:58,319
like you know i mean i i went i went to

1667
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:00,079
furry cons because i thought it was fun

1668
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:02,000
because like those people were mad cool

1669
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:03,920
like it was like they did neat [ __ ] they

1670
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:07,359
made like really awesome costumes

1671
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:09,359
and then like i started to hear about

1672
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:10,799
the other people who were slamming them

1673
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:12,240
because they were like oh

1674
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:14,480
it's just a conference that you go to

1675
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:16,078
and you dress up in like mascot uniforms

1676
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,359
and like had sex with a bunch of people

1677
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:19,200
and i was like

1678
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:20,480
how come i missed that party because

1679
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:22,160
like i was

1680
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:24,000
i was i was like looking at all the cool

1681
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:26,720
art and like all the other things

1682
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,839
but but you know my my point to that is

1683
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:30,399
that

1684
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:32,240
i feel like we need to be able to give

1685
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:34,960
ourselves permission to evolve

1686
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:35,359
and permission to evolve sometimes mean

1687
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:38,960
means

1688
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:40,880
accepting that that where we grew up and

1689
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,799
how we grew up had a certain amount of

1690
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:43,760
language and association and things like

1691
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:46,559
that to it

1692
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:48,079
where it might be hard like look my

1693
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:51,520
grandmother

1694
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:54,079
was was not a racist person now did she

1695
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:55,920
say some like racist sounding [ __ ]

1696
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:57,280
well yeah because they used words like

1697
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:59,440
that back then and that was like the

1698
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:02,480
language and vernacular that she used

1699
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:04,480
but at the same time on you know three

1700
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:07,599
days before she passed

1701
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:08,480
did she look at the two black dudes that

1702
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:10,480
picked her up

1703
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:11,839
and carried her from one bed to another

1704
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:14,160
bed and like

1705
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:15,520
touch his arm and be like yeah i'll let

1706
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:18,480
you move me to bed

1707
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:19,920
okay well guess what you know like she

1708
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:22,319
might have said the n-word a couple

1709
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:25,119
times in her life but at the same time

1710
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:25,599
she was definitely an old man or an old

1711
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:28,160
woman

1712
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:29,359
on her bed hitting on black dudes

1713
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:31,680
actively

1714
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:33,440
like there's a big [ __ ] difference

1715
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,000
between how you act in the [ __ ] that you

1716
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,079
say and i

1717
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,880
think that while while it's going to

1718
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:40,799
take all of us a long time to be able to

1719
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:43,520
get to the neutral language

1720
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:45,280
that allows us to associate and work

1721
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:47,359
with everyone respectively

1722
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:48,960
we still have to look at the actions of

1723
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:50,640
people we have to look at like

1724
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:52,160
okay there's there might be a real big

1725
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:54,160
difference between the word that you

1726
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:55,200
used instead of you calling me the wrong

1727
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:58,078
pronoun

1728
00:55:55,200 --> 00:56:00,240
and immediately jumping to like you

1729
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:02,000
[ __ ] hate trans people to like

1730
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:04,319
maybe you just suck at it because the

1731
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,720
day that i met you you used to be called

1732
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:07,680
she

1733
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:08,879
now you're called it or whatever robot

1734
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:11,359
that you decided to

1735
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:13,440
be called and i just suck at it because

1736
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:14,880
i had like nine years of calling you one

1737
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:16,640
thing and i've had one year of calling

1738
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:18,319
you the new thing and like i'm just

1739
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:19,680
gonna [ __ ] up because i'm human

1740
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:21,279
that doesn't that doesn't mean that i'm

1741
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,319
a piece of [ __ ] it just means that like

1742
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:24,240
you gotta give me a little bit of

1743
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:27,279
permission to evolve

1744
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:27,759
imagine imagine parents whose kids um i

1745
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:30,240
was just

1746
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,960
gonna say i don't have kids so i can't

1747
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:33,040
imagine it but

1748
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:34,160
[ __ ] it would be hard let me take that

1749
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:37,599
one step further

1750
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:39,359
so i have two daughters

1751
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:41,440
one of my daughters has now decided to

1752
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:43,200
be going no by non-binary so

1753
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:45,599
she and i were talking several months

1754
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:49,839
ago oh no month or two ago now

1755
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:53,040
she is no longer margaret she's alex or

1756
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:54,240
they are now called alex so i am working

1757
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,720
my way through that i don't actually

1758
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,520
have a problem

1759
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:57,118
that's kind of cool i'm like you

1760
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:58,640
girlfriend i mean several years ago she

1761
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:00,640
came out to me she's like

1762
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:02,078
i like women i'm like okay good for you

1763
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:03,118
she's like you okay with it i'm like why

1764
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:04,480
wouldn't i be

1765
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:05,920
she's like well i know you're upbringing

1766
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:07,040
and i know how you are i'm like yeah and

1767
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,799
i've evolved

1768
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,920
i have a lot of other thoughts i have a

1769
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:11,359
different way i deal with things

1770
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,559
etcetera etcetera etcetera

1771
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:14,480
and she was a word about freaking

1772
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:15,680
telling me but now she's gone you know

1773
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:17,200
now

1774
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,799
now she has basically said look i'm

1775
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,919
going non-binary i don't mind if you

1776
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:21,359
call me she i don't know if you got me

1777
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:23,680
here i don't mind if you call me

1778
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:25,920
they or whatever i'm learning this but

1779
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:27,440
my name is alex i'm like great alex it

1780
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:29,200
is i've changed it in my phone i've

1781
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,680
changed in my messaging the whole bloody

1782
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:32,558
lot

1783
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:33,440
and to me i'm like i'm fine with that

1784
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:36,240
but

1785
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:37,760
that whole implicit bias that sits at

1786
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:39,520
the back of the head that little voice

1787
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:41,920
that comes out every and again

1788
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:44,160
has questions and as long as you can

1789
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:46,319
take the time to listen to them

1790
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:47,520
understand them realize where the hell

1791
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:50,079
they came from

1792
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:51,920
you know the christmas point we grew up

1793
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:52,240
arguably in a different era than we're

1794
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:55,440
in

1795
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:57,279
now look at alex yeah i

1796
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,880
look at alex and i go to alex and i'm

1797
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:00,799
like hey she

1798
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:02,799
grown up in an entirely different place

1799
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:05,759
i mean so to me it's that it's like

1800
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:06,559
you have to have that basically that

1801
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:09,119
pause button

1802
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:10,640
that secondary voice that you listen to

1803
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:13,119
and you go okay

1804
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:14,799
yeah i can figure this one out and i

1805
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:16,559
think so many people either don't have

1806
00:58:14,799 --> 00:58:19,920
that or they don't listen to it

1807
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:21,280
or they just don't know

1808
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:23,280
what to do with it or they just don't

1809
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,839
accept i mean to chris's point there are

1810
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:26,480
people

1811
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:28,240
that you just have to accept won't or

1812
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:30,640
can't change for whatever reason

1813
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:32,000
and you know rest my father's soul and

1814
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:33,598
all that stuff he was one of those as

1815
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,200
far as he was concerned

1816
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:37,920
if your skin color was different than

1817
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:39,598
his the chances are you're up to no good

1818
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:41,040
and there was nothing i could do with it

1819
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:42,640
no matter how many conversations no

1820
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:43,279
matter how many discussions no much

1821
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:45,200
hamada

1822
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:46,799
it just was what it was so we ended up

1823
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,839
basically compromising and we talked

1824
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:49,440
about the weather

1825
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:51,599
and we talked about british politics

1826
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:53,920
believe it or not and that was it

1827
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:55,200
and we just we knew how to navigate our

1828
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:57,359
conversations

1829
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:58,720
so that so that basically i didn't go

1830
00:58:57,359 --> 00:58:59,359
off on a rant or anything along those

1831
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:02,640
lines

1832
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:05,440
yeah it is nice i think that

1833
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:05,920
when when when we look at all of these

1834
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,960
like

1835
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:12,000
really inflammatory issues from

1836
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:14,319
the lens of either being part of the

1837
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,720
business being a leader in a business

1838
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:17,599
or being the owner founder whatever in a

1839
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:21,200
business

1840
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:25,040
um one of the one of the best levels of

1841
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:25,359
of guidance and i think philosophies on

1842
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:27,359
it

1843
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:28,640
that that i've i've really i've ever

1844
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:31,200
experienced was like

1845
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:32,078
having a chat with mark cuban and mark

1846
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:35,439
cuban

1847
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:37,760
literally saying like it is not about

1848
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:38,799
your business being woke woke is [ __ ]

1849
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:40,760
stupid

1850
00:59:38,799 --> 00:59:42,000
it is about understanding your

1851
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:44,720
responsibility

1852
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,599
and if your responsibility is to be

1853
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:49,118
aware

1854
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:50,880
and make sure that people are given the

1855
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:54,000
opportunity to be the most

1856
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:56,880
effective that they can be

1857
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,160
that's your job as a leader that's your

1858
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:59,680
only job as a leader

1859
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:01,839
it doesn't matter where they're from it

1860
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:04,480
doesn't matter anything else your job

1861
01:00:01,839 --> 01:00:06,240
is to be able to spot the passion and

1862
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:07,200
the talents and the things that they

1863
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:09,439
have

1864
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:11,598
and be able to nurture that and be able

1865
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:14,400
to smash any roadblocks that exist

1866
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:15,920
outside of that if you can't do that

1867
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:17,839
don't lead

1868
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:19,520
that's a huge one and it's i got that

1869
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:20,640
it's in a slide on my damn deck all the

1870
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:23,280
[ __ ] time now

1871
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:23,839
i don't care race color creed eye color

1872
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:26,480
number of

1873
01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:27,599
limbs any of this [ __ ] i just don't can

1874
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:30,480
you do your job

1875
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:31,920
or do you have the passion to do it and

1876
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,960
i can work with you and train you that's

1877
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,960
all i care about

1878
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:36,319
anything else complete i'd rather you

1879
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:37,760
actually able to articulate it in a

1880
01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:39,520
freaking report that would be nice but

1881
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:41,839
if not we can work with that as well

1882
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:43,119
anything else don't give a [ __ ] there is

1883
01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:46,240
a certain type of human

1884
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:47,599
that i distrust by default

1885
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:49,680
and he's just pointing at me on the

1886
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:53,200
screen he's like no no no

1887
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:54,240
no i'm not um that type of person is the

1888
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:57,839
type of person who

1889
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:57,839
is breathing

1890
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,880
do you know that i mean we all know the

1891
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,920
deal yeah and we used to be trust and

1892
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:05,359
verify

1893
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:07,520
i've had to learn that one unfortunately

1894
01:01:05,359 --> 01:01:11,200
the [ __ ] hard way i now verify

1895
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:11,200
then trust ish

1896
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:18,240
exactly yeah you know i so

1897
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:19,040
so so wrapping back around to business

1898
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:21,118
owners

1899
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:22,880
and and how business owners need to deal

1900
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:24,000
with these things and i and i think that

1901
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:27,680
this goes all the way down

1902
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:30,079
to peers and business leaders um

1903
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:30,879
i uh and i'm gonna i'm gonna just say me

1904
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:34,240
personally

1905
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:37,520
right um i believe that

1906
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:38,558
if we take the collective power that we

1907
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:41,599
have

1908
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:42,400
to analyze the situation to determine

1909
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:44,079
whether

1910
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:46,240
you know going back to the question for

1911
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:47,839
me of like oh is this universal like you

1912
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:49,439
don't think sexism exists and all that

1913
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:52,078
stuff no [ __ ] yeah it does

1914
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:53,920
but but if we collectively can look at

1915
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:56,799
that in our environments

1916
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:58,799
and we can say this person isn't going

1917
01:01:56,799 --> 01:02:00,880
to get ahead because the company

1918
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:02,079
is a piece of [ __ ] or the person who's a

1919
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:05,680
[ __ ] manager

1920
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:07,599
has you know some you know holy war

1921
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:09,759
against a certain religion or

1922
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:11,119
a certain race or certain ethos or

1923
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:13,920
whatever else

1924
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:15,760
i think it's on us not to just try and

1925
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:18,960
go out and be like this company

1926
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:20,079
sucks don't work for them i i think the

1927
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:23,280
opposite way

1928
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:25,200
i think we should completely rob that

1929
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:27,280
company of their talent

1930
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:29,439
and that means when we're sitting on the

1931
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:30,559
inside and we see that somebody else is

1932
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:33,119
getting held back

1933
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:34,079
we're like look this person's a [ __ ]

1934
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:36,640
badass

1935
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:38,880
you don't deserve them so one i'm gonna

1936
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:41,359
help them get a better job

1937
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:43,359
two you're gonna now lose that talent

1938
01:02:41,359 --> 01:02:45,359
and this company's not gonna do as well

1939
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:46,960
so if you wanna be altruistic and you

1940
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:49,279
wanna hang yourself out there

1941
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:50,640
go get the person who is being held back

1942
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:53,440
a better job

1943
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:53,759
and ignore how that person was going to

1944
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:56,960
make

1945
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:57,680
your life better that will change

1946
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:59,359
companies

1947
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:01,118
going out and being like oh i'm going to

1948
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:02,960
write an article about about

1949
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:04,720
how everybody was bad inside of this

1950
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:05,440
company [ __ ] it you're gonna have two

1951
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:07,439
people

1952
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:08,559
bitching and moaning online about the

1953
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:10,319
same topic and

1954
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:12,400
nothing's gonna happen to that company

1955
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:14,558
but if you take that all-star talent

1956
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:15,119
that is being held back for whatever

1957
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:16,799
reason

1958
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:19,280
and you help them get into a place where

1959
01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:21,520
they can bloom and they can shine

1960
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:22,720
the company that they got they got

1961
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:24,640
removed from

1962
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:26,558
is not going to be able to receive the

1963
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:27,759
gifts of their talents and the company

1964
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:30,720
that they go to

1965
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:31,280
is going to shine and accelerate that's

1966
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:34,640
how you

1967
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:37,359

01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:59,920
[ __ ] i don't understand

1980
01:03:56,799 --> 01:04:02,960
as long as you can do your job and you

1981
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:05,599
can innovate and you can be passionate

1982
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:06,720
that's all i want to see like and and

1983
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:08,480
once you remove

1984
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:10,799
people from a place that's holding them

1985
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:12,400
down their passion gets to bloom

1986
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:14,240
and that's the most beautiful thing in

1987
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:16,720
the world oh it's so fun

1988
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:18,000
if you want to twist the knife in deeper

1989
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:19,680
after you poach them

1990
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,160
let the shareholders know that the

1991
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:24,879
company was holding back their talent

1992
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:27,598
and you poached them and the company is

1993
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:29,920
not doing what's in your best interest

1994
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:30,799
we are actually running into that one

1995
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:33,039
now yeah well

1996
01:04:30,799 --> 01:04:34,880
so we hit this one now there's one

1997
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:36,640
particular individual in our industry

1998
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:39,039
who runs two companies

1999
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:40,319

2000

2001
01:04:40,319 --> 01:04:44,319
things and there has been derek and

2002
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:46,400

2005
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:50,399
individuals

2006
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:51,839
when you see them actually appearing at

2007
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:53,839
conferences or when they're meant to be

2008
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:54,799

2009
01:04:53,839 --> 01:04:56,480
you get hold of the conference

2010
01:04:54,799 --> 01:04:58,559
organizers say hey have you actually

2011
01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:00,799

2017
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:11,280

01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:23,599
of all of this um one

2023
01:05:20,839 --> 01:05:26,720

of being able to start your own thing

2025
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:30,879
is that it's yours and if you want to be

2026
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,280

2031
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:40,720
horrible racist sexist piece of [ __ ]

2032
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:43,920
that is

2033
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:47,038
has a company that's founded on that i

2034

you are

2038
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:55,039
at the end of the day if we could all

2039
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:58,079
keep ourselves accountable

2040
01:05:55,039 --> 01:06:01,359
the company will blow up in a giant

2041
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:02,559
and prolific fireworks show of dumpster

2042
01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:04,400
fire

2043
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:05,760
and then we can all go well you know

2044
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:07,760
what you gave it a shot

2045
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:09,920
maybe you should be a little bit more

2046
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:11,359
aware of the things that you were doing

2047
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:13,039
in order to integrate with modern

2048
01:06:11,359 --> 01:06:14,240
society because we're not [ __ ]

2049
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:16,079
cavemen anymore

2050
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:18,000
and we have to take these things into

2051
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:19,599
account but who am i to

2052
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,440
tell somebody not to pursue the

2053
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:23,520
nefarious terrible [ __ ]

2054
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:24,799
that they're going to do like i i'm just

2055
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:28,079
not that person like

2056
01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:29,839
i don't feel so entitled in my life

2057
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:31,520
that i should tell somebody what right

2058
01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:34,640
and wrong is what i

2059
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:36,880
do for me is just do right and wrong and

2060
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:37,839
be able to know that when i go to sleep

2061
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:40,640
at night

2062
01:06:37,839 --> 01:06:42,480
i did the best that i could here's one

2063
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:45,359
thing i'll add on to that and

2064
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:46,400
take you with a grain of salt we inside

2065
01:06:45,359 --> 01:06:48,319
the industry

2066
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:50,240

good at doing

2070
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:56,799
people out there don't necessarily know

2071
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:58,240
that they don't know how to measure how

2072
01:06:56,799 --> 01:07:00,480
effective you are

2073
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:01,919
against how effective the douche bag is

2074
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:03,520

01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:13,118
[ __ ] that goes with it

2080
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:13,520
arguably we somehow or other need to

2081
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:16,000
help

2082
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:17,119
businesses organizations entities and

2083
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,920
individuals

2084
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:21,520
figure out how to actually see that how

2085
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:22,640
to peel back the layers how to ask the

2086
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:25,280

simply

2091
01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:32,960
that would be the other thing i'd add on

2092
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:32,960

companies

2106
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:56,799
determine who are the best people not

2107
01:07:55,119 --> 01:07:57,200
the best who is the right for them who

2108
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:58,640
would it

2109
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:01,839
get the right [ __ ] questions in their

2110
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:01,839
hands and make it simple

2111
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:07,039

2112
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:10,960

2113
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:12,799

we have we have a friday night tradition

2119
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:26,400
that started with covid

2120
01:08:22,238 --> 01:08:29,120
so trying to maintain that tradition

2121
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:30,479
um were you telling me this is to get

2122

this to shut up and get the hell off of

2123
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:35,040
this so you can go get dinner

2124

that was it easy

2126
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:43,920
the question is let me get back to my

2127
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:47,600

2143
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:20,000
in

2144
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:21,759
um let's say promoting in the industry

2145
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:24,640
right like and i and i learned this

2146
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:26,319
a couple years ago um and have been

2147
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:29,359
since trying to work on it

2148
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:31,359
but the

2149
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:32,719
the idea of the blacksmith the

2150
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:35,440
apprenticeship right

2151
01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:37,040
um we we took it a little bit far in a

2152
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:38,719
couple different directions where it was

2153
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:39,519
like well if you're not grinding 12

2154
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:41,759
hours a day

2155
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:43,199
if you're not working so much that your

2156
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:45,279
family hates you and you have to get a

2157
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:47,198
divorce and your kids disown you and all

2158
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:48,400
that stuff then you know you're not

2159
01:09:47,198 --> 01:09:51,519
working at all

2160
01:09:48,399 --> 01:09:52,479
um i i think that that's another thing

2161
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:55,760
that we need

2162
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:57,120
to we need to realize in our lives and

2163
01:09:55,760 --> 01:10:00,480
try and disconnect from

2164
01:09:57,120 --> 01:10:03,599
is there there's a place for work

2165
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:05,599
there is a place for hobby and and

2166
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:07,120
you know a lot of us who have gotten

2167
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:09,040
into this industry

2168
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:10,960
did it because we are so passionate

2169
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:14,000
about the things that we do

2170
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:15,520
that we do it in our free time so we

2171
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,520
ended up having

2172
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:18,560
this industry that was founded like you

2173
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:21,840
know if

2174
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:24,880
if your job was to taste

2175
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:26,560
bourbon for a living and you were also

2176
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:29,600
an alcoholic

2177
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:31,280
it's not super good for you because

2178
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:33,280
guess what you're gonna work all the

2179
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:34,639
time and you're gonna [ __ ] everything

2180
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:37,840
else in your life up

2181
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:40,480
so to wrap up this segment of

2182
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:42,239
what it is like in business we also have

2183
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:44,799
to recognize that

2184
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:47,040
that exists i think that we have to

2185
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:47,600
recognize that about our peers about all

2186
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:49,840
of us

2187
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:50,880
here on the call together whether we're

2188
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:52,880
leaders whether we're

2189
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:55,199
owners whether we're something else we

2190
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:58,000
have to set those guideline points

2191
01:10:55,199 --> 01:10:59,199
so that when somebody says it's my

2192
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,600
tradition

2193
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:02,320
to be able to spend this time with our

2194
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:04,320
family

2195
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:06,559
our first answer isn't like [ __ ] you

2196
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:08,960
work harder our first answer is

2197
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:10,719
hell yeah i need to probably integrate

2198
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:12,080
that into my life because i know i'm not

2199
01:11:10,719 --> 01:11:14,400
spending enough time

2200
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:16,320
doing these other things outside of my

2201
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:19,839
passionate piece of work

2202
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:21,599
so i am all about that and i think that

2203
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:24,560
it's one more of those things

2204
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:26,000
inside of the business of security that

2205
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:29,040
we need to think about

2206
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:31,520
of sometimes it's not just working

2207
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:32,320
more hours or more days sometimes it's

2208
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:35,199
being

2209
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:36,639
let's say woke enough to realize that

2210
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:39,040
the people that are working

2211
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:40,560
need to shut it the [ __ ] down i'm

2212
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:42,880
actually going to add on to that i

2213
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:44,320
learned from chris actually and from a

2214
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:45,040
number of others to do this [ __ ] and

2215
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:47,120
actually now

2216
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:48,320
arguably this is eating into my time i

2217
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:49,840
monday through friday

2218
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:51,759

2219

night to nine o'clock at night

2221
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:56,799

2222
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:57,839
that's time with the dogs time with jen

2223

01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:25,599
you on your screen as well let's just

2240
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:27,520
put it that way

2241
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:30,400
yeah yeah i was i was wondering which

2242
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:30,400
chris too because

2243
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:37,840
uh oh that's right i'm tc nobody ever

2244
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:37,840
nobody calls me address

2245
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:46,000
thank you guys for letting us come to

2246
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:48,880
rant thank you for

2247
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,600
being open and available to talk about

2248
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:52,880
things

2249
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:54,719
that are hard to talk about and and also

2250
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:56,320
being respectful enough to allow

2251
01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:57,679
everyone to have their own opinion

2252
01:12:56,320 --> 01:13:00,719
because i think that

2253
01:12:57,679 --> 01:13:03,920
when when i look at anything inside of

2254
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:06,640
the originations of of b-sides

2255
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:08,239
and and where a lot of these talks in

2256
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:10,239
the community have come from

2257
01:13:08,239 --> 01:13:11,440
one of the things that i am the most

2258
01:13:10,239 --> 01:13:14,559
proud of

2259
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:16,400
is that we've been able to create some

2260
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:18,159
safe spaces for people to have hard

2261
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:18,960
conversations where people might not

2262
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:21,120
agree

2263
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:23,040
and and i think that the more and more

2264
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:24,800
that we can incorporate that

2265
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:27,679
into our daily lives and our business

2266
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:28,400
lives um the more that the ethos of this

2267
01:13:27,679 --> 01:13:30,320
community

2268
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:32,159
of being able to talk about the hard

2269
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:33,120
problems but talk about them in a safe

2270
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:34,879
space

2271
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:36,480
is is something that benefits the

2272
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:39,679
entirety of the world so

2273
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:41,599
i i just really really appreciate that

2274
01:13:39,679 --> 01:13:43,600
like y'all let us come talk about these

2275
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:45,120
things and aren't just judging and

2276
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:47,679
aren't putting it on blast but

2277
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:49,280
that are really just you know here here

2278
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:50,640
to work together to make to make

2279
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:51,840
something that's different to make

2280
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:53,920
something that's

2281
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:55,679
that's available that has permission

2282
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:57,120
that has hopes that has

2283
01:13:55,679 --> 01:13:59,120
you know an infinite level of

2284
01:13:57,120 --> 01:14:02,000
possibility and and so i

2285
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:03,840
i really really appreciate still being

2286
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,000
allowed to be in a community that's like

2287
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:08,400
that

2288
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,679
