1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:04,799
perfect perfect okay

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,240
hopefully everyone's good to go all

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,200
right um so

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,280
i was going to do this a little

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,240
different um i've been in the industry

6
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,280
for a while

7
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,120
one of my favorite things to do is um

8
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,038
is actually help people get into the

9
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,000
industry um i've done some pretty

10
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,080
intense talks

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,439
and and as you guys thought watching you

12
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,038
guys you guys have some pretty in-depth

13
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,480
stuff which i think is wonderful and i

14
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,240
really appreciate that

15
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,760
um working with a lot of people they

16
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,038
always want to know like you know

17
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,960
i want to be a pen tester because that's

18
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,559
what everyone wants to be and and

19
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,000
it's sad because the blue team gets sad

20
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:35,919
because they always get like um

21
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,079
like people who like right click and

22
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,360
change uh admin accounts and ad and

23
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,920
stuff like that

24
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,879
so i'm trying to like get more like what

25
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,239
pin testing is this is super high level

26
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,320
wait if you have some questions i can go

27
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,320
pretty deep as possible um

28
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,840
i do have some qualifiers like let you

29
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,039
know who i am um

30
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,320
if you guys have any questions i could

31
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,199
talk about anything you want to talk

32
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,520
about

33
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,640
um except bitcoin i don't have any time

34
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,640
for that so i think it's a different

35
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,840
talk this afternoon so

36
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,960

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,280
i'll let you guys know the best places

46
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,080
you can win at the casino

47
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,159
also if you guys didn't know um i was

48
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,280
there when the guy hacked the um

49
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:34,159
the temperature gauge on the fish tank

50
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,000
um and he was able to uh laterally move

51
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,799
into the casino and breach that i don't

52
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,119
know if you guys

53
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,400
caught that it was actually it was it

54
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,040
was really cool so

55
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,159
um so again that's who i am if you guys

56
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,040

let me know

58
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,720
um and i kind of start this from the

59
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,200
get-go first of all

60
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,640
i love this this uh this this movie if

kung fu fury i'm not sponsored by them

63
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,679
but it is hilarious because

64
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,360
this is this is the hacker man right so

65
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,040
um anytime you get into

66
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,399
like a red team incident everyone's like

67
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,079
man i want to get in there i wanna i'm

68
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,200
gonna roll these scripts i want a hacker

69
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,878
man if i

70
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,319
have a background in coding can i be the

71
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,280
best hacker

72
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:14,640
um i would say out of all the pen tests

73
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,120
that i've performed

74
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,319
um you don't you have to be that we'll

75
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,080
say

76
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,440
code intelligence one thing i can do a

77
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,360
little bit of coding but i'm not a coder

78
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,920
nor have i ever been

79
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,920
my i have heavy background in networking

80
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,040
and digital forensics

81
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,559
and um stuff like that network forensics

82
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,160
you know even desktop support so i've

83
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,239
came up through the ranks even starting

84
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,079
at like a help desk um

85
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,560
learning what a computer does how it

86
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,080
works um a lot of vulnerabilities aren't

87
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,760
really

88
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,440
like you know a new vulnerability

89
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,120
there's got rece or an o day right

90
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,480
those do happen but to actually get a

91
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,720
hold of those and actually be working

92
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,760
for a client unless you just you know

93
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,959
you you do it for fun um at midnight on

94
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,518
your vpn client

95
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,959
coming in from russia um you know you

96
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,480
don't you don't really get to get a lot

97
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,280
of that stuff so working in

98
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,079
in the the private sector like what i do

99
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,080
i'm just trying to

100
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,120
take take the you know the hackerman

101
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,120
kind of thing and

102
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,319
everyone wants to be one which is it's

103
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,080
fine it's cool but

104
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,000
maybe like maybe if you could make some

105
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,840
money and not go to jail

106
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,319
might be might be another option so

107
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,560
that's that's kind of what i do so um

108
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,560
offering these ideas and these

109
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,080
opportunities to people that

110
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,319
feel that they need to be more advanced

111
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,159
than they are um so i'm just gonna go

112
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,119
through that the methodology that that

113
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,040
i've come up with

114
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,159
um as i go through and i'll just show

115
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,679
you some steps

116
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,120
you know without using like heavy

117
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,480
exploits and stuff like that and what

118
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,120
i've done to um

119
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,959
take over companies um within you know

120
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,440
five to ten minutes just

121
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:46,080
using uh tools that are free and are

122
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,560
basically generic networking tools so

123
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,720
again a high level um this is more for a

124
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,280
crowd that wants to get in the industry

125
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,879
and i always always try to be a huge

126
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,879
advocate for people that want to learn

127
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,560
because i feel like um the more we share

128
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,200
the more we grow and i'm always looking

129
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,799
for

130
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,319
people's feedback and people coming in

131
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,120
the street because we they're it's

132
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,560
pretty limited

133
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,519
so i went off my soapbox so getting into

134
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,360
pin testing so

135
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,840
like first you got to get a baseline for

136
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,480
security like what does that even mean

137
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,040
getting a pen test is um it's just

138
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,639
saying like

139
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,199
okay why are you doing it what's the

140
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,799
whole point of it and what are the goals

141
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,320
some people don't want you to just break

142
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:24,239
in and start just uh

143
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,479
just we'll say trying to exfil their

144
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,280
data that's not really what they want

145
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:31,120
there's more value out of hey you know

146
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,479
your email server is open to the

147
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,360
internet for some reason i don't know

148
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,440
why

149
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,360
we had a client that just had a baseline

150
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,719
and they wanted red team exercise was

151
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,800
their term

152
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,000
they wanted it on one ip address and it

153
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,919
was their email server

154
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
and just generically we were able to

155
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,359
trace their their email routes and find

156
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,720
that they were going through some

157
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,320
it was like an old email admin

158
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,960
had actually set up some boxes at his

159
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,000
house and all that company's email was

160
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,159
going through their

161
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,160
um was going through that guy's house uh

162
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,320
for about what six years and he had been

163
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,720
gone for four of those six years

164
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,759
and what does that mean that means that

165
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,080
uh he was

166
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,080
potentially didn't say was was stealing

167
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,680
uh their company information private

168
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,280
information for four years

169
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,280
i'm kind of writing this into the blue

170
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,440
team because if you don't

171
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,719
know blue team it's hard to do red team

172
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,600
and if you don't know red team it's hard

173
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,600
to do blue team

174
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,960
right so kind of kind of bringing those

175
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,800
together um

176
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,239
and the second is i always discover a

177
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,639
vulnerability you know what does that

178
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,639
mean

179
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,240
is it uh everyone wants to talk about

180
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,680
again you know the latest and greatest

181
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,840
vulnerability that's happened

182
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,919
um you know my favorite which i'll talk

183
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,119
about is eternal blue and i'm so upset

184
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,000
that people are upgrading their stuff

185
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,080
because that was super

186
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,680
fun we're gonna go through that um but

187
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,560
like even like an open port

188
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,080
i'll give you an easy example um if you

189
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,520
guys use there's like a

190
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:52,000
uh open port scanner or angular ip

191
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,198
or something like that um ports right so

192
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,039
people don't think about that as a

193
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,880
vulnerability it totally is like you

194
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,680
don't have to have like a some type of

195
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,080
you know

196
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,160
nessa scanner or even your open source

197
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,440
scanner or whatever quality just

198
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,000
run a port scan and what you could do is

199
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,680
find like

200
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,919
i mean generically like even last week i

201
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,479
ran one on a client we were working for

202
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,840
and they had

203
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:15,840
ftp open okay that's not maybe abnormal

204
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,000
kind of weird they're using still ftp

205
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,758
so i just pull up my filezilla because

206
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,039
it's super easy and it's free

207
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,319
and then i just log in anonymously and

208
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,080
maybe you guys think that's kind of

209
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,919
weird and that doesn't happen well it

210
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,080
happens all the time

211
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,159
i do appreciate that the industry is way

212
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,039
ahead of its curve on some big heavy pen

213
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,440
testing

214
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,400
items but i would say like you know i

215
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,560
mean eight

216
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,000
ninety five percent of all companies

217
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,080
have never had a pen test

218
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,280
maybe ninety they they know what it is

219
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,440
they know they need it

220
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,599
and if they do get a pen test it's not a

221
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,840
pen test it's it's a nessus scan

222
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,280
and and whoever bills them for that

223
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,520
calls it a pen test

224
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,799
um personally i mean even just having a

225
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,599
port scan

226
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:00,160
what's open is is pretty amazing it's

227
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:02,719
also a good idea using a port scanner

228
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,520
to see because you have these super

229
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,240
crazy

230
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,719
you know crafty it guys that um will

231
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,680
change uh the ports right so they'll say

232
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,319
hey minute telnet

233
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,680
it's not uh what it is and it's like one

234
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,800
three three seven which is one of my

235
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,520
favorite ones anyone

236
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,240
tries to change a port to elite is a is

237
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,919
i'm all in

238
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,759
i think there's a guy in the picture

239
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,159
right now they're a hacker man right

240
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,080
so it's on port lee also some great

241
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,160
trojans running on that port anyway but

242
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,758
it's good to know like we're all talking

243
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,000
about breaking into something heavy but

244
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,560
just

245
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,479
breaking into just like normal person um

246
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,840
environment or company they're not

247
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,199
running uh they're not closing their

248
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,520
ports that are open or they don't even

249
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,000
know

250
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,000
typically

251
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,720
secure your environment of course right

252
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,080
so that's kind of why you did right

253
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,479
because you don't know what you don't

254
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,840
know

255
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,199
right so a lot of people are like we

256
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,758
don't need a pen test because we're

257
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,560
secure

258
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,080
well how do you know and if you do know

259
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,800
have you done a pen test and if you have

260
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,680
a pen test

261
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,000
you actually find the right

262
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,680
vulnerabilities that's why in any

263
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,280
group as you guys if you have any

264
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,639
corporate people here is um

265
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,400
you should always rotate your pen

266
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,599
testers after a certain amount of time

267
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,799
because they're vertical

268
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,639
and just like the gentleman was saying

269
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,919
earlier your vision your scope is

270
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,759
different right whether you come

271
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,198
you know from whatever your background

272
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,199
is whether it's you know teaching

273
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,440
or you know where you grew up like your

274
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:20,000
your your vision your your your scope

275
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,520
of that is totally changed and the focus

276
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,599
of the actual attack

277
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,198
will be different so it's it's a it's

278
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,400
it's a it's a pretty cool thing you know

279
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,800
that's why i always like to mix it up

280
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,280
and

281
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,319
have new people with new ideas again

282
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,679
having this talk is uh

283
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,360
trying to get new people in the industry

284
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,200
with has a different background than

285
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,839
us on this uh call today um also another

286
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,719
reason

287
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,680
pen test right you make auditors happy

288
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,279
and which

289
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,040
whatever right so if you need that you

290
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,560
should get that and also this kind of

291
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,399
pivots into the blue team

292
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,000
one of the things i do the most when

293
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,680
doing a pen test and i give this to you

294
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,680
guys is i highly recommend is

295
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,599
when you're doing like a sql injection

296
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,399
or when you're doing some type of

297
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,080
um you know some some type of attack i

298
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,680
always recommend that you record those

299
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,800
times you write the time down you know

300
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,199
you know 11 o'clock i was trying to ddos

301
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,000
the discord server maybe i was maybe i

302
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,240
wasn't who knows

303
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
but you know um did anyone catch the

304
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,320
logs were you guys paying attention

305
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,920
if i'd if i was attacking you do you

306
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,600
even know what it would look like

307
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,360
um going back swinging back to the blue

308
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,440
team is

309
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,880
if you have an attack and when you get

310
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,760
into the blue team vibe right you have

311
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,439
these like

312
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,200
cool you know devices that when

313
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,640
something goes bad it blinks red at you

314
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,640
and that means bad right so you have

315
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,439
this red light and it's like hey man

316
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,040
this is bad and then you respond but

317
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,640
what if someone broke in your facility

318
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,920
and you didn't know so that goes back to

319
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,199
you don't know what you don't know so

320
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,800
doing pen tests

321
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,240
um you've got to document when you're

322
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,599
doing your attacks because

323
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,160
it's going to help the client it's going

324
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,279
to help you guys even internally if you

325
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,120
you know working on your own home

326
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,120
network and stuff like that if you do

327
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,720
you know cause a brute force attack

328
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,800
that's cool did you see it

329
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,120
and if you didn't why did you not uh

330
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,680
kind of going back this goes back to uh

331
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,240
even incident response through pin

332
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,479
testing

333
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,000
hacker came in they did a brute force

334
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,839
well how long were they brute forcing

335
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,519
oh well apparently it was three months

336
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,680
okay well that's that's not good

337
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,200
so and then we have to go back and find

338
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,560
those rules um i think

339
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,839
pin testing uh to me is like is like uh

340
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,359
the first getting there you gotta find

341
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,760
the vulnerability you pin test and you

342
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,040
can start encouraging the blue team

343
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,319
so i just kind of want to throw it out

344
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,599
there plus you know you get these cool

345
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,519
reports in the auditors and

346
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,040
you know company still makes money um

347
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,040
also the last reason

348
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:32,240
everyone is a pen tester wants to be is

349
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:35,279
because you can be super cool hackerman

350
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,880
and um you get to go to cool cool

351
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,040
conferences like this

352
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,880
and like defcon and you know you can

353
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,560
wear black black t-shirts you know and

354
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,920
you won't be called like a goth or

355
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,239
anything right because you'll be you'll

356
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,599
be

357
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,760
you'll be like the new punk rock right

358
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,200
you know everyone watches uh mr robot

359
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,439
these days so i think that's a

360
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,200
that's the new vibe i like that um

361
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,800
during this presentation i actually

362
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,079
do like you guys to learn a lot so if

363
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,040
you have any questions you just want to

364
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,599
interrupt me

365
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,480
or or just tell me to be to be quiet or

366
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,040

367
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,800
totally open to that i have someone

368
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,399
actually uh watching that so

369
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,519
if so they can stop me and tell me to

370
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,320
stop talking so if you have any

371
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,160
questions

372
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,519
type them in and give me a hard time and

373
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:17,199
again i appreciate you guys inviting me

374
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,839
okay first thing before i even get into

375
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,000
like

376
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,680
like hacking so we have things called

377
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,800
the red team exercise

378
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,359
you guys may have heard this this is

379
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,120
like to me says the true pen test um

380
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,320
a traditional pen test and i'm just

381
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,680
trying to give you guys the scope

382
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,920
because i feel like a lot of people are

383
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,319
always so deep about what they're into

384
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,120
um a pen test traditionally is someone

385
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,959
comes in

386
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,560
and what they do is they they like come

387
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,959
on in come sit down and

388
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,959
you plug into their network and they

389
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,399
have dhcp or they have static and if

390
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,880
they have static then they give you an

391
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,160
ip

392
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,320
and then you start to perform your

393
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,040
hacking to me that's not a real pen test

394
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,560
that's that's

395
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,920
that is a organized vulnerability

396
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,839
assessment internal pin

397
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,519
that is not a real pen test because as

398
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,600
you guys know when

399
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,440
when you got if you guys never get asked

400
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,600
hey man i need to breach this company

401
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,959
um you what's the first thing you do and

402
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,440
if you don't know that i'm glad you're

403
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,319
here

404
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,079
uh ex exposure intelligence right so so

405
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,079
i give you guys something super simple

406
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,279
right so when we when we're doing like

407
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,199
um uh

408
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,320
a full red team engagement so it's top

409
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,240
to bottom so

410
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,680
we do vishing obviously voice phone

411
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,680
calls um

412
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,040
phishing which is you know click emails

413
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,560
those are i mean those are pretty cool

414
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,959
and hot and everyone talks about those

415
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,399
but

416
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,319
to me they're kind of boring just

417
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,720
keeping it real um

418
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,880
what i like to do is um technically

419
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,920
we'll try to do first thing is whaling

420
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,839
uh that's a

421
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,120
term i'm for sure that i made up so what

422
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,800
i like to do is immediately you know

423
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,560
generically go to linkedin

424
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,240
and then get all the cool technical

425
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,719
people because everyone wants to

426
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,920
say what they're doing and typically

427
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,959
over time you'll know

428
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,880
if they have a

429
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,800
has a their email address so their

430
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,160
domain right so

431
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,839
mine if you want to look mine up it's

432
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,319
totally cool but you'll know my domain

433
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,040
right

434
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,200
so it's either first name domain or

435
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,599
first name dot last name domain or first

436
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,839
letter

437
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,000
last name domain what that does is you

438
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:09,360
can basically really quick go on the the

439
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,160
internets and linkedin or facebook or

440
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,680
you know that other

441
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,240
uh trash i mean uh social media and uh

442
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,399
you can

443
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,519
you can quickly find all you all the

444
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,360
people you need to attack

445
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,959
uh or they're seeing email or stuff like

446
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,079
that there's also free

447
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:25,518
um verified email stuff that you can go

448
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,199
on you can type an email and see if it

449
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,519
punches back there is some

450
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,360
resistance in that because it is free

451
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,839
and if for some reason use too many a

452
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,760
day

453
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,880
um just use your vpn just connect from a

454
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,399
different one so you can have

455
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,279
kind of an unlimited verification of

456
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,279
email

457
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,800
um and also what i love the most is when

458
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,600
we before we do like a straight

459
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,719
like cold red team attack meaning all we

460
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,959
have is a company

461
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,240
i love it when people put their talents

462
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,040
that is something that they're most

463
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,360
proud of

464
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,599
and having that knowledge that's how we

465
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,600
will kind of classify our attack

466
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,800
if someone always talks about social

467
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,320
engineering through

468
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,079
emails and stuff like that we probably

469
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,680
won't go that route so then we'll kind

470
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,040
of flip the script and what we'll do is

471
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,479
we'll probably go to

472
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:11,360
a physical pen test we'll try to

473
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,360
ethically break in to the company either

474
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,920
through their badge system

475
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,279
or their card system so what we'll do is

476
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,439
if we feel there's too much

477
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,040
we'll say talent watching the the uh the

478
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,199
actual border of the infrastructure

479
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,719
i have the network uh we'll go on site

480
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,800
we will uh

481
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,079
case the place which which is love again

482
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,000
we're like uh

483
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,760
professional paid criminals by the way

484
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,680
um we'll go in case the place

485
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,519
and we will actually look at everyone's

486
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,839
badge we will go to home depot

487
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,680
our home depot office depot and we can

488
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,240
recreate that badge within you know

489
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,160
about

490
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,399
you know 10 minutes tops right we just

491
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,680
got to reclassify it and get it

492
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,480
and that's kind of another reason how we

493
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,239
go in a good story behind that

494
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,160
um as we as i kind of go through the

495
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,360
presentation is we had a client who

496
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,000
their network was pretty

497
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,360
rock solid we couldn't get any spoofing

498
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,120
emails through we had already

499
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,480
called all the information from linkedin

500
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,320
facebook

501
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,079
and we were just not getting anywhere so

502
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,480
what we had done was

503
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,519
um we had actually uh gone casey

504
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,399
facility

505
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,240
um i found that there was a few people

506
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,120
that were outside smoking

507
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,000
so we created a badge for the to get in

508
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,920
the facility

509
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,600
and it was funny as one of my engineers

510
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,760
and i was like hey man do you smoke

511
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,079
he's like nope and i was like you do now

512
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:26,959
so i went and bought him a pack of

513
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:28,319
cool camel crushes and uh and i had him

514
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,518
sit outside with the smokers and list

515
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,800
what they were saying

516
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,079
so the whole point was what we're gonna

517
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,800
do is we're gonna have to sandwich into

518
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,719
the company

519
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,240
so sandwiches like like a sandwich right

520
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,480
so you got two people here whatever

521
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,600
we're gonna go in the middle so we're

522
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,120
able to scan through

523
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,079
and if you guys realize as he went

524
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,279
through that he was listening what they

525
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,319
were saying they were talking about what

526
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,839
our client does

527
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,920
he was able to ride the elevator with

528
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,759
them go up to the top floor

529
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,920
and scan in they even said no you go

530
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,560
first he's like no sir after you because

531
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,800
they were being

532
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,160
overly polite and it almost caused us to

533
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,040
get caught so

534
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,319
um first guy badged in my guy badged in

535
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,439
if you guys don't know this when you

536
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,240
have a badge

537
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,120
it actually will scan it'll go beep um

538
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,360
it may

539
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,639
turn it'll turn red or green right but

540
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,759
it'll still be you won't hear a

541
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,480
different sound unless it's a different

542
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,399
mechanism

543
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,079
so all they did was hurt a beep right so

544
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,079
we're using that the intelligence of

545
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,120
normal behavior hey this guy's talking

546
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,120
what we're talking about

547
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,880
he's come up the same floor i heard a

548
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,480
beep and they let him right in

549
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,079
and the cool part about that was i told

550
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,600
them to go in and i told them that they

551
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,359
were having lunch so i told them

552
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,040
make them apply to lunch and then that's

553
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,360
how we were able to input

554
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:37,120
usb sticks kind of going back through

555
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:39,600
that yes

556
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,040
okay so a red team a red team engagement

557
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,480
again in my vernacular

558
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:46,639
is we have a company name go fight

559
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,759
that's pretty much all we ever get and

560
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,000
that's that's the real

561
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,079
exercise of trying to attack a company

562
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,759
as opposed to a pen test a pen test is

563
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:56,880
more of a

564
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:59,839
orchestrated simulation of an attack

565
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:02,000
you could do a quote pen test from the

566
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,240
internet you could do a pen test

567
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,679
internal you could log in you know

568
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,439
that's where i say they walk you in and

569
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,839
you do your network scanning tools like

570
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,400
that

571
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,000
i classify that as a pen test um a red

572
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,280
teaming is the stuff that i love that

573
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,959
stuff is super cool

574
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,039
and that's where they give you the the

575
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:20,559
full scope just a hey here's a company

576
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:23,199
name just do what you got to do

577
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,559
okay cool thanks for the question okay

578
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,799
i'm kind of going through um

579
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,879
as before we attack we have the red team

580
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,879
on the pin testing uh man it's so easy

581
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,679
like man you guys can find ip ranges

582
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,080
if you guys don't use showdan shame on

583
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,799
you

584
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,639
welcome to showdan it's free all you

585
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,000
gotta do is type in a company email i

586
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,240
mean a company name

587
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,520
it won't come back every time but it

588
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,039
will if you just give us some time

589
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,520
right you just gotta research and

590
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:50,640
research if they give you an external ip

591
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,160
address you can do more research on that

592
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,080
obviously they're business partners

593
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,039
another thing we were able to do is

594
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,720
we were able to call into a company what

595
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,080
companies love to do is brag about their

596
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,160
business partners and the business

597
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,840
they do with those partners we found a

598
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,360
client that had said hey we're doing

599
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,399
business with this big development

600
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,639
company they're called

601
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,840
x and they're here and here's the guy

602
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,600
we're doing business with

603
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,199
so what we did we took that awesome

604
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,320
press release and built a

605
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,160
uh built a basically a vision campaign

606
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,320
so i called in myself and i was able to

607
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,440
convince the lead designer

608
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,879
that we were going to send them a new

609
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,400
upgrade since there was a software

610
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,960
development company we have some devs on

611
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,799
our side

612
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,120
that we created exploit and we were able

613
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:30,559
to um infiltrate the company and upload

614
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,159
the exploit to the uh

615
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,399
test server and that was part of the

616
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:37,039
part of the job and also um

617
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,799
known vulnerabilities again i just go

618
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,480
back to i go generically there's many

619
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,918
other sites

620
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,160
even even showdown shows no

621
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:46,400
vulnerabilities um they're out there

622
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,919
um it's it's that easy and from that

623
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,240
point you have linkedin information you

624
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,039
have

625
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,080
uh ip ranges and also net worth right um

626
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,280
i think this is where a lot of the

627
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,480
ransomware guys

628
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,799
i think they're getting smarter about

629
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,440
this i mean they they hit up a company

630
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,280
and it's called

631
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,799
x they got to type in company name net

632
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,240
worth and they'll say hey they're not

633
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,360
worth 20 million they're worth five

634
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,039
billion dollars

635
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,559
and then the ransom goes up and if they

636
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,879
don't do that then i just gave them too

637
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,960
much

638
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,400
information but just saying it's out

639
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,039
there

640
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,320
um pastebin sites oh my gosh man if uh

641
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,000
my favorite thing to do

642
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,600
probably every day is watch the trending

643
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,760
pastebin site uh

644
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,600
trending paste bin um you can go on

645
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,440
there there's username passwords

646
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,439
uh we have some callers that we like to

647
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,799
do so when we do reconnaissance may we

648
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,320
have some leak stuff that's only out

649
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,760
there for a day or two

650
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,480
um again let me take a step back for

651
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,400
some other people pace been sight

652
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,080
is when people anonymously post

653
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,039
something typically they usually do it

654
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,199
for doxing

655
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,160
uh it's i mean it's just it's that's

656
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,320
what they do

657
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,480
docsting or they also do it for um

658
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,799
leaked credentials

659
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,640
vulnerability code they also do it if

660
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,320
they're about to breach a company

661
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,320
they will put it out there and say hey

662
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,600
i'm going to ransom you and that's how

663
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,799
they show proof so they'll throw a

664
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,480
paceman link up

665
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,840
uh if a company is getting hacked that's

666
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,840
that's another that's another way that

667
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,600
they transfer that information saying

668
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,439
hey not only did i hack you here's a

669
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,280
taste of the data i've seen databases

670
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,240
leaked out there

671
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,320
i'm i'm gonna tell you another one we

672
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,039
worked for um a company

673
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,559
uh was uh got breached and they got a

674
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:14,240
really cool email to their network

675
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,559
administrator and it said hey

676
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,000
guess what we have all your stuff and if

677
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,520
you don't give us money we're just gonna

678
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,360
collapse everything

679
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,559
so what they had done is they had

680
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,520
actually leaked

681
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,000
they said that they were going to leak

682
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,400
this information to a paceman site

683
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,559
we got engaged checked it out and it was

684
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,000
it was it was pretty legit

685
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,158
lucky enough that that i guess the

686
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,679
client decided that that data was old

687
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,200
and it wasn't worth their time but it

688
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,480
was interesting to see that kind of play

689
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,400
out in real time

690
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,080
that there are people out there that do

691
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,000
that for you know different reasons i

692
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,360
mean whatever hackers are out there so

693
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,200
that's why you guys all have a job if

694
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,678
you're in this industry so

695
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,760
you say thank you to them today all

696
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,880
right dark web i know this sounds like

697
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,120
cliche and i

698
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,000
apologize to everyone who's cringing at

699
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,120
this point

700
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,919
i do as well but it's fine so if you

701
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,760
actually can go

702
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,200
on the dark web deep web and you can

703
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,559
literally buy

704
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,880
exploits be careful because they

705
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,720
probably have malware in them anyway

706
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,960
i only give this example because we were

707
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,360
able to go on there and buy a rat

708
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,400
remote access tool uh that's what a rat

709
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,719
is sorry about that

710
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,799
um where we we paid it was like as

711
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,240
little as five bucks so we have a an

712
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:22,240
off whatever have we have a bitcoin

713
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,760
thing that we use and we're buying stuff

714
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,440
um kind of back and forth through some

715
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,559
bitcoin exchanges so then we'll talk

716
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,400
about that let me

717
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,320
never mind forget bitcoin but we bought

718
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,080
it there and it actually gave us remote

719
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,960
access to a client

720
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,280
um inside of their financials and how

721
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,640
that

722
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,158
because again that's the red team right

723
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,440
so we found out we got a rat available

724
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,000
we were able to load in

725
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,080
and start taking access to that company

726
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,520
um what we found out the next thing was

727
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,439
we had to immediately contact that

728
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,440
client say yo man we were able to get in

729
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,799
this is not good uh and then we have to

730
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,640
figure out why did this happen why would

731
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,240
this even be available this was when

732
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,320
teamviewer didn't have the dual

733
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,280
authentication uh yet

734
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,080
and uh what happened was the um the head

735
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,480
financial

736
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,199
leader advisor whatever for the company

737
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,640
um

738
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,480
uh had some computer issues on the

739
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,799
weekend and her son's uh

740
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,760
friend did computer work so he installed

741
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,960
teamviewer on there

742
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,120
i was able to get in with default

743
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,640
credentials boom and that's kind of he

744
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,678
just never uninstalled it so that's

745
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,360
that's how it happened so you kind of

746
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,799
have a full circle which i love having

747
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,639
the red team having the blue team

748
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,400
you can learn a lot and again for all

749
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,919
you people in the middle purple team as

750
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,360
well right so that kind of makes the

751
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,640
blend there right you don't know what

752
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,158
you don't know

753
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:32,720
reconnaissance list forums discovery

754
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:34,159
um purchase data about the company you

755
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,720
can do this all the time i mean you can

756
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,440
be in

757
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,840
forums i don't have too much as i used

758
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,200
to

759
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,039
i used to do there was like a few

760
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,520
accounts i had sock puppet accounts

761
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,879
um sock puppeting is like a sock puppy

762
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,240
and put a sock on your hand

763
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,240
and you go in a forum and then you just

764
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,799
start like google translating all your

765
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,919
um

766
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:54,240
all your uh english into mandarin or

767
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,520
uh or russian so then you can look super

768
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,240
cool and it's a little confusing because

769
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,918
it doesn't quite

770
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,520
add up but then you can start getting

771
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,360
some information then translate the

772
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,120
information that's in the forum

773
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,959
that could be potentially locked to the

774
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,678
outside good luck getting access these

775
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,039
days but

776
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,799
it is a thing that happens and that's

777
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:12,080
kind of how that works

778
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,080
okay any questions yet

779
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,919
perfect okay all right here's one tool

780
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,678
that we use

781
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,480
um you guys can use this it's it's a

782
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:23,520
free 99 which is my favorite price this

783
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,400
tool is called maltigo um again it has

784
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,760
an example i

785
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,760
use theirs because i didn't ask for

786
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,960
permission to uh put this in the slides

787
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,760
so i'm just using stuff from the

788
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,679
internet

789
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,840
um so i can't you know i'm not endorsed

790
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:37,120
by these guys but they're super cool

791
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:39,199
it's free it's it's it's it's on cali

792
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,479
again you can type in an email address

793
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,640
uh you can type in

794
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,039

797
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,559
for you really

798
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,000
super historic linux unix people out

799
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,440
there have also come up

800
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,600
and it does like this really cool like

801
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,480
spider pattern on who's connected to

802
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,520
what

803
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:02,559
also comments on youtube comments on

804
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:04,158
google video r.i.p

805
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,440
all kinds of stuff out there and and if

806
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,960
you want to get a super a little more

807
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,520
advanced about you can pay for other

808
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,440
threat feeds inside of multigo

809
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,400
and it's it's minimal i mean if you

810
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,279
really want to do some real cool

811
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,000
reconnaissance

812
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,400
here's what you use um we may or may not

813
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,480
use

814
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,080
tools just like this before you hire

815
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,520
anyone and i think you guys should do

816
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,799
that too before you hire someone in the

817
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,918
security field you should probably do

818
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,960
your own background

819
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,799
because you're going to look kind of

820
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,159
silly if a client brings it to your

821
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:31,760
attention that

822
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:33,200
of what a potential employee is doing so

823
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,879
it also it's a really good thing to see

824
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,120
what the internet has about you right

825
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,480
it's a lot of cool things um again you

826
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,719
can look up by yourself

827
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,000
look up on me or whatever i mean it's

828
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,200
all out there so

829
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,039
it's something to look at and see what's

830
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,159
kind of available and kind of go from

831
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,840
it's really interesting

832
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,159
if you guys haven't used it man i highly

833
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,879
recommend it um here's another shot of

834
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,840
it

835
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,679
this is one on a span of a of a network

836
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,120
this is us putting in some ip addresses

837
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,080
or even a company name

838
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,199
it quickly spans the internet you got

839
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,360
ftp

840
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,360
ftp sites you have their windows

841
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,678
accounts you have their 365s

842
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,520
you have the um the websites that are

843
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,799
authorized and classified to that

844
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,279
company

845
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,918
you have um all kinds of stuff i mean

846
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,320
there's

847
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,440
also um exploits that claim that they

848
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,240
may have been associated with the

849
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,799
company

850
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,360
um you have list serve drops all kinds

851
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,440
of stuff

852
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,199
um i hope that you guys are uh currently

853
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,279
using this tool if not it you should

854
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,919
it's really cool oh also rdps

855
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:32,080
i have open rdps you're going to go back

856
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,520
remote desktop protocol

857
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,918
that's the tool that you use just from

858
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:39,440
windows to remote into a machine

859
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:41,760
it'll also verify if the guest the guest

860
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,799
is still available which if you still

861
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,039
have guests on your

862
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:46,799
computer machines please disable it

863
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:48,799
because people still today have the

864
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,799
guest

865
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:52,080
user enabled which is which is insane

866
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,240
but again going back to

867
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,480
you don't have to be super crazy like

868
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,880
hackerman um just knowing how a computer

869
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,000
works

870
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,919
it would be great now i'm going to give

871
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,520
you uh one other cool

872
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:04,080
uh like thing about like just knowing

873
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,200
computers i was working for a financial

874
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,918
institution

875
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,600
and uh you guys will love this uh if you

876
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,720
guys we were scanning a port and i

877
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,080
forget which one it was i think it's

878
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,159
like one two three four

879
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,678
um it was a it was an old it was an old

880
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,320
one called uh you guys remember net

881
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,240
meeting

882
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,439
like again i'm aging myself now this is

883
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,960
way back in the day

884
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,720
so there's net meeting port and this

885
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,240
actually was open on this

886
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,760
financial institution what they had done

887
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,559
is they had actually merged with another

888
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,840
company

889
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,520
and they needed someone to go through

890
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,199
and check their vulnerabilities now is

891
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,440
that a vulnerability

892
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,960
in itself no it's not it's a it's a port

893
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,440
it's an open thing that you can touch

894
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,760
right

895
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,520
so what we're able to do is um since it

896
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,200
was actually a windows 95 machine

897
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,039
obviously a lot of exploits for that

898
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,559
um so i had to go back and use the old

899
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,158
school netbus if you guys don't know

900
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,360
what that is that's some super old stuff

901
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,960
but it was fun right

902
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,399
but just knowing that just being in that

903
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,840
when i was like a little kid

904
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,600
knowing that information can bring it

905
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,120
and so this was like three years ago

906
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,360
i'm just knowing that information being

907
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,000
in it that makes a really good pen

908
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,120
tester

909
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,320
it's not so much it's not so much the

910
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,918
skills you have

911
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,559
it's the knowledge you have about the

912
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,919
systems the environments networking

913
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:10,799
and how you would actually perform

914
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:12,960
security so again my soapbox

915
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,000
okay scanning and vulnerabilities what

916
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,880
does that mean

917
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,640
okay that's what i got here um why do we

918
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,240
scan an environment well we scan it

919
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,000
this is different so we do port scanning

920
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,399
i talked about that way earlier

921
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,120
uh vulnerabilities um man it's it's

922
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:27,520
there's so many

923
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,320
out there uh i forget the one and and

924
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,760
shame on me

925
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,520
i always call it green bones but that's

926
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,360
not what it's called open vos

927
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,960
i was green bones like the old one has

928
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:38,080
the the green helmet guy whatever

929
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:39,279
the dinosaur anyway um so yeah so you

930
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,199
got to scan why because there's

931
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,480
vulnerabilities uh there's cvs out there

932
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,080
that you don't know about and why would

933
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,000
you that doesn't make any sense so

934
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,760
you have automated tools we've already

935
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,159
done the exposure the intelligence when

936
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,760
you do

937
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,760
and then you do an automated search

938
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,640
again for vulnerabilities that may or

939
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,399
may not be

940
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,559
in that environment it saves you a ton

941
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:57,918
of time i say this all the time is one

942
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:59,678
scanner good enough

943
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,440
absolutely not i don't know why you

944
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,480
would do that if you have access to use

945
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,320
multiples

946
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,080
i mean i know time and when you get like

947
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,678
a company a business they may

948
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,439
want you to use a specific one because

949
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,640
it's been approved by change control and

950
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,320
that's super boring

951
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,000
but then if you just use that one then

952
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,200
you know use your port scanning yourself

953
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,440
because a lot of those

954
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:22,720
vulnerability scanners nessus qualis

955
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:25,679
all the main ones they typically don't

956
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,520
scan all ports unless you specify and i

957
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:30,559
feel like that's the coolest part

958
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,639
is scanning just manually even in nmap

959
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,760
that you can kind of scan and you can

960
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,240
get your own

961
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,520
basic call your own data again not

962
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,039
practical

963
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:42,399
single scan next step vulnerability is

964
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,000
found now what so we talked about

965
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:45,520
vulnerability so vulnerability

966
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,279
again i'm being super generic i know a

967
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,440
lot of you guys know this right so it's

968
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:51,200
it's something it's a it's an

969
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,960
it's a way that you can gain some type

970
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,960
of access from a computer

971
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,720
it's a way that you can get inside or

972
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,919
maybe to inject code

973
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:02,080
modify gain access to a device

974
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,520
that's really what a vulnerability is

975
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,039
and again i kind of already went through

976
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,840
multiple ways to get it's not just

977
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,080
scanners

978
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,279
it's intelligence it's the company's

979
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,799
exposure

980
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:12,960
it's people that have worked for it

981
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,480
because again everyone thinks that

982
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,080
computers vulnerable well that's super

983
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,600
cool but what about the people right

984
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,960
how vulnerable are the people that's a

985
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,080
huge vulnerability that's a big one

986
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,360
again i go back to the

987
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,120
everyone's all about these phishing

988
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,320
emails but what about voip you know a

989
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,918
voice

990
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,600
been able to convince people to do stuff

991
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:29,360
over the phone is that a vulnerability

992
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,719
absolutely so we're not just doing the

993
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,559
scanning we're also collecting

994
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,960
all vulnerabilities from the human

995
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:36,960
aspect from the physical door aspect

996
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,559
which we talked about earlier and also

997
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,919
from the computer asset because i feel

998
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,520
like a lot of people when they do a pen

999
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:42,080
test they're so just like in this little

1000
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,360
box

1001
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,279
plus you guys don't like to talk to

1002
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,799
humans i get that man i ain't i don't

1003
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:48,720
about that either but

1004
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:50,080
that stuff's exhausting that's why we

1005
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,520
work with computers but like

1006
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,279
like you have to realize like what's a

1007
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,440
real vulnerability you're you're

1008
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:58,159
limiting your scope when you only think

1009
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,200
that a vulnerability is just a computer

1010
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,279
so

1011
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,799
upset about that okay and then another

1012
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,240
thing i always recommend

1013
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:06,000
if you guys are helping a client out you

1014
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,960
got to do like another 30 days so after

1015
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,640
you help them

1016
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,080
you help them and you kind of hack in or

1017
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,799
even if you're helping you know your own

1018
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,360
network

1019
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:14,158
um what i love the best is when you

1020
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,799
provide

1021
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,240
a cool rapport to an i.t guy and then he

1022
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,840
gets super upset

1023
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,200
and then he gets really mad and he's

1024
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,799
like this dude he puts on his power

1025
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,240
glove because he's so upset and he knows

1026
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:26,320
way more than you because he's been

1027
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,559
working in the field since whatever

1028
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,678
um just scan it 30 days later and see if

1029
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,960
they actually fixed it because it

1030
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:31,919
happens all the time they always say

1031
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,120
they fixed it

1032
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:35,440
and they don't and that's not what it's

1033
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,678
about

1034
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,279
pen testing is about helping somebody to

1035
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,440
secure their environment

1036
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,960
business-wise otherwise that's different

1037
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,679
but i'm saying like you guys that you

1038
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,919
know work

1039
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,360
have a full-time job um that's your job

1040
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:48,399
your job is to secure the environment

1041
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,479
it's not there to

1042
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:51,600
to make people happy or whatever just

1043
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,200
tell them the truth

1044
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,879
we worked we talked to robots the robot

1045
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,080
said you were vulnerable so fix it

1046
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,440
and then i'll ask the robot if you're

1047
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,559
vulnerable again and they'll probably

1048
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,240
say yes or no so

1049
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:02,840
it's it's pretty simple i feel like that

1050
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,559
gets pretty confusing to business as

1051
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:06,879
well

1052
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:07,678
okie dokie this is an example of an open

1053
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,760
boss scan

1054
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,279
see i forgot it's in my my presentation

1055
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,679
here um and oh by the way

1056
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:15,279
guys this is free so um if you have

1057
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:18,240
never used it please do

1058
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:19,519
before you scan make sure that you

1059
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,320
update your signatures

1060
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:23,360
all the time and secondly be careful

1061
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,678
what you scan

1062
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:28,158
according to the court i believe last

1063
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:31,200
scanning is not a crime

1064
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:34,480
but gaining access or modifying anything

1065
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,120
is so that's up to you so i recommend

1066
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,000
doing all

1067
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,799
testing inside a own your own private

1068
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,720
network

1069
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:42,240
but yeah yeah so this is free so you

1070
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,279
guys should check it out um there's a

1071
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,720
lot of stuff out there

1072
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:47,679
um it's it's it's heavily uh i would say

1073
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,399
updated by the

1074
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:50,880
the openvos team and and thank them for

1075
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:53,039
um

1076
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,399
for being a part of the security uh

1077
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,279
world because you know a lot of people

1078
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:58,399
need to learn and

1079
00:31:55,279 --> 00:32:00,480
not everyone has enough money to buy um

1080
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:02,320
a scanner so i think it's a good good

1081
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,760
part to donate to that and i i

1082
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,240
appreciate them for doing that so if you

1083
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,158
guys haven't

1084
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,600
ever seen what that looks like it looks

1085
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,880
like this so that you guys might want to

1086
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,760
check that out

1087
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,120
okay another cool one if you guys do not

1088
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,360
know what nmap is

1089
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,360
welcome to the internet uh nmap has been

1090
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:20,320
around forever

1091
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:22,158
nmap is a scanning tool um again it's

1092
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,519
more automated but what i love the best

1093
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:27,039
this is actually my favorite one

1094
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:27,519
is not only can you scan a full subnet

1095
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:30,480
meaning

1096
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:32,240
uh you plug into a network you get an ip

1097
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,679
address and you can scan from one to two

1098
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,000
five five or whatever

1099
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:37,279
the network architecture is uh what i

1100
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,159
also love about this there's a lot of

1101
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:42,159
vulnerabilities you can obtain from this

1102
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:44,000
um when you have the scanners you have

1103
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:46,640
to realize is that they're really loud

1104
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,760
um when we do uh the red team stuff

1105
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,080
again i appreciate

1106
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,440
me qualifying that when we do a red team

1107
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,639
uh one

1108
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,279
um we will not use a scanner like a like

1109
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,360
a

1110
00:32:55,279 --> 00:33:00,320
nessus or an open boss because it is too

1111
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,600
loud uh what i realized in the past is

1112
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,439
when you make obviously you don't make

1113
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,039
enough noise especially if an ids

1114
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,039
an intrusion detection system or

1115
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:08,640
intrusion prevention system gets you

1116
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:10,559
then you're going to be blacklisted and

1117
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,960
your ip address will be banned

1118
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:14,559
and then the in the event is over and

1119
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,720
then you're super sad because

1120
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,600
you lost and whatever you got you got

1121
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,640
the blue team won

1122
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,600
so what i recommend is i call walking it

1123
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,480
so

1124
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,360
you can slow down and in map by the way

1125
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,840
nmap is a

1126
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,639
you can use a cli this is a picture of

1127
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,959
zenmap

1128
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,559
who people who don't have um we'll say

1129
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,640
uh command line interface

1130
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:36,000
uh skills or terminal skills i know

1131
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,360
there are some people out there i know

1132
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,279
probably a lot of you like terminal

1133
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,879
stuff like that but there is zen map

1134
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:42,960
which is basically the gui

1135
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,039
um insert for that i will let you guys

1136
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,679
so the example here

1137
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:49,519
just scanning uh an asus router it lets

1138
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:51,120
me know what ports are available on that

1139
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:51,519
i'm looking i can't point to it but it's

1140
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:55,678
80

1141
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:56,080
53 8443 i only point those out because

1142
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,679
that's

1143
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,600
it's an odd port someone may know what

1144
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:00,960
that is but that's an easy way to jump

1145
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,678
in there and say man that's a weird port

1146
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,120
what is that

1147
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,559
again just go to google figure out what

1148
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,719
part it was and see how to connect to

1149
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:08,159
that terminal

1150
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,918
and when i say what going back to the

1151
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:12,960
walking statement is um

1152
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:13,679
when you use a scanner it usually will

1153
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,119
scream

1154
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,720
let's just say you did the the basic

1155
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:20,000
port so i think it's like one to one

1156
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:21,359
or 1024 right port 1024

1157
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,639
and it just shoot like all those

1158
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,319
sessions say hey i need all this

1159
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,760
information it'll be scream right in the

1160
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,879
face of that machine and it'll do it

1161
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,240
through the whole network

1162
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:30,078
but this one you can actually slow it

1163
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:33,118
down and say it's port one open

1164
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:35,440
or two three four

1165
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,399
and you get it all the way to sixty five

1166
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,159
thousand whatever

1167
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:39,679
sixty five thousand i forget but you

1168
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,639
guys when you can do that that's

1169
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:43,918
actually keeps it uh

1170
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:46,720
low profile and typically ids ips

1171
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:48,078
systems will not uh utilize this type of

1172
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:51,118
transaction because

1173
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:52,960
it's not loud it does take more time

1174
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,480
but if the point of the red team is

1175
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,200
actually breach control

1176
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,720
and not be caught this is a way to do it

1177
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,520
and it's so funny because it's an old

1178
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,240
tool

1179
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,839
and again how you can subvert this which

1180
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,598
we have done for other clients is

1181
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:07,279
no one should be running this ever so if

1182
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:08,720
there's like any type of user agent you

1183
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,680
can ban if it says nmap

1184
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:13,200
probably should ban it um or any type of

1185
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,598
use of a scanner

1186
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,279
inside of a it will say the finance

1187
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:19,040
group why is someone using it in the

1188
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:22,640
finance group you can write blue team

1189
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:23,839
tools and uh and also snort rules for

1190
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,960
this stuff that's a whole different

1191
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:25,839
discussion i was kind of bringing that

1192
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,440
full scope on

1193
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:28,960
how the red team can encourage and help

1194
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,520
the blue team learn so if you guys don't

1195
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,040
know what

1196
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,599
that is if you can't use command line

1197
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,320
interface uses nmap um it's easy peasy

1198
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,320
okay

1199
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,880
all right you guys ready it's hackman

1200
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,760
time um all right so we talking about so

1201
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,160
cali

1202
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,000
um if you're super old use backtrack and

1203
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:46,000
i'm gonna make fun of you forever

1204
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,839
um and we can hang out and we can talk

1205
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,079
about the good old days so

1206
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:51,279
cali linux is a debian based linux

1207
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,280
distribution aim

1208
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,119
at advanced penetration testing and

1209
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,520
security auditing

1210
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,640
okay what this is is so i'm not gonna go

1211
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,599
through this because i feel like there's

1212
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,240
probably like eight

1213
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:03,440
other like presentations on cali but i'm

1214
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,799
gonna tell you this is the tool that you

1215
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,920
use when you find the vulnerabilities

1216
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,680
and i'm just kind of explaining this for

1217
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:10,079
people who who may not be aware right

1218
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,759
so let's go back we're doing a red team

1219
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,359
uh we found intelligence

1220
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,680
the intelligence brought us into a

1221
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:16,400
company uh we were able to get into a

1222
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,319
port

1223
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,240
that we found we'll say again just port

1224
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:23,839
22 we use the

1225
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:25,118
metasploit tool in cali and it'll do a

1226
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:28,240
scandal say hey this

1227
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,720
ftp server is vulnerable to x then you

1228
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,598
use the

1229
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:33,279
uh the executable or the uh the uh when

1230
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:35,359
you execute the uh

1231
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,119
whatever execute on the machine that way

1232
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,680
you can take full control so you can use

1233
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:39,200
basic

1234
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,799
other hacking techniques this is more of

1235
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,680
a i would say a full access

1236
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,040
granting taking control of that if you

1237
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,839
guys again i don't talk about cali too

1238
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,200
much but

1239
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:49,440
using those different exploits that you

1240
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:51,680
can download um

1241
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,280
is a good place to start there's so many

1242
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,399
resources out there

1243
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,640
again i highly recommend just

1244
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,720
downloading a windows xp machine

1245
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,400
and put on your network and start using

1246
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,240
again you can run the scanners against

1247
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,400
it you can find what's vulnerable to

1248
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,319
and you can use those exploits from

1249
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,000
metasploit to take over machine and gain

1250
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,000
full access

1251
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,839
um the next part of this presentation is

1252
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,920
going to be probably pretty quick

1253
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:15,359
but i won't let you guys know like um

1254
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,480
kind of using like you don't have to be

1255
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:18,240
super hacker man

1256
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,680
i know a lot about you know linux and

1257
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,959
stuff like that to be a good hacker i'm

1258
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,598
just going to give you guys a few

1259
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:26,079
examples just knowing technology

1260
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:26,800
um to to kind of basically take over a

1261
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:29,359
company

1262
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,079
and again you guys can do this at home

1263
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:32,799
all right so

1264
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:34,560
this first example is um what i was able

1265
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,119
to do uh this is again

1266
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:38,960
this is a printer no one cares about

1267
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:40,320
printers this is so stupid i don't want

1268
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,800
no one wants a printer right

1269
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,160
what a printer does is it usually has

1270
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,000
email addresses right so

1271
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,399
if you can exploit a printer address

1272
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,520
with the the magical password of admin

1273
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,119
admin

1274
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,119
was able to gain control of this printer

1275
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:55,359
and it had a full list of every

1276
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:56,880
uh employee in the company okay that's

1277
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,920
super cool so i was able to get that

1278
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,520
information

1279
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,440
and then i was able to start then we

1280
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,240
actually planned a an email attack on

1281
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,320
the side

1282
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:06,319
at this same course is we were able to

1283
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,800
also get um access since we had

1284
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,720
admin access to the printer um every

1285
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,400
email that was sent to that printer

1286
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,560
we had it x filled we put a forwarding

1287
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,119
rule anything that was scanned into the

1288
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,880
machine

1289
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:18,320
we forwarded outside the company and we

1290
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,079
were able to exfil the company

1291
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,359
through multiple pii and stuff obviously

1292
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:22,640
we're hired to do this this was an

1293
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:24,240
ethical engagement

1294
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,680
what i'm saying is a lot of people think

1295
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,118
that hacking is like

1296
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,560
you know using you know the metasploit

1297
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,440
tool which again i agree with that i

1298
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,359
think that's great

1299
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,040
but just knowing that a stupid printer

1300
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:34,960
if you just typed in the model name and

1301
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,079
typed in default password this stuff is

1302
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,400
still out there

1303
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:40,000
these screenshots are not that old um

1304
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,680
even you know i would say even a month

1305
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,160
and a half ago i was able to get into a

1306
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,520
printer

1307
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,920
and do the exact same thing which was

1308
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:47,359
even cool because i set up smtp on it so

1309
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,280
i made it a mail server

1310
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:50,720
just to send out my mail and my messages

1311
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,640
from the printer that way

1312
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,640
if anything came back to me as the

1313
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,839
hacker it actually would come back to

1314
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,680
the company and they would get the

1315
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:59,200
letter from the fbi and that's a whole

1316
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,598
other thing

1317
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,759
um this is a really cool thing so we

1318
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:05,839
talked about just ip scanning

1319
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,560
what i was able to do just using a

1320
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:10,640
scanning tool uh what i had found is

1321
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,320
again i was on site i was able to just

1322
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,240
run my scanning tool i was able to

1323
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,839
identify a solarwinds box

1324
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:18,078
and again just using the default

1325
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:19,599
credentials i was able to

1326
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,960
someone set up a solarwinds box and i

1327
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:22,000
had asked the client said hey you have

1328
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,880
solarwinds they said

1329
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,400
absolutely not but what someone did who

1330
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,040
used to work there and this is typically

1331
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,520
it's just i

1332
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,720
t you know neglect from the network i

1333
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,880
was able to find

1334
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,240
all their entire network to the entire

1335
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,920
company within five minutes because

1336
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:38,078
someone was super generous

1337
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,599
and was able to put every subnet in

1338
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:41,520
their solarwinds product that was

1339
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:43,280
hilariously expired but it was still

1340
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,079
running on a box that they had no idea

1341
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,520
about

1342
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,040
that's super cool that's quick

1343
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,000
reconnaissance and that was quick take

1344
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,839
over the company

1345
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,320
that wasn't crazy hackerman i always

1346
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:53,680
think people especially artfield are

1347
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,079
super intelligent but i think they

1348
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:57,520
always overthink everything and

1349
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:58,960
sometimes you just got to take a breath

1350
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,160
and just take a step back and just kind

1351
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:03,599
of keep it simple

1352
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,960
as you run into you know difficulty then

1353
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,440
you can start turning up the the you

1354
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,520
know

1355
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,839
running scripts and and maybe running

1356
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:11,440
custom exploits and stuff like that but

1357
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:12,720
again this is you know if i started

1358
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,920
running exploits you know custom

1359
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,879
exploits i would have totally missed

1360
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,280
this had i not just run

1361
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,800
just a just a port scan right pretty

1362
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,319
cool

1363
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,760
um again i talked about this one uh ftp

1364
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:25,680
that was open

1365
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,880
what i was able to do was we were able

1366
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:29,520
to just

1367
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,960
anonymously log into this no password

1368
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,800
filezilla it's free

1369
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,400
and we're able to actually put execution

1370
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,440
code on this and

1371
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,000
take over a box so again having right

1372
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,880
access to

1373
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,280
a machine via ftp because it was open

1374
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,920
and they

1375
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,520
quote don't use ftp in their company

1376
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,720
what that means is we shouldn't be using

1377
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,960
it and i don't know

1378
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,839
um who is actually doing it typically

1379
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,160
what that means

1380
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:52,880
again doing something super simple

1381
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,520
taking over

1382
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:57,280
a client executing something ftp because

1383
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,400
we had a read write access

1384
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,119
we're able to take control of that

1385
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:03,680
machine and kind of move along

1386
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:04,960
um and then uh kind of again keeping it

1387
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:07,200
simple

1388
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,319
just getting into so this was this was a

1389
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,160
vault

1390
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:12,640
that no one had ever seen ever in their

1391
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:15,759
life uh but that was what they said

1392
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:17,359
were able to scan the network uh i was

1393
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,200
actually when i did a scan

1394
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:20,799
i found this port that this uh this

1395
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,359
camera was running on

1396
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,240
i put the port in google just being

1397
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:27,040
super generic

1398
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:28,319
i was able to pull in uh what what tool

1399
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,000
runs on that

1400
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:32,079
i found out what vendor it was

1401
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,119
downloaded the application tool to

1402
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,560
authenticate with it

1403
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:37,040
it was all default credentials were

1404
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:38,720
default so i had like a i had like the

1405
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,319
this was the server i was the host i

1406
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,359
installed everything default and then i

1407
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:42,160
was able to connect to it and

1408
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,598
authenticate

1409
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,560
and i was able to see in their vault

1410
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:45,920
there have been people that have worked

1411
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,119
in there for eight years who had never

1412
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,720
seen inside this room

1413
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:50,400
and we were on site for just a little

1414
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:54,240
bit i was able to see so

1415
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:56,079
pretty cool um okay also

1416
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,680
if you guys uh this is this is more of

1417
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:00,079
the the metasploit this is

1418
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,680
not as as cool as it used to be because

1419
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:03,520
it's kind of played out but again

1420
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:06,240
if you guys there's a full instructions

1421
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,440
on the smtp open relay

1422
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,279
um this is something that has been

1423
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:12,000
available externally

1424
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:13,520
um people put the owa remember they

1425
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,560
remember that for outlook and people are

1426
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,280
trying to move away from that but

1427
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,680
there's still

1428
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:19,520
multiple out there and you can even go

1429
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,960
to showdown and type in owa there's

1430
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,000
still a lot of sites that are available

1431
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:25,359
to this

1432
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,720
if you kind of look it says mail from

1433
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:29,279
it says kenyon kenya prince

1434
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:31,118
kenyaroom.com

1435
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,280
we sent it to the guy who who brought us

1436
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:34,960
on and if you look at the subject it was

1437
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,440
nigerian prince needs your help and i

1438
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,599
said yo

1439
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,880
i said hey bro please send my bitcoin

1440
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:40,800
wallet can you conference

1441
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,079
and i said i will expect uh to hear from

1442
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:45,440
you with respects

1443
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:47,599
and irregardless which i try to be funny

1444
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,800
another thing we use this on again this

1445
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:50,240
was something that was open

1446
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,240
and the cool part about this one i'm not

1447
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,160
going to go too deep into it but

1448
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:56,078
what it does it actually when people

1449
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,078
connect their owa and you don't need

1450
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:00,000
password credentials it actually hijacks

1451
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:02,000
that session and gives you full access

1452
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,920
also at the same time you can download

1453
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,560
all their attachments in their mailbox

1454
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,760
um another client we did this for um i

1455
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,359
actually told their whole team they

1456
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,400
could go take a vacation day because the

1457
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:12,560
guy who hired us

1458
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,680
i hijacked his mailbox and told his

1459
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,319
whole team they could go home on

1460
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,480
vacation

1461
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:19,279
so and he actually let him go home so it

1462
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:21,680
was funny so it was good times

1463
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,960
okay and if you guys are unaware of the

1464
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,560
eternal blue which is

1465
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,000
my sadness that everyone's patching it

1466
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:28,400
it breaks my heart

1467
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,839
this stuff's really not that difficult

1468
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,400
if you use metasploit

1469
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:33,119
there is a walkthrough just on how to do

1470
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,400
this

1471
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,720
i love this one just because in the

1472
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,440
bottom it says when what we were able to

1473
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,399
do is again

1474
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:42,079
scanning the machine found out it was

1475
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,000
vulnerable to eternal blue

1476
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:45,839
run the metasploit tool it's really

1477
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,720
almost that easy but i think a lot of

1478
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:48,400
people

1479
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:50,319
really want to be super hacker man but

1480
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,040
they don't want to actually do their own

1481
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:53,359
research

1482
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,800
i really say but they'll and plus they

1483
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:57,040
don't understand networking and

1484
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:59,119
how well that works um kind of saying we

1485
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:01,119
were able to export it using metasploit

1486
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:02,480
and it said the word win which gets me

1487
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:05,040
super pumped

1488
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,079
um after that um and here's kind of the

1489
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,520
next step so

1490
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:09,119
if you guys don't know what this means

1491
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,480
i'll kind of walk you through it

1492
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:12,400
um i'll tell you because i know you're

1493
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,440
reading it now but um once we gain

1494
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,760
access to the machine

1495
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,480
one of the machines um i made myself a a

1496
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,960
net user

1497
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,839
and it was called alias password is this

1498
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:23,119
a net user

1499
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:24,799
is a user uh agent on or a user profile

1500
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:26,960
on the machine that i actually input

1501
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,240
into the computer i create a username i

1502
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,920
created a password

1503
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,279
and then if you look at the bottom there

1504
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,480
i made it a local group of the

1505
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:35,040
administrators

1506
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,960
this goes back to me knowing how

1507
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,680
computers work making a local myself a

1508
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,079
local

1509
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:42,240
administrator on the box what i further

1510
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:42,960
did um since we didn't have domain

1511
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,879
access

1512
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,400
i know that the the uh typical because

1513
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,160
this was a server that a lot of the

1514
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,680
server admins would log into

1515
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,598
i know that these server admins would

1516
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,640
have probably domain access so i put in

1517
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:54,079
a booby trap

1518
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,279
we put in uh if you guys aren't familiar

1519
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:56,640
with this we put into booby traps so i

1520
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:00,160
put in a batch file

1521
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:02,240
that when when x logs in i put the batch

1522
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,440
file in the startup file for all users

1523
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:06,240
so when they log in

1524
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,760
it makes the alias account a domain user

1525
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,959
for the entire company

1526
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,800
which they did because they had

1527
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:13,119
maintenance because it was patch tuesday

1528
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:15,200
gave us domain access that way and we

1529
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:16,880
were able to take over the whole company

1530
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,240
so again just knowing how a computer

1531
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,720
works you don't have to be super hacker

1532
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,319
man

1533
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:22,399
i just kind of wanted to share those

1534
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:23,839
different um examples

1535
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,520
and let you guys know that if you're

1536
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,160
kind of wanting to get into it i highly

1537
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,759
recommend it

1538
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,359
you don't have to be again the extreme

1539
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,960
code or something like that

1540
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:32,640
there's always a way just understand how

1541
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:35,280
computers work and maybe just don't

1542
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:36,960
think too difficult about it

1543
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,400
was oh i was showing you that i was able

1544
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,880
to get into the machine yeah

1545
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:42,000
get get access here so i made myself an

1546
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,720
admin account

1547
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,920
i was able to log in and take control of

1548
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:50,078
the machine uh some takeaways

1549
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,359
um we'll see here exposure intelligence

1550
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:53,440
it kind of brings it down to this

1551
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:55,040
um we talked about that like you know

1552
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,319
see what see what this client see kind

1553
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,920
of what you're working even your company

1554
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:59,520
well what are you guys exposed to

1555
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,520
have you ever looked on paceman for your

1556
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:03,680
company ever looked for your name on on

1557
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:05,200
the company have you used multigo

1558
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,480
there's other tools you can use that are

1559
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,520
out there that have some really good

1560
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,760
intelligence

1561
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:12,160
behind them big fan scanning and

1562
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:14,880
vulnerabilities we talked about openvos

1563
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:16,319
uh nmap please use those um those are

1564
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,400
the greatest things in the world

1565
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:20,160
depending on the objective of your of

1566
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,319
your goal if you just want to scan and

1567
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,920
check vulnerabilities i use openvos

1568
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:25,279
if you want to do maybe more pinpointing

1569
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,720
and maybe see if there's some oddity

1570
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,800
ports open

1571
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,919
you can do a port scan enter ip address

1572
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,880
do a drop down

1573
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,440
and collect um select all ips are all

1574
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,880
ports

1575
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,520
and it'll give you a cool run down to

1576
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:39,680
that hacker time i talk about

1577
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,960
understanding metasploit once you find

1578
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,000
the vulnerability that's when you can

1579
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:45,359
start executing

1580
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,880
um executing on the box and see if you

1581
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:48,160
can take control there's so much stuff

1582
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,680
that's released all the time

1583
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:52,560
there's a few companies that are really

1584
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:54,078
behind the metasploit development

1585
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,599
and if you do have some questions the

1586
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:56,720
communities i feel like is always there

1587
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:58,400
to help

1588
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,680
as for myself if anyone ever has any

1589
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,119
questions about stuff like that i'm

1590
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:03,680
always down to help it's not too

1591
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:05,599
difficult to find me on the interwebs

1592
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:07,520
shoot me an email whether it's about

1593
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:09,040
blue team or something you're seeing a

1594
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,240
red team or any of that stuff i do like

1595
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,200
to help and that's why i really like to

1596
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:14,319
participate in

1597
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:16,000
as much b-sides as possible and then

1598
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:17,520
again after you you know you show you

1599
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,480
know whether your boss or whatever

1600
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,400
yourself

1601
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,599
that you're able to fix it from an i.t

1602
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,880
perspective

1603
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:24,559
make sure you rescan that way

1604
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,839
everything's actually secure and when

1605
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:27,520
you actually put your seal of approval

1606
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:29,920
on it it is completed

1607
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:31,680
and then at the end good luck have fun

1608
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:34,079
for all you gamers out there

1609
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:36,000
and then that's the end i'm definitely

1610
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:36,800
here to have questions i ended a little

1611
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,160
early but

1612
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,400
if you guys have any questions again

1613
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:42,480
about red team blue team

1614
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,160
purple team incident response

1615
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:46,720
penetration testing

1616
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:48,160
all that cool stuff let me know yeah one

1617
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,359
question that came up well first off

1618
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,200
thanks very much

1619
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:52,720
um one of the questions that came up in

1620
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,960
discord is

1621
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:57,279
what are your thoughts on the use of

1622
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,920
zero-day vulnerabilities during a pen

1623
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,680
test

1624
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,359
and i know that's kind of a holy war to

1625
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:05,279
some

1626
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:08,840
okay uh so i guess the answer is um

1627
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:10,319
so a zero day i would say um did it

1628
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:12,720
[Music]

1629
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:14,079
first thing is did the client want it is

1630
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:16,879
the client aware so

1631
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:18,559
we have had um clients that said you

1632
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:21,440
bring whatever you want so

1633
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:22,400
we're able to create our own oh day you

1634
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,240
know

1635
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,319
exploits because of the infrastructure

1636
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:28,399
they have that it wouldn't be seen by av

1637
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:30,558
or anything typically that kind of

1638
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:32,720
starts moving into the the code

1639
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:34,000
pin test also which also is quick into

1640
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:36,000
the web app

1641
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,760
pen test which is like a new vertical

1642
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
that is really cool to get into

1643
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,920
i use them for burp suite for all that

1644
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,280
um if the client wants it sure

1645
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:45,440
typically they get they get kind of

1646
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,480
pissed off because they're like we

1647
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,400
didn't know about this

1648
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,680
how would we know if we didn't hire you

1649
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,640
wouldn't even exist

1650
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:54,558
um so i guess that would be uh i guess

1651
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:56,160
i'm like 50 50. so if someone wants to

1652
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:57,520
pay me to do it then i'm down if not

1653
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,078
then i probably won't put the extra

1654
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,400
effort in

1655
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:02,319
unless the goal is like i capture the

1656
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,599
flag which i didn't talk about capture

1657
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:06,720
the flag is another

1658
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:10,000
um pen test that you can be

1659
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:10,480
uh used for that says hey we want you to

1660
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,559
get

1661
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,920
access to you know this server just

1662
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:17,440
specifically that server or

1663
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:20,880
domain access or you know we want you to

1664
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:22,400
attack our our you know core switches

1665
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,400
that's a little different so i'm kind of

1666
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,000
50 50 on that one if someone wants to

1667
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,359
pay for us to develop an o day when

1668
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,280
we're on site that's cool

1669
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:31,040
and if they don't then i i wouldn't do

1670
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,160
it just because it's a waste of time

1671
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,920
professionally because we don't we don't

1672
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,319
we don't drop those either so some

1673
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,000
people

1674
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:38,240
and some companies they make money off

1675
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,280
that and that's cool too and sometimes

1676
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:42,399
we we use those

1677
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:43,839
during engagements so so that's a great

1678
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:48,160
uh

1679
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:48,160
talk to us about scope of work

1680
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:52,400
yeah so um that was kind of like i think

1681
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:56,079
that's a huge problem with

1682
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:57,839
uh like our industry um

1683
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:59,440
there's so many i i literally just kind

1684
00:49:57,839 --> 00:50:00,960
of went through like multiple pen tests

1685
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,839
again i'm using the word pen test

1686
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,240
generically

1687
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:05,599
there's web app pen test there is

1688
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:07,759
external pen test

1689
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:09,119
there's network pen test that means

1690
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,520
someone's going to walk you in hand to

1691
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:10,880
hand

1692
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:13,040
and plug you into the network and let

1693
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:14,800
you do their work right there's also

1694
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:16,160
um again we talked about pen testing

1695
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,440
physical pen testing

1696
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:19,118
and you have to talk about social pin

1697
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,760
testing that's where you do the voice

1698
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:22,400
fishing

1699
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:23,920
and the email phishing um people don't

1700
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,040
ever define scope they're like i want a

1701
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,960
pen test i'm like what the hell does

1702
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:28,319
that mean do you want a vulnerability

1703
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,440
scan because it's probably what you

1704
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:30,319
think you're asking

1705
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,760
do you want me to just tell you what

1706
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:32,558
you're vulnerable to like what you need

1707
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,640
to patch

1708
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:36,319
or do you want to try to break in and if

1709
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,440
we do break in do you want to try to get

1710
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:39,040
access control

1711
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,720
and if we do get access control do you

1712
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:42,319
want to try to modify something

1713
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,919
and then all that is something that

1714
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:45,279
needs to be defined when you get into a

1715
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,559
scope because i think

1716
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,319
people when they ask for a pen test

1717
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:49,839
which is good one of our biggest

1718
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:51,440
problems in this industry is no one

1719
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:52,160
really knows what the hell security is

1720
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,079
but now

1721
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:55,440
people understand what a pen test is but

1722
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:57,760
they don't understand there's different

1723
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,720
levels of a pen test and how how far the

1724
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,960
scope can go

1725
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:02,720
because you can get yourself in some hot

1726
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:06,240
water case and point

1727
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:07,279
uh company out of the the area that you

1728
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:10,319
guys are in

1729
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:11,440
was arrested because the scope of work

1730
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:13,279
wasn't uh

1731
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,640
really nailed down and qualified and

1732
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,720
they got arrested for

1733
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,839
um on three felonies they have been

1734
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:20,480
released um

1735
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:22,558
i personally put out a call to drop

1736
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:24,240
those charges well because it was bs

1737
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:25,280
but just saying i i would even though

1738
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,240
they didn't get you know they got

1739
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:28,319
released all stuff

1740
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:29,520
i can't even imagine uh someone in our

1741
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:31,359
field like that just trying to do their

1742
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:34,000
job getting arrested but that was pretty

1743
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:37,279
pretty pretty wild so um i hope i

1744
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,880
answered that question

1745
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,800
right and one of the topics that has

1746
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:44,640
come up in chat a couple times now

1747
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:44,960
is that uh classically if you exceeded

1748
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,279
the

1749
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,720
scope of work you might get your hand

1750
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:51,839
slapped but recently

1751
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:55,279
we saw a pretty uh high profile case

1752
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:57,680
where two pen testers were arrested

1753
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,880
and ultimately it boiled down to a game

1754
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:00,640
of politics

1755
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,880
uh there's a great article in the wire

1756
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:04,558
that goes through the entire story it

1757
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:06,720
actually has body cam

1758
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:08,000
footage of sheriff's talking to him the

1759
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:10,959
whole works

1760
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,160
um and there's more more in the the

1761
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:14,400
discord chat

1762
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:16,240
about others that have been arrested so

1763
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:19,119
definitely something to keep in mind

1764
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:21,040
yeah again this again i even hate to to

1765
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:24,240
bring these knuckleheads into these but

1766
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:25,520
you know um maybe run it by legal

1767
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,359
you know make sure your scope is

1768
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:30,079
understood um

1769
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:31,680
make sure that uh typically um and i

1770
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:33,119
always make sure that um

1771
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:36,480
i have a really good relationship with

1772
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:38,000
the with the client itself make sure

1773
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,440
and if they are super sketchy about it

1774
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,720
you know i have to take a step back and

1775
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,920
you think about that when you guys are

1776
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,359
out there doing this is

1777
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:45,359
if your client doesn't trust you the

1778
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:46,000
security guy then you probably need to

1779
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:47,598
be very

1780
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,880
careful if they're asking you maybe too

1781
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:49,359
much questions about what are you doing

1782
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,800
or where you're

1783
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:52,960
like i mean there's a difference between

1784
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:54,160
asking qualifying a a vendor

1785
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,599
and there's difference between like i

1786
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,879
don't think i trust you i think there's

1787
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:58,000
something going on here you need to be

1788
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,440
very careful because

1789
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,440
uh most likely they're gonna probably

1790
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:04,480
set you up for some type of trap so

1791
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:06,000
um i also recommend we do any type of uh

1792
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,480
if i ever do any exploiting or anything

1793
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,960
like that

1794
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,000
um cali has the record button the video

1795
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,920
button because

1796
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,640
i've even said hey all this stuff was

1797
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,920
vulnerable i give them the report

1798
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:18,160
and they're like this is not vulnerable

1799
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:19,520
this is all fake so then at the end i'm

1800
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,440
like scroll down to the bottom there's

1801
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:23,599
an appendix that has a screenshot and in

1802
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:26,160
the bottom right there is a date

1803
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:28,079
and time so you must have changed it and

1804
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:29,680
i'm not trying to get onto uit guys but

1805
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:31,520
just let me do my job no one's in

1806
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,720
trouble here we're on your side we're

1807
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:34,000
probably going to be better in your

1808
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:35,200
court if you let's do our job because

1809
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,760
then you'll have more money for your

1810
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,118
budget

1811
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,800
plus you can show your boss you're doing

1812
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:39,760
work because we found the vulnerability

1813
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,200
and you fixed it

1814
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,960
i think that's a big huge gap between

1815
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:44,480
the security and the i.t world that

1816
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,000
we need to come together to understand

1817
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:48,079
we're on the same team

1818
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,839
right and see that's a great point i did

1819
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:51,040
contesting for 13 years and one of the

1820
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:53,119
things that we did that i

1821
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:54,240
strongly encourage is that while the

1822
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:56,800
report will carry

1823
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:58,640
some evidence to show what you found and

1824
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:02,000
what you're able to do

1825
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:04,319
make sure that you keep extensive logs

1826
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,680
logs of your shell sessions logs of your

1827
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:09,359
web proxy

1828
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:10,160
log everything keep it for 10 years or

1829
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:12,558
more just

1830
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:13,680
in case someone comes back on you and

1831
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:15,359
has a question

1832
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:16,879
that you can present the full evidence

1833
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:18,240
if needed yeah

1834
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,599
absolutely because you never know

1835
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:21,839
because you know also those companies

1836
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:23,200
you're working for sometimes get traded

1837
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:25,040
and they want to know the security

1838
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:27,680
posture of that business and

1839
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:28,160
you if the contract's in it if they have

1840
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:30,319
a huge

1841
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:32,078
msa that you didn't read um you may have

1842
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:35,359
to produce that during a

1843
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:37,359
a merge or a sell of that business so

1844
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:38,480
keep be very mindful of the contracts

1845
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:40,640
you sign

1846
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:42,160

1847
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:44,558
