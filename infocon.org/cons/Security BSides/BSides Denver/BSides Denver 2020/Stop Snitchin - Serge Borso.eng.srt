1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,120
hello everyone and welcome

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,240
if anyone's ever taken any of my secure

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,559
set online

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,920
python videos or something i have a

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:11,518
reputation for saying that a lot every

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,400
time i start a new video like hello and

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,040
welcome

8
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,560
so anyway my name is serious borso and

9
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,400
i'm here to talk about

10
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,080
snitching especially in the real world

11
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,880
well the real cyber security world

12
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,959
anyway

13
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,160
and the premise of this is really going

14
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,920
to be

15
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:31,439
my own experience of hosting

16
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:34,719
less than reputable websites

17
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,239
and how and why they get taken down

18
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,000
and as a takeaway it's not just me

19
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,120
telling stories it's you know maybe some

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,719
of you are dealing with the same

21
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,718
situations or you're gonna host your own

22
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,000
c2 servers or beef hooks or phishing

23
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,559
domains or whatever

24
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,520
and this may be relevant for you and

25
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,599
hopefully

26
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,360
i can impart some knowledge and walk

27
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,320
away with you know teaching some useful

28
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,079
information

29
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,000
all right so here's me i can actually

30
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,440
google myself now and i got a little

31
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,559
blurb over there on the right hand side

32
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,079
that comes up

33
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,680
so i figured i'd switch over to this

34
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,199
type of descriptor

35
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,040
of myself i've got a

36
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,039
fair amount of history about 15 years or

37
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,479
so in the world of cyber security back

38
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,280
in my day was called information

39
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,119
security

40
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,119
and cyber security was something we kind

41
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,360
of laughed at when we heard come out

42
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,200
but it seems to become much more

43
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,520
prevalent terminology nowadays

44
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,200
regardless once again my name is serge

45
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,240
borso i'm the founder and ceo of

46
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,920
spidersec

47
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,079
and i teach with the sans institute and

48
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,680
i published a book last year i think it

49
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,880
was the penetration tester's guide to

50
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,479
web applications

51
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,640
and i've been doing what i do like i

52
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:39,920
said for 15 years for

53
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,439
large businesses big enterprises

54
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,360
application security network security

55
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,720
system security penetration testing red

56
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,119
teaming purple teaming

57
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,200
so on and so forth all of it and that's

58
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,759
what my company does nowadays i did it

59
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,439
you know for 10 11 12 years for the

60
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,880
industry and now i do it for myself that

61
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,199
is penetration testing

62
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,320
and offering those same type of services

63
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,320
i just mentioned

64
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,559
for companies through my company so

65
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,919
that's a little bit about me

66
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,840
and what i experienced working for

67
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,080
companies and doing what i do nowadays

68
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,920
is

69
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:17,280
among other things fishing

70
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:21,440
and command control and beef hooks and

71
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,680
other things that require a third-party

72
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,480
virtually hosted platform somewhere in

73
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,520
the cloud

74
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,879
quote unquote that can host this

75
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,160
maliciousness and this course is not

76
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,799
malicious if you're doing something like

77
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,680
a

78
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,200
security awareness training campaign or

79
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,120
spearfishing attack and you know you're

80
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,040
doing this for the purpose of

81
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,400
increasing the security posture of the

82
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,840
business you're working for or you're

83
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,239
doing this as some type of

84
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,519
contract work or consulting work for a

85
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,519
company they've hired you

86
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,800
to assess their security you're going to

87
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,000
have a c2 server

88
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,400
you know if you're doing with any type

89
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,760
of callback communications or

90
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,280
you're going to have some spear phishing

91
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,319
websites that you've registered and try

92
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,360
to you know do some credential

93
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,720
harvesting

94
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,480
or delivery of a payload it requires

95
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,000
some external presence out there so as

96
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,000
you're going through this

97
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,440
talk and kind of that's the premise for

98
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,760
this where you're going to be hosting

99
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,359
stuff

100
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,359
and maybe you already are and i

101
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,760
certainly have and that's the background

102
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,000
for this

103
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,599
phishing is prevalent there's a little

104
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,760
maybe a citation needed for that i don't

105
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,920
haven't quantified

106
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,679
but i think we can all agree that

107
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,760
phishing is rather prevalent and i'll be

108
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,840
speaking to kind of that i won't bring

109
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,239
in too much more c2 conversation

110
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,319
or beef because it's almost irrelevant

111
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,720
the point here is that

112
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,920
there is something that you're hosting

113
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,680
on a website

114
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,760
that to the untrained user

115
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,120
or the layperson they're gonna look at

116
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,720
that and say oh that's malicious or

117
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,879
that's suspicious or that's

118
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,159
not normal that's not a regular website

119
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,720
you're doing something bad

120
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,239
or you're doing something whatever and

121
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,799
it's gonna get taken down

122
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,920
so the background is like i said fishing

123
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,280
the company gets hit with a real

124
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,798
spearfishing campaign

125
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,879
they want to get some awareness training

126
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,200
because the people at their company

127
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,518
clicked on that link and now there's a

128
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,798
network outbreak or something bad happen

129
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,080
me i've hosted a lot of

130
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,400
websites i've registered a lot of

131
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,120
phishing domains i'm under 100 but more

132
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,400
than 50

133
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,079
in my lifetime i guess and

134
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,759
when i do this you know i'm doing

135
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,400
awareness training program for a large

136
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,600
client

137
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,320
i register domain i go and you know copy

138
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,199
the theme

139
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,639
from a real website like dropbox.com and

140
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,040
all the different elements and i get an

141
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,880
ssl certificate to make it look real

142
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,080
and i go about you know doing my job and

143
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,520
then i

144
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:38,080
launched my phishing campaign the day of

145
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,120
the campaign was supposed to be sent out

146
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,199
for the client

147
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,960
and all of a sudden my website gets

148
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,120
taken down or it gets take down before i

149
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,320
even send out the phishing campaign

150
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,280
and this has happened to me more than

151
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,599
once

152
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,559
over the years multiple times and it's

153
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,080
annoying it's

154
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,479
money it's time it's effort and if i'm

155
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,440
too stupid to back up my stuff i've i've

156
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,639
lost a lot of time

157
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,800
and money mostly time but time is money

158
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,160
the point here is that my stuff gets

159
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,680
taken down and i want to know what that

160
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,360
is going on so i started doing some

161
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,120
research into this

162
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,919
2017 2018 2019 not not consistent like

163
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,680
i'm spending

164
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,520
you know 40 hours a week doing research

165
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,639
but every time i was going to host a

166
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,960
phishing website

167
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,400
i started paying closer attention to

168
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,479
what was actually going on

169
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,440
and i want to find out who's the snitch

170
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,280
who's targeting me out

171
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:32,800
who or whom is the entity or entities

172
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,239
that is or are causing my websites to be

173
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,880
taken offline

174
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,840
that's the premise for this that's what

175
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,280
i'm trying to talk about and that's why

176
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,919
i'm gonna share with you because i have

177
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,479
found

178
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,000
the smoking gun and at the end of the

179
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,280
presentation i'll share that information

180
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,320
with you but we'll get there

181
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,599
piece by piece so you can read that

182
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,840
for yourself i'm not gonna read the

183
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,240
slides for the most part but i will kind

184
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,400
of

185
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,000
use those to kind of guide this

186
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,719
conversation but that was really the

187
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,360
premise

188
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:03,199
trying to do my job to help companies

189
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,960
increase their security posture by

190
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,639
sending out security awareness training

191
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,400
and phishing and spearfishing campaigns

192
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,120
and then those websites

193
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,239
being taken offline okay and i want to

194
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,800
find out what's going on

195
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,440
so we can look at this and the question

196
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,440
of course is what is it

197
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,719
and those of you looking at the screen

198
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,360
will easily

199
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,759
say well obviously that's dropbox.com

200
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,919
well

201
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,960
yeah it certainly looks like it right

202
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,000
the theme

203
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,440
the colors the font the size of those

204
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,639
input boxes

205
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,600
that's clearly dropbox.com

206
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,440
just like this is clearly amazon.com

207
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,960
there's even a copyright at the bottom

208
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,960
what else could it possibly be that's

209
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,520
definitely the you know the legitimate

210
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,560
real

211
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:50,240
amazon.com and those of us who have

212
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,120
apple accounts that's definitely apple's

213
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,120
website right

214
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,120
well no those are all fishing websites

215
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,479
so what so they're fishing websites who

216
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,479
cares well let's think about it

217
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:07,599
at what point

218
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:10,639
does a legitimate website that you or i

219
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:13,840
go register turn

220
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,599
from just a website into

221
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,919
something that's more malicious and

222
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,880
that's why i got the little caterpillar

223
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,758
turning into butterfly up there it's a

224
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,479
transformation

225
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,240
what happens what makes it just a

226
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,840
legitimate server that's listening on

227
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,599
port 80 or port 443

228
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:34,638
to the

229
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,000
ultimate takedown request that says

230
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,080
someone says hey this is malicious or

231
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,520
this is suspicious or i don't trust this

232
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,400
what what really happens from point a to

233
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,318
point b

234
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,318
that causes something of that to occur

235
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,680
that's a fair question that's what we're

236
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,919
going to talk about so google

237
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,759
your registrar your internet service

238
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,359
provider your hosting provider if you

239
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,360
have a vps if you have aws

240
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,960
or something in the cloud what's going

241
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,520
to cause

242
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,520
them to take action to say i'm going to

243
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,719
suspend your service or disable your

244
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,520
account

245
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,800
or what's happened to me i'm going to

246
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,799
suspend your service

247
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,080
and by the way you just forfeited all of

248
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,000
your credit that you had

249
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,919
prepaid for the next six months

250
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,759
i told you i lost time and money i'm not

251
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,440
joking

252
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,800
let's back up for a second though level

253
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,240
set so what am i talking about here

254
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,840
there's a there's a process that goes

255
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,680
into play and i am by no means

256
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,359
trying to point out these companies on

257
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,200
the slide as you know

258
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,240
good or bad or whatever i'm just giving

259
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,479
you some examples of who you may go to

260
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,680
for your own hosting needs for your own

261
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:44,080
registration needs

262
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:46,479
so you me anyone on this call

263
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,440
who are listening to this presentation

264
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,279
can easily go

265
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,720
and buy or you know lease a domain name

266
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,000
if you have a credit card all you really

267
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,880
have to do is just say i want this

268
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,360
domain

269
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,200
and if it's available and you can afford

270
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,640
it you click a couple buttons

271
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:03,279
and that's pretty much it the registrar

272
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,760
gladly accepts your money and that's the

273
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,959
first

274
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:10,800
point meaning if i

275
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:13,119
am google or i am some

276
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,479
some authority of the web who's going to

277
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,160
have the potential to

278
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,600
launch an abuse notification or a

279
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,560
takedown request

280
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,680
this is the first kind of point where

281
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,079
what you just

282
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,439
created could be scrutinized because

283
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,800
before this you there's nothing out

284
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,680
there you don't have a website you don't

285
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,319
have a website

286
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,680
but now you've gone from zero to you

287
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,279
have something you have a domain name

288
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,719
if it's called evilwebsite.com

289
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,959
is that enough for someone to complain

290
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,160
about it you know maybe but that's not

291
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,680
gonna

292
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,199
that's not gonna hold water when someone

293
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,079
tries to take it down so that's that's

294
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,480
point one though

295
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,080
so if you go to register evilwebsite.com

296
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,200
yeah okay not a big deal probably in

297
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:54,000
most cases

298
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:55,600
if you go to register evildropbox.com

299
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,720
well that's a little bit closer now

300
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,800
you're you're using the name of a

301
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,360
legitimate company in your domain name

302
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,719
and guess what dropbox does pay

303
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,360
attention to that there is typo

304
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,800
squatting

305
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,320
and even though it's not a typo squat

306
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,399
it's still similar enough to where

307
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,480
you're using a legitimate company's name

308
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,320
in your own domain name and that's going

309
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,440
to raise suspicion

310
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,920
one level above nothing so keep that in

311
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,040
mind

312
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,560
the next point point number two a domain

313
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,760
by itself is just sitting there just

314
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,199
because you've registered domain doesn't

315
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,720
mean you have a website running on there

316
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,160
it could be parked but it certainly

317
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,000
isn't your source code or anything it

318
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,160
has to do with anything you've done

319
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,440
other than register a website so this

320
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,800
next point is

321
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,880
you change dns and you point the dns for

322
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,839
the a name

323
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,760
for your domain to an ip address that

324
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,800
can actually host content for you and of

325
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,839
course you could

326
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,040
keep it with the default dns and ip

327
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,760
address and just use the hosting

328
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,839
provider

329
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,279
that you register the main main with but

330
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,360
regardless it's the second point

331
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,480
once you actually have dns pointing

332
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,120
somewhere

333
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,399
and you're hosting content somewhere now

334
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,040
we're talking about

335
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,480
i go to your website it resolves dns it

336
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,480
points me to a website

337
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,839
and my browser renders that page now

338
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,680
that's you know that's the second point

339
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:13,200
that's potentially another

340
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,399
avenue where a company or

341
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,920
someone who wants to take down your

342
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,720
website can say hey this this looks

343
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,959
suspicious

344
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,240
this evil dropbox.com now there's a

345
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,439
domain name and now it takes me to

346
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,760
website

347
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,440
point number two point number three when

348
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,880
i'm creating any type of spearfishing

349
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,560
website or even

350
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,880
even basic security awareness training

351
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,359
websites or c2 servers

352
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,959
anything that i'm hosting nowadays i'm

353
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,920
going to get an ssl certificate for if

354
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,279
it's if there's any type of

355
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,399
communication that

356
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,279
is web-based or needs to be encrypted in

357
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,440
transit

358
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:45,439
and because it's free and it takes very

359
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,079
very limited amounts of effort

360
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,680
although it takes a little bit more

361
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,000
effort than it did a couple months ago

362
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,880
um i'm not gonna get into that but let's

363
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,320
just go ahead and say

364
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,000
ssl search are free there's let's

365
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,480
encrypt and others

366
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,480
like let's encrypt to where it almost

367
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,240
doesn't make sense to not do this

368
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,920
you know when you're going to launch a

369
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,600
phishing campaign you want to make it

370
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,199
look as legitimate as possible

371
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,200
and users have for years have been

372
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,480
trained to look for the https so that's

373
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,360
point number three register an sl

374
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,600
certificate

375
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,720
and we'll get more into why these points

376
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,360
matter in just a moment

377
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,240
the next thing you have a website you

378
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,079
have dns you have

379
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,519
you know domain name ssl cert and now

380
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:25,680
you gotta start copying over stuff

381
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:29,040
perhaps the real theme the real logo

382
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:32,319
the real fonts the real colors all from

383
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,519
the websites you're trying to rip off

384
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,279
or not rip off but you know what i'm

385
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,120
saying like you're gonna copy that theme

386
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,320
i can go straight to dropbox.com right

387
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,680
now

388
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:44,160
using firefox and say file save as

389
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,120
and all that client-side content gets

390
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,959
saved to my machine

391
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,160
and i can upload it and tweak it a

392
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,239
little bit

393
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,000
but essentially upload that to my

394
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,480
phishing website and i've got a

395
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,320
pretty good copy right off the bat of

396
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,760
the real dropbox.com

397
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,680
i'm not picking out dropbox for any

398
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,240
other reason other than

399
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,239
uh they're on my mind right now okay

400
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,360
nothing else special about that

401
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,959
last point here is we've you know just

402
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,880
to reiterate we've registered domain

403
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,719
we've changed dns we're hosting our

404
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,560
site somewhere we have an sl certificate

405
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,839
we have a functional

406
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:20,959
website and now we send out our

407
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,800
actual phishing email to our recipients

408
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,000
at any one of these five points i've

409
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,599
outlined right here

410
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:31,519
those are specific areas

411
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,959
where some company or some human or some

412
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,320
technology

413
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:38,959
could intervene and say this looks

414
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,959
suspicious

415
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,639
of course there's more to it there's a

416
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,480
lot more to it but

417
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,240
don't have time to go into every single

418
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,079
little thing as far as bots and

419
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,360
keys and firewalls and protection and

420
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,760
stuff like that but essentially

421
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,360
it's not too crazy to do all the stuff i

422
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,480
just said that it takes

423
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,399
an hour or so to do that now the

424
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,600
question becomes

425
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,560
at what point during these five points

426
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,639
i've outlined

427
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:12,479
do you think that a website could get

428
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:14,320
flagged as suspicious

429
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,680
and feel free to i'm looking at discord

430
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,160
right now

431
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,279
and i'm happy to you know entertain any

432
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,680
guesses you might have

433
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,519
once you buy a domain is someone gonna

434
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,279
complain about that once you change dns

435
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,519
to get the certificate

436
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,519
once you borrow all the themes from the

437
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,760
real websites

438
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,120
and or once you send out the 50 now at

439
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,600
what point

440
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,600
are you most likely to get a takedown

441
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,120
request or abuse notification or your

442
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,720
registrar is going to say

443
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,000
sorry your account has been served and

444
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,920
your account's been suspended

445
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,680
feel free to think about it i guess it's

446
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,680
more of a rhetorical question

447
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,880
but just to reiterate i am keeping an

448
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,800
eye on

449
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,680
the discord channel and i'm happy to

450
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,279
interact there as well

451
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,760
so just to level set kind of what i'm

452
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,600
talking about

453
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,360
that's the the big red thing you see

454
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,279
right there that's within

455
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,639
i believe google chrome will show you

456
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,360
something that looks pretty much like

457
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,279
that

458
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:14,800
i've obfuscated some of the content here

459
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:16,320
just because like i said this this is a

460
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,399
kind of combination of research i've

461
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,920
done over the years but this research is

462
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:23,680
based off of

463
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,839
me registering real websites for real

464
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,680
customers

465
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,639
that's really have ndas in place so i

466
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,839
don't want to necessarily show

467
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,800
everything but

468
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,720
uh that dropbox.com with the first part

469
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,920
being obfuscated is basically like your

470
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,480
company name

471
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,040
dot dropbox.com or whatever the case may

472
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,040
be

473
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:46,160
and that's what we see when when google

474
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:49,040
and their safe browsing project learn

475
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,000
about your website and they come to the

476
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,719
conclusion that it's

477
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,199
suspect or suspicious or a quote unquote

478
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,240
web

479
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:57,758
forgery or as malicious or whatever this

480
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,560
is what someone sees

481
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,480
do you have any idea how big of an

482
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,719
impact this plays

483
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,000
when you're trying to launch a

484
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,040
spearfishing campaign

485
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,399
to harvest credentials or to get a

486
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,519
foothold into an environment during a

487
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,480
red team engagement

488
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,839
it's a big deal you know i downplayed it

489
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,199
by saying this you know it takes like an

490
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,120
hour to set all this up

491
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,319
but you know i also left out a lot of

492
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,839
complexity there's a lot of

493
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,279
troubleshooting and testing and making

494
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,759
sure that theme looks exactly perfect

495
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,480
and

496
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,240
figuring out what you do with the

497
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,440
credentials once you steal them properly

498
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,040
so on and so forth

499
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,560
so it's a big deal if you go to launch

500
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,680
your phishing campaign and

501
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:36,160
all of a sudden you're like whoa i can't

502
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,399
even get to my website anymore

503
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,759
and my victims aren't gonna be able to

504
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,279
either that's a big deal it's a pretty

505
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,759
big blow to your whole campaign right

506
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,040
there

507
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,480
okay and there's a couple other things

508
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,599
here i got amazonshipping.io

509
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:50,160
trainingmachine.net facebookupdate.com

510
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,000
updatingserver.com those are more

511
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,959
generic ones that i've used

512
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,079
over the years or at least a year i

513
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,839
guess

514
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,120
for what we're talking about phishing

515
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,199
campaigns

516
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,560
and so on and so forth and of course the

517
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,159
middle we're seeing a customer

518
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:07,678
notification that's

519
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:09,360
you know below this email is a phishing

520
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,120
report we've received about your service

521
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:13,198
we expect you to resolve this within 24

522
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:16,239
hours or your service will be suspended

523
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,240
gee thanks thanks a lot where's the

524
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,720
faith in humanity you know i'm doing

525
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:24,079
this for educational purposes not for

526
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:26,480
legitimate harm to people right

527
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,599
at any rate this is based on research

528
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,000
and i'm here to

529
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,199
basically tell you what i learned so

530
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,799
let's kind of

531
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:37,440
take this for what it is what entities

532
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:39,360
are gonna flag websites i said you know

533
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,160
this google safe browsing project and

534
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,479
companies like

535
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,760
dropbox keep keep pretty close tab

536
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,400
sometimes on

537
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,000
similar domains same concept here we'll

538
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,960
start with the first i've highlighted it

539
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,559
in this

540
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,600
pinkish purplish color your registrar

541
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,200
number one

542
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,280
they're not really going to stop you you

543
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,400
know the the registrars

544
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,639
of the world don't necessarily care

545
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,000
about the name of the domain that you

546
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,440
choose to register

547
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,200
you know there's in this country we've

548
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,240
got free speech you can buy whatever the

549
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,679
heck you want

550
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,880
that's perfectly fine even if it's

551
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,720
called this is a phishingwebsite.com

552
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,559
so what they're not gonna be the ones

553
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,559
that's gonna that are gonna argue out

554
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:20,480
let's encrypt the ssl certificate the

555
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,480
certificate provider of choice for

556
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,320
many of us who are just setting up

557
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,880
websites like this

558
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,240
not paying too close attention to the

559
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,480
certificates of issues

560
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,559
meaning if they see a request for this

561
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,440
is a phishingwebsite.com

562
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:36,559
so what once again freedom of speech

563
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,320
freedom of

564
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,639
let's encrypt ssl everywhere type of

565
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,480
thing and that would kind of go against

566
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,160
some core beliefs to just not allow a

567
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,039
certificate based on the name of the

568
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,120
domain

569
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,400
being suspicious or weird or something

570
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,600
like that so

571
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:54,400
once again not a big issue there

572
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,799
based on my experience robots this is

573
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,000
real

574
00:18:54,799 --> 00:19:01,840
there are bots that are scouring the web

575
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,840
on a day hour minutes basis

576
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,918
looking for copyright and trademark

577
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:09,039
infringements that's real

578
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:12,320
and when when i'm copying

579
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:15,520
fedex or ups or amazon shipping stuff

580
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:17,200
and i register domain with their their

581
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,360
name inside of it

582
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,120
that's raises some suspicion and when

583
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,039
their robot goes to that website and

584
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:26,080
they see that there there's actually

585
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:27,440
some logos and themes from the

586
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,879
legitimate website

587
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:33,679
i've gotten dozens and dozens of emails

588
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,360
from those type of companies saying to

589
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,559
take down the content otherwise they're

590
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:40,320
gonna do something legal

591
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:43,600
against me um so keep that in mind

592
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,480
people humans humans that come across

593
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,559
your website

594
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,600
will definitely say this is weird this

595
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,000
is suspect

596
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,918
and they will potentially go there just

597
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,760
using a couple of clicks in the browser

598
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,520
and report it to google report it using

599
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,400
firefox or whatever browser they happen

600
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,799
to use

601
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,320
and say this i think this is a like i

602
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,400
said before a quote unquote

603
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,480
suspected web forgery whatever that

604
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,880
means a suspicious website basically

605
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,760
so people people now we're kind of

606
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,200
getting a little bit farther up the

607
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,158
chain here humans definitely do have an

608
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,600
impact on this

609
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,880
and there actually are other humans that

610
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,760
will look at some of those abuse

611
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,559
requests

612
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,039
and notices and take some action if it's

613
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,840
so

614
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:21,360
warrants it next one you kind of already

615
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:24,158
touched on this that company a

616
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,799
the robots scour the web and that

617
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,000
company

618
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,440
is actually gonna go and see if you're

619
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,400
using their logos and stuff and then

620
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,520
they're gonna

621
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,120
maybe report you or at least send some

622
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,320
email to the abused contact

623
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:38,000
for the whois information

624
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,840
now other stuff that's going to come

625
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,559
into play the endpoint solutions

626
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,639
and the other company here so if you

627
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,480
register a domain

628
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,760
because you're going to do the stuff

629
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,600
we're talking about fishing

630
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,039
or beef hooks or you need to host

631
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,959
something third party and you need to

632
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,799
have a domain name associated with it

633
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,720
you go to your head register that and

634
00:20:54,799 --> 00:21:00,240
then you send out some

635
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,240
phishing email to your victim

636
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:05,679
that's email goes through usually

637
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,280
several layers of filtering there's

638
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,440
you know some email filtering some spam

639
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:12,639
filtering maybe even endpoint detection

640
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,240
perhaps but at least some type of

641
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,960
some email gateway that's going to

642
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,120
scrutinize that and nowadays

643
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,080
because it is 2020 you know this isn't

644
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,879
phishing isn't new

645
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,918
by any stretch of the imagination people

646
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,760
in companies and

647
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,360
a lot of us have gotten kind of a little

648
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,480
bit smarter and they say

649
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,000
well here's a link in this email and i'm

650
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,760
going to do a simple whois lookup on

651
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,120
this and see when it's been registered

652
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,600
and if you registered it like i said a

653
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,600
week ago

654
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:44,080
that email scrubbing solution or the

655
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,760
filter the gateway as a case may be can

656
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,840
easily ascertain that

657
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,280
and then mark that as a suspicious email

658
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,280
send it to spam

659
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,879
or simply quarantine it it doesn't even

660
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,520
come to you or

661
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,840
something quasi like that they'll just

662
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,158
make it so that link isn't even

663
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,799
clickable

664
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,080
so definitely suspect if it's a very

665
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,280
brand new website

666
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,480
and all of a sudden there's a link in

667
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,480
the email points to that brand new

668
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,799
website

669
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,159
next one no reputation meaning you have

670
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,799
a website

671
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,480
he registered it maybe six months ago

672
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,679
but there's a blank page

673
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,600
because you're like i'm getting ready

674
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,400
for this engagement or i'm gonna go

675
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,240
ahead and register

676
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,159
amazon shipping.io because i'm gonna

677
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:25,440
need it at some point

678
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:27,840
then it sits there and nothing is there

679
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,919
and it has no reputation reputation

680
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,559
means it's not good it's not bad

681
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,200
it's not classified it's not no violent

682
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,480
it's not

683
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,720
news it's not a blog it's not

684
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,600
whatever you know it's no classification

685
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,840
reputation

686
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:46,719
that's suspect okay and then of course

687
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,720
if the certificate has the name of

688
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,320
legitimate company in it

689
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,200
that too is suspect and that's different

690
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,918
than the other stuff we've already

691
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,120
talked about

692
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,640
i mentioned let's encrypt and i

693
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,439
mentioned the company in question like

694
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,640
if you're trying to

695
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:01,200
duplicate dropbox.com or amazon.com or

696
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:04,559
apple.com

697
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,640
when you actually register that ssl

698
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:09,678
certificate through let's encrypt or

699
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:13,360
a similar provider there is

700
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:16,240
a log of that and

701
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,799
the more mature companies who have to

702
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:21,039
deal with this you know at scale

703
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,799
they are looking for those in their

704
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:26,080
certificate transparency logs

705
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:28,280
if they can easily query and search for

706
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,280
something that has anything

707
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:32,080
star.apple.com or starapple.com or some

708
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,280
type of

709
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,960
fuzzy query to see if there's any

710
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:40,639
apple.com websites being registered

711
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:43,360
like loginapple.com

712
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,679
and that's interesting now what have i

713
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,000
come across

714
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:50,480
to kind of answer some of the stuff i've

715
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,600
been laying down here so far

716
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:57,440
what i've seen is

717
00:23:53,600 --> 00:24:01,120
number five once an actual

718
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:04,559
email gets sent out

719
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,760
that has the highest likelihood of being

720
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:09,039
flagged

721
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:11,120
so the email gateway that's

722
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,400
usually where it happens at meaning i

723
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,879
can host a website

724
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,840
get the dns pointed over to a hosting

725
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,440
server

726
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,199
copy over all the themes from the

727
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,600
legitimate dropbox or whatever

728
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,559
amazon type of website i'm trying to to

729
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,480
copy

730
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:27,120
to trick users into divulging

731
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:30,400
credentials or or the like

732
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:34,158
and i'm usually okay i can host it

733
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,159
for a matter of weeks

734
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:39,440
what i've come across is it's

735
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,200
typically number five once you send that

736
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,320
phishing email out and it goes through

737
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,320
the gateways

738
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,520
and they're checking all those things we

739
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,200
just talked about

740
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,918
that's where i've had my highest

741
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:53,279
incidence of

742
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:56,159
people humans actually reporting the

743
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:56,960
website as suspicious at that point and

744
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,320
that's

745
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,760
what i found out so i'll show you some

746
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,399
examples here in just a second

747
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,279
but in general that was kind of the

748
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:09,120
first half

749
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:11,440
here so once again

750
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,918
we have a website we have a need to do

751
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,760
some type of

752
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,200
security awareness training or phishing

753
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,480
is part of a penetration test or red

754
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,000
team engagement so we go ahead and

755
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,200
register that website get it all set up

756
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,919
and ready to go

757
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,799
and then send out that email and it's

758
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:28,240
taken offline

759
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:31,679
like quick with the quickness

760
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:33,200
how do we avoid that because

761
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,640
depending on what you do for a living

762
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,360
and what your role is of the

763
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,159
organization

764
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,799
or entity you work for that may be part

765
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,559
of your job

766
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:42,240
and you're supposed to be successful you

767
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,120
know you're the pen tester you gotta

768
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,799
start

769
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,120
trying harder thinking outside the box

770
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:49,039
and figuring out well okay

771
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,719
as soon as i send the email out i my

772
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:54,080
website is taken down

773
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:56,240
and it's the consequences are such that

774
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,600
it's not just like oh that sucks it's

775
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,480
more of a

776
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,279
where were you hosting it was it in aws

777
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,840
because now

778
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,799
your whole amazon account could be

779
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,879
called into question

780
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:09,279
and amazon you want to go talk to aws

781
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,960
about no it's actually a real website

782
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:12,720
that's just hosting for phishing and

783
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,919
i'm actually one of the good guys and i

784
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,960
you know i have a job doing security

785
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,720
awareness training and

786
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,080
yeah that that's not so great and what

787
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,919
if you have other

788
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:22,639
critical assets linked to that aws

789
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:25,520
account they could all get suspended

790
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,960
okay vps virtual private server that

791
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:30,960
hosting company

792
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:32,720
will suspend your whole account i've had

793
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,480
a handful of servers just get taken

794
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,720
offline and they

795
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,960
they never came back you know i

796
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,200
mentioned i briefly alluded to

797
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,880
at the beginning of this money i've lost

798
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,279
where i actually paid for

799
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,960
several months six plus months of

800
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,320
service at a virtual private server

801
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,880
hosting company

802
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,439
and they got one well there's more than

803
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,559
one

804
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,880
but they got they got uh wind of

805
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:58,158
one of my fishing campaigns and they

806
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,279
suspended service and i

807
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:02,799
it was right at a really inopportune

808
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,840
time quite frankly

809
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,279
right in the middle of a fishing

810
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,480
engagement with a client who's paying

811
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:09,120
money for this

812
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,799
and now i look like an idiot and i am

813
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,719
scrambling to get my stuff back up and

814
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,240
running and i've spent money that i've

815
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,080
now got a suspended account and i can

816
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,200
refund my money it's like this is

817
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,678
serious

818
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,960
it's serious on multiple levels so

819
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,399
that's why i'm trying to fail who's

820
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,799
who's the narc who's snitching on me for

821
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:25,360
this

822
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:26,720
because that's that's not cool all right

823
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,760
so what do we do about it

824
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,120
the first one test offline user firewall

825
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,679
what do i mean by this

826
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,399
i mean once you get the domain name and

827
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,320
you register

828
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:38,239
your ssl certificates and you're hosting

829
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,960
it somewhere

830
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,520
leave the firewall turned on white lists

831
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,240
or

832
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,039
allow have an allow list for your ip

833
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,120
address

834
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:48,158
that you're testing from and that way

835
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:51,360
you can see it

836
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:53,679
but any robots that goes there

837
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,399
no connection no tcp connection no

838
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,799
website it's

839
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:58,479
nothing at all it's like it's offline

840
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,760
for anyone else you guys go to the

841
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,559
website while you're

842
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,760
you're in beta testing no one else can

843
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,279
see it so just firewall it off

844
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,480
completely

845
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:08,799
what else second bullet point don't

846
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,039
point

847
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:12,879
website resources to the legitimate

848
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,520
website host it locally what do i mean

849
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,720
by that

850
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:20,240
let me break that down when you go to

851
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:22,799
utilize the theme and the elements from

852
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,240
a legitimate website what i mean is the

853
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:27,440
css files

854
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,760
the javascript files the images

855
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,200
the fonts all that stuff those are the

856
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,360
resources

857
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,240
that comprise any website you go to

858
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,719
right now

859
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,000
when you're copying those from a

860
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,200
legitimate website

861
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,039
there's two different ways to go about

862
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,240
doing this you can just say when someone

863
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:45,679
loads the page

864
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:47,480
that image is located at www.dropbox.com

865
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:49,679
forward slash images forward slash

866
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:53,120
logo.png

867
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:54,240
that's hosted on dropbox.com

868
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,479
meaning when someone goes to your

869
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,520
phishing website or even you when you're

870
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:01,440
beta testing it

871
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:04,639
that image loads from

872
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:08,080
a request that got sent to dropbox.com

873
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:11,600
which directly touches dropbox.com

874
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:13,840
servers hopefully that makes sense

875
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,439
so hosting locally means you copy all

876
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,840
those images once

877
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,840
you go to the website you get the images

878
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:23,918
you get the css files you get

879
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:26,720
whatever it may be and then from there

880
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:29,279
we're talking about you have it locally

881
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,279
on your server

882
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,240
okay i gotta see a couple of people

883
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,799
typing in the

884
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,320
discord channel is it using hash

885
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:40,158
analysis of the images and trying to

886
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,480
search in the css

887
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:43,760
no oh i think he said i think he got it

888
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,880
right so don't point

889
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:48,799
but can they pick up

890
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,080
if you fill the images absolutely they

891
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:53,918
can

892
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:55,840
so the question is we we copy those

893
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:56,640
files locally to our own vps at that

894
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,918
point

895
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:02,480
and could dropbox.com

896
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:04,000
then go and say hey based on this image

897
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,240
you've obviously just cloned it you

898
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,919
copied it yeah definitely but that's

899
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,279
there's no indicator at this point in

900
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:10,159
time if you're hosting everything

901
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,919
locally

902
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:13,120
and some vps you just spun up some

903
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,240
virtual private server that you just

904
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,520
turned on

905
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,679
now we're talking about they have no

906
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,360
indicator to know to go to your vps and

907
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,840
if you're still in the demo beta phase

908
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,120
of this

909
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,959
you have a firewall off anyway

910
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,799
firewalled off meaning no one can even

911
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,399
go to that website to see it

912
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:28,559
so that's what i'm talking about there

913
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:30,639
rackfire45 is typed in something

914
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,600
we'll see what that individual has to

915
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,120
say

916
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,039
in just a moment and i'll address that

917
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:38,799
question or comment thanks doug

918
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:40,240
good call on that all right next one

919
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:42,399
wait until final moment before we go

920
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,440
live to register the certificate what

921
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,639
does that mean and i got a little

922
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,520
asterisks there it can be a negative

923
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,600
reputation

924
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,520
going back to your reputation i

925
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,360
mentioned if you have the reputation if

926
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:54,480
you're specifically your website

927
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:58,719
has a reputation it hasn't uh

928
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:01,200
it hasn't made it to being indexed as

929
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,000
you know trusted or such a blog site or

930
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,120
b9

931
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,640
i guess essentially is what it would

932
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:08,639
come down to without that

933
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:11,760
without you registering a certificate

934
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:13,440
and having it online and ready to go

935
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,600
you're missing on the reputation meaning

936
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,200
if i go register amazon shipping.io

937
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:20,158
which you guys saw

938
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,360
a few slides back that's been up for six

939
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,480
months or a year you guys knew who is

940
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,600
look up on that right now and tell me

941
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,080
how long it's been up it's been up for a

942
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,918
while

943
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,360
and the reputation on that should be

944
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,720
okay because i haven't really hosted

945
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,760
anything out there in a while

946
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,000
so the point here is waiting to the last

947
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,360
minute

948
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,480
can have some negative consequences as

949
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,279
well because you don't you don't build

950
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,559
up

951
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:41,360
that that trust within the whole system

952
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:42,000
so rack fire says he's uh this is good

953
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,439
information

954
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,039
i'm sorry to hear you lost time and

955
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,320
money yeah no problem

956
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:48,399
that's probably what keeping me from

957
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:52,158
going further into the security field

958
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:52,559
yeah i hear you on that pm scientist and

959
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:54,080
i got

960
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:56,879
careful how i pronounced some of these

961
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,918
names question what pros cons exist for

962
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,919
using a site

963
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:02,080
you manage as a reverse proxy to man the

964
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:03,039
middle a simulated site versus copying

965
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,480
the right bits

966
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:07,039
of the simulated site so what problem

967
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,039
can't exist

968
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,760
i gotta think about that happens in

969
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:15,360
anything

970
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:16,960
if something i worry about constantly

971
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,959
something i worry about constantly yeah

972
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,640
um pm science

973
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,559
scientist i'll come back to that unless

974
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,679
i forget another in which case i will

975
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:25,120
come back that for sure i gotta think

976
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:28,480
about that for a second

977
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:31,840
all right other stuff here understand

978
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,279
um in black bold points right there

979
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,120
you gotta figure out what your points of

980
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:36,000
exposure are i highlighted the five main

981
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,479
ones

982
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,559
but there's other stuff out there the in

983
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,960
the maturity level of the company you're

984
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:45,039
trying to

985
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,960
trying to basically trick people into

986
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:48,640
going to like it's not really amazon.com

987
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,760
it's not really dropbox.com it's

988
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:54,720
it's fake dropbox.com

989
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:56,960
if those companies are on their game so

990
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,159
to speak and they're doing things like

991
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,240
typo scouting checks

992
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:01,760
and they're they have their center

993
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,200
policy framework set up properly so you

994
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,879
can't just spoof an email

995
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,640
and other stuff you see on the screen

996
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,279
certificate transparency logs for

997
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,919
instance

998
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:11,519
most companies don't do that i got some

999
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:14,240
i'm not astrix that's like

1000
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:16,159
only some companies are really seriously

1001
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,760
doing this stuff this takes

1002
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:19,200
some automation this takes some humans

1003
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,679
setting it up just takes some humans

1004
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,840
actually

1005
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:23,600
putting the effort into watching what's

1006
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,480
going on as far as typo squatting goes

1007
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,158
just to be clear

1008
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,480
you can't stop someone from registering

1009
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:31,840
amazonshipping.io

1010
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,760
or amazon.photography or amazon dots

1011
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,279
ninja or amazon you can't stop people

1012
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,519
from doing that it's a free country

1013
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:38,880
okay amazon can stop people from doing

1014
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,360
that they can try and they can complain

1015
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,279
about it

1016
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,320
but in most cases it's just something

1017
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,600
you don't have control over so it's

1018
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,879
always going to be that

1019
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,959
subset of people who are going to click

1020
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,840
on that link anyway even though it's

1021
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,799
it's on amazon.com it's amazon.ninja or

1022
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,519
something like that

1023
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:54,720
but there are other areas of exposure

1024
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:56,080
highlighted in this slide right here

1025
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,080
that you need to be aware of

1026
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,279
that could potentially get you exposed

1027
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,158
before

1028
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:03,360
your time is up all right hosting

1029
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,880
platform what do you have to think about

1030
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,000
here this is real this is copy and

1031
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,800
pasted straight from my hosting

1032
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,359
provider and as far as going back to the

1033
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,839
main

1034
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:14,078
theme and question of this whole talk

1035
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:15,599
who's the narc who's snitching on me

1036
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:17,919
you can see right there in yellow and i

1037
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,159
got nothing negative or positive to say

1038
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:21,679
um this is just reality this is research

1039
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,800
and this is me giving it to you in black

1040
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,918
and white

1041
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:29,599
okay this is something that happened to

1042
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:29,598
me back in october 2019.

1043
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:33,759
dropbox abuse detected on your

1044
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,679
infrastructure which is why i was kind

1045
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,720
of harping on dropbox as a

1046
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,520
dropbox.com as a example because i got

1047
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:41,199
hit with it

1048
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,800
i copied all their stuff just like you

1049
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:44,319
saw on the previous slides

1050
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,919
i hosted that did all the stuff i talked

1051
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,639
about and

1052
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:49,839
go to launch the phishing website email

1053
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,320
campaign

1054
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:53,199
then boom hosting provider is like hey

1055
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,679
we got nine

1056
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:56,799
complaints passed from upstream

1057
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:00,160
providers

1058
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:02,160
about phishing so

1059
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,200
yeah there's companies out there that do

1060
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,240
this there's companies out there get

1061
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,359
paid to do this

1062
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:08,319
to protect their customers and it's kind

1063
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:10,400
of ironic

1064
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,760
i'm getting paid to protect that same

1065
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,599
company

1066
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,040
and these people are getting paid to

1067
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:16,640
protect them in a different way to to

1068
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,800
watch out so

1069
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,920
you know there's value in this one way

1070
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:23,040
or the other yeah

1071
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:25,040
i got burned on it but arguably

1072
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,720
they were doing their job not arguably

1073
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,079
they started they were doing their job

1074
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,399
and it just happened to impact me doing

1075
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,800
my job there's no no gray area about

1076
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,040
that

1077
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,920
it's not bad it's not good this is what

1078
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,560
it is but

1079
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,079
there you go so the snitch people i'll

1080
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,119
give you a heads up on this

1081
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:41,280
the second bullet point there

1082
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,720
overzealous i.t administrators back to

1083
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,480
rack fire45

1084
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,078
yeah it's good information you can get

1085
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,359
burned and one of the first times i was

1086
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:49,520
doing this

1087
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:51,119
i remember it was similar to all the

1088
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,280
stuff i said you know

1089
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,560
register domain get the ssl certificate

1090
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,200
set up send out the spearfishing

1091
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,000
campaign

1092
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,040
it looks beautiful looks great and one

1093
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,680
of the it

1094
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,800
admins at the company that received the

1095
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,680
phishing email

1096
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,520
actually went to the who is did like a

1097
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,078
simple who is search on the command line

1098
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:11,440
it's pretty

1099
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:12,560
very easy to do found the abuse contact

1100
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,960
email

1101
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,799
sent down an abuse notification to that

1102
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,440
point of contact at the registrar or

1103
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,119
i think the hosting platform and got my

1104
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,280
website taken offline

1105
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:26,880
in the middle once again in the middle

1106
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:28,640
of the phishing campaign

1107
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,160
so there's other you know there's some

1108
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,078
other pieces that go into this

1109
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:34,399
um communication with the company you're

1110
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:35,280
working for yeah poop squad 420 that is

1111
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,400
an ouch

1112
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:40,800
without a doubt um it got taken i

1113
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:43,040
actually asked that the person

1114
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,480
my point of contact at that customer to

1115
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,680
hey this is what just happened can you

1116
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,520
have your it admin

1117
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,680
you know kind of correct the situation

1118
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:52,000
because we got some issues

1119
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,520
doing this campaign right now it's like

1120
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,880
they're paying me to do this and

1121
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,240
their own personally kind of took it

1122
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,640
offline but that's what it is that's

1123
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:00,240
just reality of it you know

1124
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,839
i used to script the abuse contact when

1125
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:05,839
i was responsible incoming email

1126
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:07,520
yeah yeah technic yep uh technology

1127
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:09,200
that goes back to what we saw kind of in

1128
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,480
the last slide people plus technology

1129
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,399
technology does a pretty good job

1130
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,960
nowadays quite frankly of picking up on

1131
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,520
this

1132
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,960
just based on the the factual

1133
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,240
information how long his website been

1134
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,280
around for

1135
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,240
and the other easy to identify things

1136
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,440
that you could automate

1137
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:26,399
like is there any type of you know known

1138
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,880
history this website

1139
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,440
has a hosted malware in the past uh is

1140
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,240
it

1141
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,839
yeah so on and so forth all right so

1142
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,200
rackfire45 says i'm surprised you

1143
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:37,040
couldn't fight it after the fact

1144
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,319
to at least recover your funding costs

1145
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:42,320
time machine would have helped recover

1146
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:43,839
lost time yeah

1147
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,000
i can't complain too much about it it's

1148
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:48,960
almost like the uh

1149
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,280
the two coal fire guys who got arrested

1150
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,760
for

1151
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,560
doing their job yeah it sucked but when

1152
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,640
it was happening

1153
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,920
around that moment time i'm like yeah

1154
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,118
okay it's not cool at

1155
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,880
this moment in time but i'm sure they're

1156
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:00,240
gonna have a really cool defcon defcon

1157
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,040
talk or black hat talk

1158
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,319
you know and of course they did so same

1159
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,440
thing here i'm talking about it i'm

1160
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,960
sharing my knowledge

1161
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,119
and while i lost some time a little bit

1162
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:11,040
of money you know the reality is

1163
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:13,119
i i got my knowledge i can share with

1164
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:16,400
each of you and hopefully

1165
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:18,880
hopefully it's useful

1166
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,000
for you all right difference between

1167
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,200
malware and fishing that's not a there's

1168
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,160
not a huge difference here

1169
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:25,439
okay there's from the perspective of

1170
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,640
just like the slide says

1171
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:30,160
from this perspective of this behavior

1172
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,359
violates our terms of service so on and

1173
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,560
so forth it's not really much of a

1174
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:33,440
difference as far as your hosting

1175
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,839
provider

1176
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,800
is concerned or your platform or your

1177
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:38,400
registrar

1178
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,160
if you're violating terms of service

1179
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,760
whether it's a c2 server whether it's a

1180
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,480
beef hook the browser exploitation

1181
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,400
framework

1182
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,320
or whether it's a spear phishing website

1183
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,640
it's the same concept there

1184
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,640
phishing though definitely some

1185
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,040
copyright issues to take into account

1186
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,960
meaning

1187
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,880
if i'm hosting a c2 server i'm not

1188
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,240
copying the theme from dropbox.com it's

1189
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,640
irrelevant i'm not doing that

1190
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,680
so there's some variance nuance there

1191
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:02,960
without a doubt

1192
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:05,598
and of course phishing is

1193
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,480
definitely much better understood i say

1194
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:08,880
c2

1195
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,400
command and control i'm sorry if i if

1196
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,240
anyone here didn't

1197
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,760
immediately know what that was you know

1198
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,479
but not everyone does

1199
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:19,280
c2 means command and control and that's

1200
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:21,680
not quite as obvious and prevalent

1201
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,960
for people not in the know fishing

1202
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,359
everyone knows what fishing is

1203
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,640
it most everyone in this industry you

1204
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:28,000
know but c2 well

1205
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,319
maybe not everyone understands that so

1206
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,440
the point here is when

1207
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,640
it's more obvious to the layperson

1208
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,200
it's more likely to potentially get

1209
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:39,920
taken down so the other thing here

1210
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:41,200
providers might work with you if they

1211
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,839
think your website was compromised

1212
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,720
that's that's a reality meaning oh it

1213
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,320
wasn't me

1214
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,759
doing this on purpose my website was

1215
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,880
compromised that's why there's phishing

1216
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,040
yeah right

1217
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,480
i'm not advocating saying that at all i

1218
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:55,440
always tell the truth

1219
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:57,200
my providers i say hey my here's my name

1220
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,560
here's my company spidersec

1221
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,240
and you can just go to the website right

1222
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,880
now and read what we do you know this

1223
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,319
isn't

1224
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,319
new we've been in business for five

1225
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:07,520
years and this is

1226
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:08,800
who are who we're dealing with so anyway

1227
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:11,520
other things you can do the difference

1228
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:14,400
here maybe a non-standard report

1229
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,200
could help you out so other things to

1230
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,200
think about

1231
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,640
before i go back to pm science's

1232
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,078
question and any other questions that

1233
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:23,279
pop up here in discord

1234
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:25,280
are really going to be firewall

1235
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,880
firewall stuff off there's no need to

1236
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,319
tell the world about your phishing

1237
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,920
website or your commanding control

1238
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:31,440
server before the world needs to know

1239
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,400
about it quite frankly you could host

1240
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,240
this

1241
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,440
on your local linux box or your windows

1242
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,680
machine as your

1243
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,880
as your preference may be and then just

1244
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:42,480
go live last minute

1245
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:44,400
with the actual content the reputation

1246
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:47,680
helps lot bullet point that means

1247
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:50,880
get the domain name get the certificate

1248
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:52,240
host something benign on there like a

1249
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:56,240
legitimate

1250
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:59,279
blog or a legitimate photography

1251
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,919
gallery or whatever and it just sits

1252
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,839
there

1253
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,920
it gets some traffic and it gets

1254
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:05,599
reputation reputation which isn't

1255
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,480
negative and then when you're ready to

1256
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:10,480
pull the trigger that's when

1257
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,920
you upload the more malicious component

1258
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,000
to it and the other thing here

1259
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,599
yeah flip a record mx last minute

1260
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,200
absolutely per dog brush

1261
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:18,960
just switch over dns point somewhere

1262
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,879
else and you're good to go that's

1263
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,079
even smarter other smart things you can

1264
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,200
do

1265
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:27,839
redirect if your

1266
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:29,520
target organization that you work for or

1267
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:31,200
you're working with if you know

1268
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,560
if it's like a single location which is

1269
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,439
probably not nowadays everyone's working

1270
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,520
from home

1271
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,520
but if people were all in the office

1272
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:39,040
coming from one netted ip address

1273
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,720
you know that ip address is because you

1274
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,440
work there you're doing this in-house as

1275
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,439
an internal

1276
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,640
security awareness training pen tester

1277
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,079
whatever your title may be

1278
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,000
then you already know if the ip address

1279
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:51,680
is and you can just white

1280
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,200
you can just you can just redirect

1281
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,799
when you see that ip address on your

1282
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,399
apache web server or some

1283
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,000
other upstream device you can say if i

1284
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:01,200
see this ip address then show

1285
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,359
this page that in in php or your.net or

1286
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:06,078
java as occasionally as well

1287
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:08,240
same thing for c2 traffic if you if you

1288
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:10,319
know what to look for

1289
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,359
then you can just show the visitor what

1290
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:13,759
you want them to see

1291
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:14,799
so regular visitor who goes and stumbles

1292
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,880
across

1293
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,160
your phishing domain just use the

1294
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,240
regular blog

1295
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,920
whereas someone who you're targeting

1296
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,680
actually sees

1297
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,200
the phishing website i always have some

1298
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:26,879
backup plans in place

1299
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,000
and then bulletproof kind of last

1300
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,560
thought there with bulletproof hosting

1301
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,440
providers

1302
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:33,520
i took a serious look at them after this

1303
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:36,480
happened like the second or third time

1304
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:37,680
yes very sneaky indeed the bulletproof

1305
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,599
hosting providers though

1306
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,879
they didn't seem to didn't seem to be

1307
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:43,839
viable they were

1308
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,640
quite expensive like hundreds of dollars

1309
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:47,440
a month

1310
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,240
for hosting and it's difficult to

1311
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:52,000
justify that

1312
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:53,359
that price point number one number two

1313
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,280
looking at the second bullet point on

1314
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:55,759
the slide deck again reputation helps

1315
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,000
that

1316
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:02,000
what do you think the reputation is of a

1317
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:05,280
bulletproof hosting provider's ip range

1318
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:08,000
yeah okay you're

1319
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,760
you're lucky and your your kind of

1320
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,319
mileage may vary with that but

1321
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,280
generally speaking nowadays maybe the

1322
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:16,079
ipv6

1323
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,680
if you can get one of those but still

1324
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:19,359
you're paying a lot of money for it

1325
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:21,598
and what i mean by bulletproof hosting

1326
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:24,960
just so we're on the same page is

1327
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:27,200
when a bulletproof hosting provider

1328
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,480
receives an abuse notification or take

1329
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,118
down requests

1330
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,920
they're going to say no i like this

1331
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:34,640
phishing website

1332
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:36,480
it's staying up that's kind of the

1333
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:38,319
concept behind bulletproof hosting

1334
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,599
meaning your hosting provider is going

1335
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:41,599
to have your back

1336
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:43,040
and not take your website offline unless

1337
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:44,240
you violate the terms of service which

1338
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,920
is usually

1339
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:47,680
very very limited in terms of what they

1340
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,280
don't allow so that's

1341
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,799
certainly an option depending what

1342
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,400
you're trying to host and what your

1343
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,319
needs are you can definitely look into

1344
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,000
something like that okay

1345
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:57,520
i'm gonna back up here i'm down to about

1346
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,319
nine minutes or so

1347
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:01,520
and i've highlighted pms sorry pm

1348
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:04,160
scientist question

1349
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:05,920
question what pros and cons exist for

1350
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:09,279
using a sites you manage

1351
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:11,520
as reverse proxy to man in the middle or

1352
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:14,640
machine in the middle a simulated site

1353
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:17,119
versus copying the right bits of the

1354
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:18,640
simulated site

1355
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:20,319
i was hoping i'd have a better answer

1356
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:22,078
for this by now i don't know if i fully

1357
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:25,440
understand that question

1358
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:25,440
what's what's good about

1359
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:30,078
using a site i managed as a reverse

1360
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,079
proxy

1361
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:35,200
to ban the middle assimilate

1362
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:37,440
yeah i still don't really understand

1363
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:39,839
that i don't think and i apologize

1364
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,839
for that

1365
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,240
other thing doug brush mentioned if you

1366
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,720
can only pay for your hosting provider

1367
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,200
with

1368
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:49,439
uh bitcoin yeah that was the other thing

1369
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,439
um

1370
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:53,680
i wasn't about it's like i was trying to

1371
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:56,800
pay with um

1372
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,680
what was it uh that one that ebay came

1373
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,599
up with

1374
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,960
uh paypal it's like i'll pay with paypal

1375
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:02,160
they're like no we don't wanna accept

1376
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,920
paypal

1377
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,359
it's uh bitcoin only i was like well i

1378
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,640
guess that makes sense

1379
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:08,160
you know how about a credit card no we

1380
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,598
don't take credit cards it's bitcoin

1381
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:11,040
only and it totally if you're a

1382
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:11,760
bulletproof hosting provider i get it

1383
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,680
and

1384
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,880
i was kind of being foolish there but

1385
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,399
you know that's what it is

1386
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,560
um he's talking about captioning

1387
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:21,680
credentials in fight um

1388
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:22,480
okay is there any benefit to doing it

1389
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:25,839
that way

1390
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:28,640
um in

1391
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:29,279
in the premise of this conversation that

1392
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,640
doesn't

1393
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:34,880
come up so much like

1394
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,879
uh

1395
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,800
if i'm understanding it correctly so pm

1396
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:42,880
scientist

1397
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,640
uh thinking that reverse proxies need to

1398
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,839
copy images of css and communicate refer

1399
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,960
headers as you know i got what you're

1400
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:49,520
saying i think i already said

1401
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,720
yeah without a doubt um that could prove

1402
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:53,759
to be useful for you

1403
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:54,799
the the thing i mean you could do an

1404
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,800
iframe too

1405
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,319
quite frankly something like that could

1406
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,920
work as well

1407
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:01,520
but you're still still going to see some

1408
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:04,560
calls to that

1409
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:06,480
uh to legitimate company

1410
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:08,319
one way or another some amount of

1411
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,560
benefit i'm sure there's some downsides

1412
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:12,160
uh yeah there potentially could be just

1413
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:14,799
depends what you're trying to accomplish

1414
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:16,640
um and what your kind of risk tolerance

1415
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:19,359
is there with that

1416
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:20,879
all right what else uh questions that's

1417
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:23,119
it i don't tweet very much

and set up so they don't make the

1426
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:40,959

1441

you for speaking today

1442
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:10,240
one thing that i think that we can all

1443
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,480
agree on is that if he

1444
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,759
sends a link in an email we are not

1445
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:17,440
clicking it yeah

1446
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:19,599
pretty much that's fair

1447
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,839
certainly fair now i have a feeling that

1448
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:23,200
the last four times i clicked on dropbox

1449
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:25,759
it probably wasn't even

1450
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:28,078
dropbox and he's got all the files i

1451
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,520
uploaded but

1452
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,640
i don't want you guys to stuff unless

1453
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:32,960
you're paying me that's someone's paying

1454
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:34,960
me for it and it's legitimate uh

1455
