00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,440
about me here in a second um but for

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,719
those of you that do know me i did this

16
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,399
talk

17
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,760
back at defcon in the red team village

18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,120
back in

19
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,680
august um this is actually a amended

20
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,879
version

21
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,480
of the talk um just from taking uh

22
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,559
questions and answers from the previous

23
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,239
one and applying it to this one

24
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,399
i've also taken out some of the the

25
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,879
material that you know was kind of

26
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,199
redundant in the old presentation so

27
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,479
it's a lot more concise in this one

28
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:10,240
um so with that being said

29
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,000
let's go ahead and just you know get to

30
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,320
it huh

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,360
so here's going to be the agenda for

32
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,880
today

33
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,799
so we're going to go through all these

34
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,560
bullet points and i don't want to

35
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,320
mention everyone because we

36
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,080
are uh we do have a limited amount of

37
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,080
time so i can sit here and talk about

38
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,400
these bullet points all day however

39
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,679
um just to brief give a brief mention

40
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,799
introduction just going to give a brief

41
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,640
introduction to myself

42
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,560
let you see some of the things that i've

43
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,040
done over the course of my career and

44
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,720
how

45
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,240
it's been at different ends of the

46
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,280
spectrum

47
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,039
we're going to talk about how you

48
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,520
develop a student mindset not an

49
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,799
academic mindset a student mindset

50
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,798
talk about some ways of how we can

51
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,640
become a penetration tester look at

52
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,920
degrees and certifications which is a

53
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,880
big big thing in this

54
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,079
uh in this area cost analysis how much

55
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,679
we got to spend

56
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,839
then we're going to look at some actual

57
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,840
road map diagrams that i put together

58
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,119
and we're going to look at how you can

59
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,360
go from being a help desk

60
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,880
specialist to a penetration tester or

61
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,399
even just a student

62
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,000
because those are the two more common

63
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,598
tracks that i see they're going to talk

64
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,560
about staying curious and there's a

65
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:14,799
common question

66
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:18,319
um that i wanted to answer at the end so

67
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,520
let's go ahead and get going so who am i

68
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:23,280
my name is john helmes um i'm currently

69
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,239
a penetration tester

70
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,360
and a adjunct professor however i wasn't

71
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,560
always that i actually used to be a

72
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,800
naval engineer

73
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,400
um and a help desk specialist myself and

74
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,680
i've gone to the ranks

75
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,599
over the past uh about six years um

76
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,840
after my military career my military

77
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:42,959
career ended in 2014

78
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,959
so now i've been going yeah

79
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,800
from being a help desk guy to what i'm

80
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,480
doing now i'm also monitoring the

81
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,680
discord channel just so you know so if i

82
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,720
peek over and i start answering

83
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,280
questions

84
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,879
um just so you know that's uh that's it

85
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,480
so somebody said is that am i holding a

86
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,959
chicken yes that is uh one of my

87
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,399
chickens

88
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:03,200
i have a small farm outside of seattle

89
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,000
um where we have alpacas which you'll

90
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,679
actually see in

91
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,480
a slide or two uh we have goats a pig

92
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,879
ducks chickens the whole nine yards so

93
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,840
let's

94
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,760
uh let's keep going with that huh so but

95
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,400
to give brevity to what's on the slide

96
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,599
right now

97
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,440
as you can see i've had a lot of

98
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,359
different experiences that have led me

99
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,000
into pen testing so what i want to

100
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,879
project

101
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,080
on to you is to let you know that you

102
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,440
know there's a

103
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,200
ton of different avenues that you can

104
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,120
use to get into pen testing and it's not

105
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,560
a one size fits all you can do a lot of

106
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,120
everything and we're going to start to

107
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,640
notice that

108
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,319
there's going to be a common theme where

109
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,640
you have to kind of just be

110
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,480
curious about everything it's not just

111
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,599
about hacking or a certain technology

112
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,840
it's just kind of

113
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,280
being curious about any kind of

114
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,840
technology that you want to get your

115
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,840
hands dirty with

116
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,640
so these are some of the current things

117
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,360
i'm doing

118
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,720
i am a penetration tester red teamer at

119
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,000
nordstrom headquarters up here in

120
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,720
seattle washington

121
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,319
i'm also a agile professor at city

122
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,840
university of seattle and national

123
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,000
university i teach

124
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,439
online courses for both of the schools

125
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,920
that range from

126
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,879
basic cyber security network and

127
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,159
wireless

128
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,640
security cyber warfare at national i

129
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,199
actually

130
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,560
teach red teaming and penetration

131
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,840
testing so if you're interested in

132
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,479
getting a master's degree

133
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:25,440
in pen testing uh look them up and

134
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:29,120
you'll probably have me as a professor

135
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,800
so and then i'm also a phd candidate at

136
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,360
the dakota state university i'm

137
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,720
currently

138
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:37,040
in the phd of cyber ops program

139
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,840
um it's a pretty fun program so far i

140
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,400
just started it

141
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,880
but i'm really really enjoying it so far

142
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,880
and

143
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,800
as you can see here at the bottom right

144
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,600
that is another asset of my life

145
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,759
where i actually have a small mini farm

146
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,360
um we have alpacas we have goats we have

147
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,720
pigs we have chicken stocks the whole

148
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,960
nine yards right

149
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,000
um so that's what i like to do in my

150
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,599
free time because

151
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,479
it's something that actually gets me

152
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,639
outside and away from the computer

153
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,599
so it's uh it's one of those nice things

154
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,880
that physically

155
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,400
puts me away from everything so

156
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,840
uh and just so you know if i look over

157
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,039
the side again just monitoring the

158
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,159
discord chat

159
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:16,960
no moose no uh

160
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,440
mail mooses are pretty aggressive from

161
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,440
what i've heard

162
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,080
so let's really talk about what we're

163
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,120
here to talk about because we're not

164
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,400
here to talk about me

165
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,080
we're here to talk about how we can

166
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,440
learn to become a pen tester so

167
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,758
penetration testing

168
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,680
also known as pen testing or a pen test

169
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,639
ethical hacking keyword is ethical there

170
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,800
right

171
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,160
is an authorized other keyword is

172
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,000
authorized simulated attack on a

173
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,320
computer system to perform

174
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,840
um and evaluate the security of that

175
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,280
system so we're looking at the security

176
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,440
posture of a system through actually

177
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,719
exploiting vulnerabilities

178
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,680
and assessing the impact and severity on

179
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,639
those vulnerabilities

180
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,520
to the organization however while you

181
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,720
think you might think

182
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,680
it's just technical vulnerabilities we

183
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,120
look at more than just technical

184
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,199
vulnerabilities we look at people

185
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,199
we look at processes we even challenge

186
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,560
culture in an organization

187
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,199
right because culture is something that

188
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,440
is hard to make to pivot

189
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,280
so it's really um crucial that you

190
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,680
understand that even changing culture is

191
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,198
part

192
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,960
of being a penetration tester where you

193
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,479
actually have to look and see

194
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,000
if there's something that's toxic within

195
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,359
an organization that you actually have

196
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,960
to change otherwise

197
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,759
the the company may you know start

198
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,758
losing revenue

199
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,159
all right so it's more than just hacking

200
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,960
right it's a lot of research a lot of

201
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,759
writing

202
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,960
a lot of writing a lot of reading um i

203
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,840
always like to say that you know it's

204
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,719
about 70

205
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,880
writing reading reporting and about 30

206
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,440
technical

207
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,199
so you know a lot of writing and reading

208
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,800
and research goes and takes place before

209
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,840
the pen test during the pen test and

210
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,000
after the pen test

211
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,758
and there is a lot of technical portions

212
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,919
where your hands on keyboard however

213
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,680
think about it as if you your hands on

214
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,080
keyboard and you actually find

215
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,000
a vulnerability on a system you then

216
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,919
have to turn around

217
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,360
and actually do research on that

218
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,520
vulnerability because you want to be

219
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,319
concise and precise with your attack

220
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,318
method so that you can illustrate that

221
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,840
later to the client or your organization

222
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,960
whoever you're working for

223
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,560
so it's it's crucial that you you're

224
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,758
able to perform

225
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,639
not just good technical skills but also

226
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:27,840
uh proper cyber research and

227
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,840
illustrating what you find

228
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,840
and then i always like to put this the

229
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,960
reality check is it's about people and

230
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,318
processes

231
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:39,120
right we're looking at the technology

232
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,400
that is intertwined with business people

233
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,880
or well i'm sorry the people

234
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,638
of the business and the processes of

235
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,919
that business right so we're looking at

236
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,599
all the technology stacks and the

237
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,080
culture and the people the processes

238
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,919
that all

239
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,599
all the good stuff right it says

240
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,120
technical skills play a major role they

241
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,840
do technical skills are one of the

242
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,360
is the is a very crucial role because it

243
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,919
plays a huge part

244
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,960
in pen testing it's just not the most

245
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,240
utilized one

246
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,479
because um you know it's about people

247
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,680
right and making an organization better

248
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,280
than it was before

249
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,039
so you have to have soft skills that

250
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,159
play a vital role

251
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:16,240
in doing so so you have to concurrently

252
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,080
be able to walk the walk and not talk

253
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,759
the talk so that means you have to be

254
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,758
able to do the technical stuff while

255
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,080
you're also able to illustrate it

256
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,599
uh properly and what i mean by properly

257
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,520
is more professionally where you're able

258
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,560
to actually take low level

259
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,520
um technology findings talk jargon

260
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,120
whatever you want to call it

261
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,120
and display it at a level that everyone

262
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,360
can understand it because otherwise

263
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,880
you're gonna it can make people stray

264
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,039
away from understanding it

265
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,000
and they might just completely forget

266
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,560
about whatever you're

267
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
talking about so the reality of pin

268
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,439
testing is banging your head against the

269
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,600
wall and looking for systems that are

270
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,279
typically locked down

271
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,560
i always like to say that pin testers

272
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:55,040
are just highly technical quality

273
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,160
assurance engineers and i'm sure there's

274
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,199
some people on the other side of the

275
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,959
screen that are

276
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,640
that don't agree with that but that's

277
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:03,680
just my opinion

278
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,040
so and penetration testing is 70 report

279
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,760
writing and research and probably only

280
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,480
about 30

281
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,480
hands-on that's just you know from my

282
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,880
own research and and being in the field

283
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,760
is there's it's just so much research

284
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,160
and reporting

285
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,279
and writing and very little and a lot of

286
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,800
hands-on but the

287
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,320
the hands-on portion makes up the

288
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,439
smaller

289
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,120
portion of pen testing

290
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,800
and then a big reason why we have pen

291
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,360
testing besides wanting to know what

292
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,000
your security posture is

293
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,200
and having to you know actually have a

294
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,160
simulated

295
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,600
attack executed on your organization so

296
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,040
that it can illustrate your security

297
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,839
posture before the bad guys actually get

298
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,959
in

299
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,399
is a is it is a big thing

300
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,119
however the other big reason is

301
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,200
compliance right it's being regulated

302
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,399
companies are now regulated to have

303
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,640
their organizations

304
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,080
ethically hacked i'll say that again

305
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:58,240
organizations are

306
00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:01,120
being regulated to have their companies

307
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,240
ethically hacked at least once to twice

308
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,240
a year

309
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,000
so what does that mean that means

310
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,959
there's job opportunities because it has

311
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,079
to be done

312
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,000
right and we're going to talk a little

313
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,120
bit about that later about their

314
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,200
certifications

315
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,160
um that can get you so that you can be

316
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,160
compliance

317
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,680
um pen test ready right because in order

318
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,279
to be a pen tester to do compliance

319
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,000
based pen testing you have to have those

320
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,079
certs

321
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,800
there's no bloods or butts about it you

322
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,800
gotta do it

323
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,240
so becoming a pen tester

324
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,360
it looks like we're gonna start to make

325
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,360
our journey down the rabbit hole

326
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,600
as we do this let's make sure we stay

327
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:45,279
open-minded and stay curious

328
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,440
so down the rabbit hole we go

329
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,320
all right so the student mindset it's

330
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,360
not an academic

331
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,600
mindset will an academic mindset help

332
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,279
you

333
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,519
of course but a lot of other things will

334
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,959
help you too

335
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,760
so developing a student mindset is going

336
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,000
to help you engage yourself be humble

337
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,640
with

338
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,560
yourself to continuously learn and know

339
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,000
what you don't know

340
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,439
right so that goes with continuous

341
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,279
learning staying out of your comfort

342
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,360
zone there's a book that i really

343
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,439
um really really enjoyed a couple years

344
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,640
ago called peak performance

345
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,320
don't know who wrote it i'll have to

346
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,839
look it up and i can put in the discord

347
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,160
chat here in a bit

348
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,839
after the talk um there's a talk or i'm

349
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,040
sorry a book called peak performance

350
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,560
where it actually talks about

351
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,160
maintaining just slightly out of your

352
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,560
comfort zone and then taking breaks so

353
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,760
that

354
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,279
you're able to expand um your comfort

355
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,880
zone right because if you're here

356
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,399
and then you expand a little bit out and

357
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,680
then you rest you might go only like

358
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,040
halfway back and then you actually have

359
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,319
a new comfort zone you're able to take

360
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,719
on more

361
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,720
um it also teaches you that you know you

362
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:46,560
you can continuously learn it gets you

363
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:49,200
um conditioned for that being humble

364
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,079
being humble is a big um issue in this

365
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,240
career field

366
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,680
uh so i've noticed um and there's a the

367
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,639
next slide kind of mentions a little bit

368
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,560
about that

369
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,000
um but we have to be humble and know

370
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,359
that we don't know everything about we i

371
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,959
mean pen testers and security

372
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,800
researchers and just offensive security

373
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,959
professionals in general

374
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,959
we don't know everything we know a

375
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:09,680
little bit about the things that we're

376
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,079
we're targeting right and then we might

377
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,160
have

378
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:15,839
a subject that we have uh mastered

379
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,199
but we don't know everything so be

380
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,440
humble stay grounded

381
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,720
and ensure that you portray that to

382
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,720
anyone that you interact with

383
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,079
continuous goals this is where you set

384
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,320
continuous

385
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,760
realistic goals for yourself don't set

386
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,360
something crazy

387
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,200
within a six-month span because if you

388
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,279
burn out in the time before that you're

389
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,519
probably not going to want to do it

390
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,480
and i speak that from experience many

391
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,800
many times

392
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,680
and just from observing it from other

393
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,760
people

394
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,839
take your time this is a career field

395
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,639
that is not going anywhere

396
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,279
and you can you know the sky is the

397
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,120
limit but it's

398
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,760
in the skies and go anywhere so just set

399
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,760
continuous goals throughout your career

400
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,439
seek mentors find people that know more

401
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,959
than you that are willing to help

402
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,560
a keyword is willing to help you don't

403
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,599
want to find some jerk who's not going

404
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,880
to help you because

405
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,160
they want to hold the keys to the

406
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,040
kingdom of their information and

407
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,399
knowledge

408
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,399
find people that are going to help you

409
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,200
and are helping others because when they

410
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,720
help others

411
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,079
you may will be able to help out the

412
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,880
other people that they mention at some

413
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:16,079
point you may

414
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,600
surpass the master so to speak or you

415
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,359
may get to a level where you're able to

416
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,560
help other people

417
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,040
another big thing is don't seek

418
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,800
validation in this field seek education

419
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,880
seek to educate yourself and others

420
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,560
don't don't pen test just to say i

421
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,880
validate myself as a hacker

422
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,040
no you're gonna turn into that

423
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:36,160
non-humble jerk

424
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,000
um always seek to be educated and

425
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:42,000
educate yourself

426
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,399
um that's a that's a big thing and then

427
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,560
none of this can be possible without

428
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,680
leaving uh fear in the rear view mirror

429
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,680
if you are scared to do any of this

430
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,120
and anything else within this uh this

431
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,638
talk today

432
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,320
you're not going to be it's going to

433
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,240
help it's going to make you fall short

434
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,760
and it's going to have a a snowball

435
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,519
effect where you won't be able to

436
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,360
to probably achieve the things that you

437
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,399
desire so you just have to leave fear in

438
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,839
the rearview mirror

439
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:10,399
and not care about the risk right

440
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,079
i'm not saying like go into hundreds of

441
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:15,440
thousands of dollars of student debt

442
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:16,959
to buy certs and education but do

443
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,040
set realistic goals for yourself that

444
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,599
you can achieve and don't worry about

445
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,920
um you know the trivial risk that comes

446
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,920
with that

447
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,279
so be humble not a megalomaniac i uh

448
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,199
tied in a

449
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,399
uh twitter post that i put out not too

450
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,760
long ago it says i don't know who needs

451
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,360
to hear this but offensive security

452
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,279
doesn't make you better than anyone last

453
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,519
i checked megalomania is not a must-have

454
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,880
on job applications

455
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,040
for those of us that work in the field

456
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,439
we know this very well where we see a

457
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,040
lot

458
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,639
of individuals who think because they're

459
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,079
a hacker and they know how to break a

460
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,639
certain type of technology that all of a

461
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,880
sudden

462
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,800
they have this superior than thou god

463
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,519
like complex

464
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,760
don't do it um you know your technical

465
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,680
skills are not too much powerful

466
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,600
right your job is to help people and

467
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,160
make organizations better

468
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,199
because it's one common goal to make

469
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,880
organizations better

470
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:16,479
and um eliminate any kind of threat

471
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:16,480
right so be humble not a megalomaniac

472
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,920
so be curious don't ditch the bucket

473
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,240
list but

474
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,360
do ditch the bucket list don't ditch the

475
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,959
bucket list when i think about it is

476
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,800
like something you want to do before

477
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,800
before you die right don't think about

478
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,479
the end just think about how you're

479
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,279
going to continuously grow

480
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,720
right and be curious so always look at

481
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,880
things from a different perspective

482
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,240
be hungry to learn new things be willing

483
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,000
to dive into anything

484
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,759
and tinker with anything you have to be

485
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,079
kind of like but yes person

486
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,600
you have to be able to just dive into

487
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,279
anything and take it on

488
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,959
right and that also feeds into staying

489
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,519
out of your comfort zone you have to do

490
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,279
that

491
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,120
i don't know any penetration tester that

492
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,519
hasn't had to maintain some type of

493
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,279
level

494
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,800
outside of their their comfort zone for

495
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,480
quite a while because you're constantly

496
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,839
learning new things so you have to

497
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,839
if you want to get into this field why

498
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,000
not start prepping yourself up

499
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,880
right try to understand different

500
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,120
technology

501
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,480
because being a pen test is about being

502
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,680
a jack of all trades and a master of

503
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,000
none you might master

504
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,359
something however if you master it today

505
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,560
it might change tomorrow

506
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,279
so do you really master it debatable

507
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,880
right

508
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:25,759
it's it's up for argument uh looking

509
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,199
at the discord chat really quick oh

510
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,519
there's a lot you guys are chatting it

511
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,519
up man

512
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,519
so growing your network this is probably

513
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,880
one of the most crucial things in my

514
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:38,160
opinion

515
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,120
and why because there's a saying that

516
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,959
you know

517
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,360
getting into infosec is sometimes not

518
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,040
about what you know but who you know

519
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,720
right so growing your network how can we

520
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,040
grow our network well for us

521
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,079
that are going to school or work for

522
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,560
school rather

523
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,599
whatever way it is or if you do both use

524
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,920
the school network

525
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,519
typically alumni are working in the

526
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,880
field or may not be working in the field

527
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,680
but if they are working in the field use

528
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,720
the alumni

529
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,799
networks to get into the field

530
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,319
linkedin linkedin is my favorite place

531
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:09,679
on the internet

532
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:12,159
um it's a great place to to collaborate

533
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,199
to reach out and illustrate your skills

534
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,880
i see a lot of

535
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,640
individuals on there right now they're

536
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,319
doing like try hack me challenges and

537
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,600
getting certs and they're publicizing it

538
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,520
all over the place

539
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,958
and that helps you get visibility

540
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,760
because somebody will like it and then

541
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,360
that gets

542
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,640
displayed on somebody else's feed and

543
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,479
somebody might share and that gets

544
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,480
displayed on somebody else's feed

545
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,919
so just keep grinding and posting things

546
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,400
on linkedin and it's going to help you

547
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,520
find a

548
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,960
find a spot and you can network with

549
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,080
people fairly easily right you just send

550
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,840
them a friends request

551
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,280
you know just go find the ceos of all

552
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,918
the big tech companies

553
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,440
just kidding twitter is another good

554
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,200
place twitter i like to think about as

555
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,039
like the common ground between linkedin

556
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,240
and facebook it's where you link with

557
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:52,320
other professionals but you don't have

558
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:55,600
to be so professional

559
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,960
um so that's a good place to do

560
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,799
look because there's a lot there's an

561
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,080
infosec twitter that is wonderful

562
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,918
there's lots of resources always being

563
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,080
posted out lots of information a great

564
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:07,440
place to learn and just to network

565
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:10,080
in a less professional um

566
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,400
more lackadaisic environment so to speak

567
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,399
online

568
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,120
facebook facebook is an interesting

569
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,480
place because you never know that person

570
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,719
that you knew five years ago might

571
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:24,160
actually work in the field

572
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:26,960
and so hit them up mentoring

573
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,760
you need to find um people that can

574
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,520
mentor you

575
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,600
and also find people below you that you

576
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,679
can mentor right it's

577
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,600
it's kind of a roundabout way but you're

578
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:39,280
able to share knowledge from

579
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,320
who you are a mentee of and mentor other

580
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,440
mentees

581
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,439
um and it creates this kind of like

582
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,799
telephone effect but what happens is you

583
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,840
think it you speak it

584
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,918
and then you hear somebody else

585
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,799
comprehend it and it helps solidify that

586
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,280
knowledge

587
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,639
in you even more and it helps um you

588
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,760
know you never know a mentee of yours

589
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,039
might actually get into the field

590
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,000
because of their network and they can

591
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,679
say oh yeah hey

592
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,919
uh come on over you know we gotta spot

593
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,919
the fill over here

594
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,000
conventions such as today with besides

595
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,240
denver again thank you for having me

596
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,840
is uh another great place to network

597
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,160
right uh for those of you in the discord

598
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,678
chat or on the twitch stream

599
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,760
you guys can sit there and hit each

600
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,679
other up and and banter and talk about

601
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,280
anything you want and you never know

602
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,960
you might make an actual really good

603
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,399
relationship out of that

604
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,840
and that might be the key to your

605
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,000
success to getting into information

606
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,879
security or finding that new uh

607
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,840
role in offensive security internships

608
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,840
are another good thing

609
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,520
i know they're they they didn't really

610
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,000
happen this past uh

611
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,840
summer because of kovid so you know

612
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,600
that's the exception not the rule but

613
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,199
internships are really good to do

614
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,879
um and you don't necessarily need to be

615
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,600
in school to do an internship don't ever

616
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,840
think that

617
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,760
um internships are not exclusively to

618
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,918
just students

619
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,160
and then on the job training you know go

620
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,280
find a company that might be looking for

621
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,440
free help

622
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,960
um or any kind of help that will lead

623
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,840
you into information security

624
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,280
or penetration testing um i did that i

625
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,199
actually was a security guard at one

626
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,840
point and then went and worked in a sock

627
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,480
because i wanted to get into i.t that

628
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,280
bad

629
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,720
so i did a lot of free labor working in

630
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,520
the sock

631
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,799
fun fact so just you know that's again

632
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,879
it's about being

633
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,918
just tinkering and saying yes to a lot

634
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:21,440
of things and staying out of your

635
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:23,600
comfort zone

636
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,039
growing your technical skills john how

637
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,439
do we grow our technical skills

638
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:29,360
well there's lots thankfully in this day

639
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,919
and age there's a lot when i even when i

640
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,439
started

641
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,840
in offensive security like five years

642
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,559
ago there there was nothing you go

643
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,799
download a

644
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:38,080
virtual image of kali linux and then you

645
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,600
try to find other

646
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,439
things to tinker around with now they

647
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,000
have you know things like this like try

648
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,640
hack me

649
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,320
hack the box loan hub these

650
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,280
organizations are creating platforms

651
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,840
where you can learn

652
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,120
in a fun and encouraging environment to

653
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,559
be honest um

654
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,840
i really like hack the box because it's

655
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,760
competitive and i really like tri

656
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,559
hackney for the fact that it's very

657
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,080
um student-centric where it's more about

658
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,440
learning

659
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,280
and then vulner hub is obviously where

660
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,039
you can go grab images install it on

661
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,039
your machine and go hack away

662
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,480
um in a safe sandbox environment within

663
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,919
your own home the other great thing

664
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,760
about loanhub is that they recently made

665
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,840
a partnership

666
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,360
with offensive security so if you're

667
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,959
looking to do the oscp

668
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:20,399
i would look at bonehub images in the

669
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:22,480
future for extra study material

670
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,600
um books obvious one right and i can't

671
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,840
recommend a book

672
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,199
because there are so many i do have a

673
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,000
book coming out in the next couple

674
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,120
months

675
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,720
with pac about aws pen testing so if

676
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,360
you're interested in learning cloud pen

677
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,120
testing

678
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,918
pick it up hacker one and bug crowd one

679
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,639
of these these

680
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,159
are above bounding platforms these are

681
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,080
where you can sign up create an account

682
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,919
and then actually go hack real websites

683
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,720
i love these because they actually have

684
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:50,880
you hack production websites and provide

685
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,159
vulnerability reports on what you find

686
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,679
and then

687
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,200
if you find something it actually goes

688
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,960
into your account you actually can have

689
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,559
a hacker badge that you can display on

690
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,880
linkedin or twitter and

691
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,320
and use that as a way to publicize

692
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,000
yourself

693
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,439
uh programming i can't recommend a

694
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,400
language necessarily but

695
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,880
i am um biased towards like python and

696
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,760
ruby

697
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,000
just because i'm not a programmer um but

698
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,400
i

699
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,440
do know enough python and ruby to do

700
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,679
enough for my job

701
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,960
as a penetration tester um so if you're

702
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,320
looking at that i would

703
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,919
highly recommend diving into one of

704
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,520
those two languages probably python is

705
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:26,320
the more popular one

706
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,760
um so yeah so look at those and we'll

707
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,918
talk a little bit more about that later

708
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,440
um and then cobalt io and synack these

709
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,640
are two platforms that are actually

710
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,640
pen testing um services

711
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,400
right it's kind of like a pen test as a

712
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,559
service where you can go

713
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,039
and do uh you submit an application and

714
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:45,280
then they run you through

715
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,720
a um and a couple interviews that are

716
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,399
technical and non-technical and then

717
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,280
they put you on their teams

718
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,240
and they basically send you pen tests

719
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,158
that you can do

720
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,440
and make money so and you actually are

721
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,640
pen testing real companies so it's a

722
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,480
pretty cool way to do like

723
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,320
crowd source pen testing i really really

724
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,000
like it um

725
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,000
i wish i had the time because if i had

726
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,799
the time as i really don't

727
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,919
right now um i would do it but um if

728
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,480
you're looking to get in the field and

729
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,159
get some

730
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,320
your hands dirty that's a great way to

731
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,440
do something

732
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,280
um for those of you that were in the

733
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,559
discord chat i did mention uh some

734
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,678
elearn security stuff

735
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:21,360
so uh ind and elearn security um

736
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,960
have made a partnership where they're

737
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,719
actually creating a training platform

738
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,080
that allows you to take all the elearn

739
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,720
security

740
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,240
courses on this one central platform at

741
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,360
one central price

742
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,520
the reason why i put this here is

743
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,280
because their training platforms

744
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,039
are amazing their training courses are

745
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,158
amazing they have amazing certifications

746
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,320
that are going to

747
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,400
give you 100 percent hands-on knowledge

748
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,840
in a specific topic

749
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,919
so if you want to learn something in an

750
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:49,279
academic and in a realistic sense

751
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:50,320
these are your guys to go to um and if

752
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:54,720
you have any questions

753
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:57,760
uh feel free to ask lily in the discord

754
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,960
she can tell you all about that so speed

755
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,640
bumps

756
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,640
speed bumps are another big thing uh

757
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,200
lacking experience security programming

758
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,120
technical stuff

759
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,720
it's it's it's a conundrum right how do

760
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,158
you get experience

761
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,840
in the field without being in the field

762
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,960
well that's where you have to use your

763
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,320
network and you have to use all these

764
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,080
other resources that we talked about

765
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,879
those bug bounty platforms creating a

766
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,158
blog

767
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,000
a technical blog that's going to help

768
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,520
you out right getting certifications

769
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,120
those are going to help illustrate

770
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,879
your security experience and your

771
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,399
technical experience so you just really

772
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,760
have to climb the ladder

773
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,600
in that sense and you also need to

774
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,200
utilize your network right and i know i

775
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,439
don't put it there but utilize your

776
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:37,279
network

777
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:39,600
again utilize it the network um

778
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:41,440
lacking certs start with the easy ones

779
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,559
uh you know i know a lot of

780
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,679
individuals that when they come into

781
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,799
this field they just want to go grab

782
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,799
oscp

783
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:48,158
and you know while that's great you can

784
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,520
do it um

785
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,120
why not get an easier assert that's

786
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,080
going to help you get a job right

787
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,799
especially if you're on the outside

788
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,879
looking in

789
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:56,559
you're like okay uh you do a linkedin

790
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,840
search for penetration testing jobs or

791
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,399
security jobs and you're like okay i

792
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,240
need

793
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,240
at least this cert go for that so that

794
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,159
you at least need not the big one

795
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,760
the one that you need at least uh

796
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,120
certifications like ceh which we'll talk

797
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,600
about in a minute

798
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,639
are not extremely difficult but they are

799
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,120
compliance-based

800
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,159
um certifications so if you get ceh you

801
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,760
can actually start going and doing

802
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,840
compliance-based pen testing

803
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,360
um i actually did that and i got a job

804
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,918
as a red teamer

805
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,120
for the dod so and i didn't have ocp at

806
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:26,159
that time

807
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,678
lack of job openings um you know denver

808
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,559
i mean i know this is virtual but denver

809
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,720
is actually a

810
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,840
hotbed for security so if you're in

811
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,360
denver and watching this

812
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,480
you're good if you're in seattle and

813
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,080
you're watching this you're good uh

814
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,039
seattle's a pretty hotbed

815
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,840
um for pen testing and security as well

816
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,480
however

817
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,918
i'm actually from uh a smaller town in

818
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,679
north carolina

819
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,960
and i don't really think there's any pen

820
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,240
testing jobs there

821
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,919
so if i had stayed there i wouldn't have

822
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,120
made it into the field right so i had to

823
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,880
move

824
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,959
um so follow the jobs if you're in an

825
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,880
area where where you know you can't get

826
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,039
a job you gotta go where the where the

827
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,440
jobs are luckily a lot more remote now

828
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,400
but you know if that's not the case you

829
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,760
might have to move

830
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:07,600
and you know just gotta do it

831
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,200
lack of motivation that's gonna be a big

832
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,639
speed bump because you're gonna burn out

833
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,000
because you're going to set expectations

834
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,360
for yourself and you're going to not hit

835
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,840
them sometimes and you're going to burn

836
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,120
out

837
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,439
so make sure when you burn out you take

838
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,399
a break because field's not going

839
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,039
anywhere

840
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,840
right enjoy the little things and you

841
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,760
know i feel

842
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,279
i'm sure you know if some of my family

843
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,039

these are the various things that we can

855
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:55,678
do to get into infosec

856
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:57,919
right we can take these furious jobs

857
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,840
helpdesk sysadmin net admin

858
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,440
various security specialists right you

859
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,799
can see there's a lot there

860
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,159
you can be an independent researcher or

861
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,960
a bug bounty hunter signing up for

862
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:08,240
programs like

863
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,760
uh bud crowd and uh and hacker one

864
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,760
or just be a programmer a lot of

865
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,760
individuals go and get um

866
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,200
you know a four-year computer science

867
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,919
degree or go to a coding boot camp and

868
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,279
go be

869
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,440
software engineers for a little bit and

870
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:22,720
then they come into the field there's

871
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,600
really not a strict way to get into this

872
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,360
field

873
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,120
it's just about you know what can you

874
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:30,158
bring to the table that's different

875
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:32,479
right so these are various uh

876
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,240
career fields that you can go into um

877
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,399
i'm sorry jobs that you can go into

878
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,760
to get yourself into infosec has a of

879
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,959
course security specialist you're going

880
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,480
to be in

881
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,840
in information security so that's more

882
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,640
directed if you want to become a pen

883
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,480
tester

884
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,480
but these are just different avenues

885
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,039
that you can take um i've taken a couple

886
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,640
of my

887
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:50,480
i was a helpdesk guy and then i was a

888
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,080
security specialist engineer

889
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,679
i worked in vulnerability management for

890
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:56,879
a while

891
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,880
and uh and now i'm here

892
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,399
knew someone who got into security by

893
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,240
starting as a pastor

894
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:05,840
gonna have to talk about that afterwards

895
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,080
that's interesting

896
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,199
pin testing careers you can be a pen

897
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,279
tester red team or

898
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,320
offensive security engineer applications

899
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:14,000
security engineer

900
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,399
ethical hacker which actually is still a

901
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,279
job title in some places um

902
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:20,000
exploit developer consultant or purple

903
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,919
teamer

904
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,360
purple teamers is becoming a hot topic

905
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:26,080
because it's the in-between

906
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,360
of a blue team and a red team right so

907
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,080
you actually kind of like do a little

908
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,918
bit of both

909
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,639
and you oversee red team and blue team

910
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:34,159
operations

911
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,440
and then so the rest of these exploit

912
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,480
developers you're actually developing

913
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,919
exploits

914
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,640
for the uh the things that you're

915
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:42,960
hacking uh red teamers are the

916
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,320
the offensive operators offensive

917
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,760
security engineer

918
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:49,120
you get it we have a lot of slides so i

919
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,760
have to cruise through some of this so

920
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,279
that i

921
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:55,440
don't take up too much time so education

922
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,880
these are some degrees that you can get

923
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,200
comp sci cyber security

924
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,360
even an mba i know plenty of people in

925
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,559
this field that have an mba

926
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,840
because you understand the business

927
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:08,480
sense of things and it really helps out

928
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,600
so bachelor's degree typically required

929
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,679
master's degree typically

930
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,120
desired stay in school if you want to

931
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,640
stay competitive

932
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,479
right and i know there might be some

933
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,520
people on the other side looking at me

934
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,880
and being like john you don't need a

935
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,480
degree you don't

936
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,159
but it is nice to have a degree and make

937
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,720
you competitive right there's nothing

938
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,720
wrong with that

939
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,960
so um and coming from someone who has a

940
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,320
bachelor's degree a master's degree and

941
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,760
getting a terminal degree i mean it's

942
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,320
helped that those have helped me out a

943
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:36,320
lot

944
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:38,480
um in both um you know growing my career

945
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,840
and you know for monetary gain

946
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,120
essentially i mean you get paid

947
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,760
typically you get paid more if you have

948
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,199
a degree

949
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,039
um it's not always a case but it's a lot

950
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,919
of times it's the case so don't quote me

951
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,440
on that

952
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,720
but you know and you also learn things

953
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,440
from a different sense if you do the

954
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,919
academic

955
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,679
model as well right there's things in in

956
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,840
degrees that certifications can offer

957
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,840
you

958
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:01,679
so here's the big one

959
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:09,840
we got certification so here's some

960
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,840
certs that we're going to talk about

961
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:16,799
so it's kantia sec plus this is a good

962
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,158
cert to get because it's going to give

963
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:20,840
you a foundational

964
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:22,080
knowledge and certify you um in that

965
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,399
knowledge

966
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:26,240
it's 350 bucks for a voucher we'll say

967
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:27,760
200 for extra material and you're gonna

968
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,360
have to study for about one to three

969
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,640
months one to three months of two hours

970
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:34,080
a day

971
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:37,039
about five days a week and anytime i say

972
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,320
consistent study if i don't say how an

973
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:41,279
extra amount of time just say

974
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,520
think it's about two hours a day for you

975
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:44,799
know

976
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:46,720
five days a week at least um the exam is

977
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:48,639
90 questions

978
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,000
maximum you can get less i think when i

979
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,919
took it i took it a while back but

980
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,520
a long time a long time ago um i think i

981
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,720
got like 55 questions

982
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,399
but you have 90 minutes to do it you

983
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,440
have to get a 750 to pass which i

984
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:00,879
believe is like 83

985
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,720
passing without industry experience

986
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,000
because i want to make sure that

987
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,919
for those of you trying to get into the

988
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,440
field understand the difficulty

989
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:09,279
it's not too challenging if you if you

990
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,720
study properly um

991
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:12,480
again using the methods that i just

992
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,519
mentioned you should be able to pass it

993
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,559
on your first time

994
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:17,440
so the average cost per month 160 bucks

995
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,000
because we want to make sure that we're

996
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,480
not going

997
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,440
into crazy debt right and if you look at

998
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,880
it on a month scale

999
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,880
it's about 160 bucks a month

1000
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:31,760
the controversy cert of the decade

1001
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:33,200
controversial cert of the decade the

1002
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,840
ethical hackers

1003
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,320
um it is a twelve hundred dollar voucher

1004
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,600
with a

1005
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,879
about two hundred dollars an extra

1006
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,199
material so you're going to spend about

1007
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,640
1400 bucks total

1008
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,080
it's a good cert to get because like i

1009
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,679
said you can get it and then you're

1010
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,399
you're ready to do compliance-based pen

1011
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:47,600
testing

1012
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:50,799
um it's about one to three months of

1013
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:52,080
consistent studying 125 questions four

1014
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:55,200
hours and you have to get between

1015
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:57,840
60 to 85 to pass so

1016
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,279
how difficult is this to get without any

1017
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:02,000
industry experience

1018
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:03,120
it can be challenging but ec council has

1019
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,840
a two thousand dollar

1020
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,199
course that you can use uh to prep you

1021
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,158
up that might make it less challenging

1022
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,159
when it's two grand

1023
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,679
so the average cost per month without

1024
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,399
that two thousand dollar class is about

1025
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:16,320
450 bucks a month so three months at

1026
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:18,879
about 160

1027
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:21,120
and then plus this and you know you get

1028
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:24,799
it and we'll we'll have a breakdown

1029
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:27,120
here in a second of everything um

1030
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:29,279
the elearn junior penetration tester

1031
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,559
this is without a doubt the best valued

1032
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:32,399
penetration testing cert you're going to

1033
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:33,279
get talk to lily about it because it's

1034
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:35,840
amazing

1035
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:37,600
uh the cost is 200 bucks for a voucher

1036
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:40,240
however you can spend 500 bucks get

1037
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,719
four exam vouchers labs materials the

1038
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,519
whole

1039
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,519
bang that all you need to do it one to

1040
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:48,320
three months of consistent studying

1041
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:50,720
the exam awesome enough is a three-day

1042
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,559
real-life penetration test

1043
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,840
it's awesome right because it's one it's

1044
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,960
it's hands-on

1045
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,559
so you're actually going to learn the

1046
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,919
techniques tactics and procedures that

1047
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:01,519
you have to do

1048
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:04,240
in order to pin test so

1049
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,960
that's uh sorry i'm getting pain and

1050
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,279
discord

1051
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,080
so that's what you you know you get you

1052
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,840
get from it

1053
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,600
um passing without industry experience

1054
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,199
less challenging without with proper

1055
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,799
study but why do i say that because

1056
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,279
you know you think well it's a hands-on

1057
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:18,480
assert it's because e-learn security

1058
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:20,080
really preps you

1059
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,159
to take the exam they give you

1060
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,240
everything that you need

1061
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:26,000
and they and that's it you don't have to

1062
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,279
go digging for extra information if you

1063
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,159
don't want to they give you everything

1064
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,919
to your path

1065
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:32,080
to success to pass the uh the

1066
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:33,600
certification so i highly recommend this

1067
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:38,080
cert no matter where you are in your

1068
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:40,879
career because it's just an amazing cert

1069
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,639
the comptia pin test plus this is a very

1070
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,279
difficult cert in my opinion

1071
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,480
um the voucher is 350 bucks you're gonna

1072
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,720
spend about 300

1073
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,320
extra dollars on materials three to four

1074
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,600
months of consistent studying

1075
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,240
because this is actually going to

1076
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,600
challenge you it's going to give you um

1077
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,600
test questions that are based on

1078
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,760
scenarios so you really have to know

1079
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:02,320
things from a different angle

1080
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:04,399
the exam is 165 minutes with a maximum

1081
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:06,559
of 85 questions you can have less

1082
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:08,319
and you have to get a 750 to pass that's

1083
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:10,159
about an 83

1084
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,079
very challenging without industry

1085
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,200
experience i had industry experience

1086
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,000
when i took this and i found it

1087
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:16,638
challenging

1088
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,879
um you know as humble as that is to say

1089
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:20,560
it was an actually challenging exam

1090
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:22,239
i honestly didn't think i passed when i

1091
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:26,320
took it um

1092
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:27,918
but i did barely humbly enough

1093
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,760
but somebody asked what made it

1094
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:30,560
challenging there's a lot of scenario

1095
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,240
questions in it

1096
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,759
a lot of scenario-based questions that

1097
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:35,918
if you didn't work in the field

1098
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,879
it would be very very difficult to

1099
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:41,440
answer them correctly

1100
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:42,560
very difficult um and i know like the

1101
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,720
cyber mentor

1102
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,918
um heath adams has talked about i

1103
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:48,158
mentioned like it's a difficult one

1104
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:50,319
because of the scenario based questions

1105
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,359
it's and it's not like uh like stand

1106
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,879
certs or like

1107
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,399
you know these uh e-learning certs where

1108
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:56,159
you have you know

1109
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:57,440
open books or internets or the internet

1110
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:00,800
or anything you you

1111
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,800
go in closed book and that's it

1112
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:06,160
650 bucks for four months so i'm not bad

1113
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,839
we're not doing too bad on price

1114
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:10,319
the certified penetration testing

1115
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:14,240
professional this is a 600

1116
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:16,800
1600 uh cert that you get materials labs

1117
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:18,078
all that good stuff it's uh two to four

1118
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,119
months of consistent studying would

1119
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:21,040
argue that you're probably gonna need to

1120
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:23,839
do about three to four hours a day

1121
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,240
um it's a seven day hands-on penetration

1122
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:25,920
test

1123
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:28,078
with an additional seven days of report

1124
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,599
writing it's a real world black box pen

1125
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:31,040
test so for those of you looking to get

1126
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,800
into the field if you get this cert it

1127
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,400
says hey i know actually how to do this

1128
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,480
in a real world sense

1129
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,320
not like a like a ctf like a real world

1130
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,440
sense passing without industry

1131
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,599
experience

1132
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,040
it's going to be challenging and like i

1133
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,119
said 600 bucks so you're looking at

1134
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,680
about 400 bucks a month

1135
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:49,280
then we have the creme de la creme the

1136
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,879
offensive security certified for

1137
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,599
certified professional

1138
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,079
um you're going to spend about i would

1139
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,240
say

1140
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,760
probably about 1500 bucks on materials

1141
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,479
labs vouchers all that good stuff for

1142
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,079
this

1143
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,920
you're gonna spend about six to twelve

1144
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:05,599
months to take this

1145
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:07,680
if you do it unless awesome on you but

1146
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:09,359
um you know it's a difficult exam you

1147
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,960
gotta use hack the box try hacking phone

1148
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:11,598
hub for extra study materials just so

1149
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,599
you can

1150
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:15,440
understand things at a different level

1151
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:18,079
the exam is 48 hours you got

1152
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,040
24 hours of uh of a hands-on experience

1153
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:22,480
that will just

1154
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:25,200
condition you and break you um

1155
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,079
it's a ctf-like challenge but it is not

1156
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,960
easy by

1157
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:30,560
any means and then you have a 24-hour

1158
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,440
span to write a report that you then

1159
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,119
submit

1160
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,960
um you have five machines that vary in

1161
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,880
difficulty and you have to get a 70

1162
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,839
to pass and then passing without

1163
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:41,280
industry experience it's really

1164
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:43,759
difficult

1165
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,520
um and then i wanted to give this so for

1166
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,079
those of you looking at the oscp it's a

1167
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,720
different

1168
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:50,320
type of certification as opposed to

1169
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,319
elearn i love e-learning security

1170
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,400
because they really teach you the

1171
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,359
techniques tactics and procedures on how

1172
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,880
to do things

1173
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:59,040
offensive security is more like a

1174
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:01,920
grueling experience

1175
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:03,279
it conditions you into a offensive

1176
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,200
security engineer

1177
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,800
right so the training platform with

1178
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,839
elearn is a good way to build up

1179
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,240
technical chops

1180
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:11,599
offensive security is just a mind boggle

1181
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,598
that grinds you

1182
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,599
and pumps you out as a as a different

1183
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:19,280
breed of security engineer

1184
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:21,040
um i also would like to shout out to my

1185
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,119
one of my buddies who works with me

1186
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,800
glenn moran who actually got his pass

1187
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:27,200
on the certification today so

1188
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:29,839
congratulations to him

1189
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:31,359
so try harder is isn't just a creed it's

1190
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:33,440
a way of life it's transformative and

1191
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:34,400
that's 100 true that was my buddy chris

1192
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,160
who said that

1193
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,320
um he mentioned that to me on my first

1194
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:41,359
time when i took this exam and failed it

1195
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:43,040
um the oc pre oscp is a process unlike

1196
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,560
any other certification out there it's

1197
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,000
going to condition you and prepare you

1198
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,119
to think like an offensive security

1199
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,800
engineer

1200
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:50,240
um and it's really going to push your

1201
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,920
limits and push you out of your comfort

1202
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,759
zone so the real cost of this

1203
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,680
is priceless the entire journey is

1204
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,640
priceless of course there's a monetary

1205
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,839
value to it

1206
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,319
but once you're done it's it's relieving

1207
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:04,240
and it's

1208
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:05,839
it's amazing so

1209
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,680
so the road map this is the cost

1210
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:08,560
analysis i want to mention so first year

1211
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,240
second year

1212
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,599
right we're looking at a total of two

1213
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,479
hundred twenty four hundred dollars on

1214
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:14,240
the first year

1215
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,760
thirty seven hundred dollars on the

1216
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,040
second year um

1217
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,640
we are running short on time so i'm

1218
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,480
going to kind of like glimpse past this

1219
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,078
a little bit i will publish the publish

1220
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:25,440
the site

1221
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:27,520
publish the slides in uh discord

1222
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,960
when we're all done so that way you can

1223
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,960
uh use these for later

1224
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,240
um and then there the talk will also be

1225
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,880
published later um

1226
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,919
on youtube so but look at this know that

1227
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,720
that's about the money that you're going

1228
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,800
to be spending

1229
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,839
and it's only about what 6 500 bucks

1230
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,119
give or take

1231
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:42,480
that's really cheap for a bunch of

1232
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,680
certifications that are going to really

1233
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,680
push your career

1234
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,598
and get you a six-figure income if

1235
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,598
that's what you know part of the

1236
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:50,720
part of the game right because we all

1237
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,320
want to make sure we get a return on our

1238
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,680
investment a lot of times it's monetary

1239
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,520
values right

1240
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,720
so degrees versus certifications that's

1241
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,240
a big thing

1242
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,919
degrees help build your network because

1243
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,040
of the alumni groups that you become a

1244
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,560
part of

1245
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,800
they teach you business processes you

1246
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:06,560
understand people influence culture

1247
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,160
um mbas are going to really help you do

1248
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,040
that phds are really going to help you

1249
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,480
do that

1250
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,320
they keep you accountable you have to

1251
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,440
turn in assignments right otherwise you

1252
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,720
fail

1253
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,200
and some provide you with high-level

1254
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,240
technical skills uh even technical phds

1255
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,000
are doing

1256
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:22,640
a thing now right the phd that i'm doing

1257
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,880
is highly technical

1258
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,960
certifications provide accredited

1259
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,160
accredited proof of knowledge

1260
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,680
right so that means that you are

1261
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,480
accredited and certified by a governing

1262
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,839
body that you're

1263
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:36,400
able to understand this right

1264
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:39,599
uh provide technical skill sets right

1265
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:42,400
the ejpt pen test plus

1266
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:42,800
pcpt and the oscp and then some required

1267
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,320
for

1268
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:47,200
dod or compliance those are the asserts

1269
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:49,760
that you can get to help get you a job

1270
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,960
uh security plus ch and oscp obviously

1271
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,079
osp's the big ones

1272
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:56,720
maybe not go after that one first um

1273
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:57,839
and then jobs often require them because

1274
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,759
of hr filters

1275
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:01,520
uh i saw somebody post on twitter

1276
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,800
yesterday that they have oscp but they

1277
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,440
couldn't get a job as a penetration

1278
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,960
tester because they didn't have ceh

1279
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,040
that's the kind of silliness that we see

1280
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,880
with hr filters so you kind of have to

1281
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,400
play the game we don't make the game we

1282
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,880
just played it right so we have to kind

1283
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,200
of

1284
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:17,760
go and go with the punches of the uh of

1285
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,759
the industry

1286
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:23,040
the other big question is why not just

1287
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:24,960
do both degrees provide your career to

1288
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:27,440
excel and certifications provide your

1289
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:30,480
technical skills to excel

1290
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:33,440
so why not both do it all

1291
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:35,760
you got plenty of time programming

1292
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,359
python bash ruby c and java so

1293
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,440
python bash and ruby are good for

1294
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:41,279
scripting um i've really been getting

1295
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,839
big into ruby lately because i'm trying

1296
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:46,079
to develop aws metasploit modules

1297
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:47,680
um so i'm having a lot of fun with that

1298
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:49,599
so if you are interested in

1299
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,879
developing metabolic modules look at

1300
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,800
ruby um

1301
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,319
bash and python are just really good

1302
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,160
scripting um

1303
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:57,520
languages python you're going to learn

1304
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,359
you can use that to write exploits and

1305
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:03,520
things like that

1306
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:05,920
and yes i did mean excel sorry typos

1307
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:08,319
gamephd canada can't even type or spell

1308
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:12,880
correctly

1309
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:15,680
um c and java those are what a lot of uh

1310
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,480
uh exploits are written in so um for

1311
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,839
those of you that go through like the

1312
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,480
oscp and stuff too you're going to see a

1313
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:21,520
lot of

1314
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,720
exploits written in c in java

1315
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,400
other knowledge you're going to want to

1316
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:26,160
know obviously the domains of windows

1317
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,079
linux networking and software

1318
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,520
cloud is a big topic right now and if

1319
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,720
you learn that you're going to be able

1320
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,480
to be competitive

1321
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,839
highly recommend going into cloud if you

1322
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,160
can um

1323
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:37,200
because it's just a new technology and

1324
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,118
um

1325
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:41,118
it's it's gonna it's going to become

1326
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:42,079
more than just like deploying ec2

1327
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:44,880
instances like

1328
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:45,760
there's um cloud business intelligence

1329
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,640
platforms

1330
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,440
there's a lot of different things that

1331
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,040
cloud

1332
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,359
i feel like everything is being directed

1333
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:55,200
to the cloud in the next 10 years or so

1334
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:56,720
um and on-prem stuff while it will still

1335
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:01,919
be there will

1336
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:03,520
almost start to become an afterthought

1337
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,960
so here's those high level road maps

1338
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,960
what's up

1339
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,480
so six months to two years at a help

1340
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,040
desk position this is the help desk to

1341
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,560
pin test track by the way

1342
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,319
while you're in that position why not

1343
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,599
get security plus right

1344
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:17,279
and in six months to two years i

1345
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:19,040
guarantee you'll get into like some kind

1346
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,800
of sysadmin net admin

1347
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:23,040
maybe some kind of security engineering

1348
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,480
position once you're at level two

1349
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,079
where you see right there under assist

1350
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,960
admin look at start getting some other

1351
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:29,760
certs like ch pintest plus ejpt to start

1352
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:33,200
propelling

1353
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:34,960
your career into security and then

1354
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,799
go get a security engineer position

1355
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,319
remember to while we're doing all this

1356
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,480
besides the certifications you can also

1357
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:43,279
get a degree um

1358
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,880
and and utilize your network that's you

1359
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:48,079
know rule numero no

1360
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,520
utilize your network um and so while

1361
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:52,880
you're a security engineer

1362
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:53,920
get uh ecppt by either security or oscp

1363
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,560
or both

1364
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:58,079
um and then once you have those certs

1365
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,359
you can get into red teaming and pen

1366
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:01,520
testing

1367
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:02,400
while you know they're not required to

1368
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:05,359
do it it

1369
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,880
is always pretty good um and this is a

1370
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:09,759
pretty common path that people

1371
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,640
people go on and then obviously after

1372
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,440
that you can go

1373
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:15,359
into management become a director um you

1374
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:18,560
know maybe even become an executive

1375
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:20,880
ciso cso um you know it's

1376
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,759
the the world is yours you know so says

1377
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:25,040
tony montana

1378
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:28,319
so um you know just

1379
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:30,319
use this as a template and you know

1380
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:31,839
feed in your own data into it and know

1381
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:33,599
that you know you can go from

1382
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:35,759
a help desk to becoming a pen tester

1383
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:41,839
within less of two years and i

1384
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:41,839
it's pretty common for that to happen

1385
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,078
so this is the student to pin test track

1386
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,759
this is another one that i see where

1387
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:49,920
students become pen testers

1388
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,839
um you know you go through your fall

1389
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,520
spring internship stuff while you're

1390
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:55,599
doing an internship get a cert

1391
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,880
i see a lot of interns just work and

1392
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,480
then that's it

1393
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,920
and that's great but why not get a

1394
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,119
certain while you're doing it you might

1395
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,800
even be able to get your company to pay

1396
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:05,359
for it

1397
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,720
degree programs you see the list there

1398
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:09,119
comp size cyber security

1399
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:11,200
info tech i'm sorry information

1400
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:13,200
technology and informatics

1401
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:15,279
once you get out of uh school you know

1402
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,960
look at an entry-level position

1403
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,480
whatever job that is it doesn't matter

1404
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:21,520
whether it's in security

1405
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:23,839
or it's not in security right

1406
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,960
take an entry level tech position or a

1407
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:26,480
level one

1408

with the industry and then boom find

1412
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:34,560
your mark and get into pen testing

1413

so here's a question um that somebody

1442
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,040
wanted answered so

1443
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,560
how to get into pin testing with certs

1444
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,599
but no experience right because you hear

1445
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:37,119
a lot about that

1446
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:38,400
i hear a lot um sign up for blog bounty

1447
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:40,079
programs

1448
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,520
do crowdsource pin testing platforms

1449
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:44,000
such as kobold io

1450
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:45,119
and synack find those internships use

1451
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,920
your network

1452
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:49,359
and what and big thing is be humble you

1453
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,079
know don't say don't just think because

1454
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:51,680
you have a

1455
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:53,680
security certification or even if you

1456
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:56,078
have oscp that you're all of a sudden

1457
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:58,720
some big hot shot guru pen tester

1458
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:59,920
um you know you you have to be humble

1459
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,279
otherwise nobody's going to want to work

1460
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:04,560
with you

1461
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:04,560
as harsh as that may sound

1462
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,400
and then take security related roles

1463
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,759
with a company where you want your pen

1464
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,440
testing career to go so if you want to

1465
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:13,200
go work for a big tech company maybe and

1466
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:15,839
you can't get a pin testing job

1467
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,640
um think about just you know going and

1468
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:20,078
working for him

1469
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:20,078
in a typical security position

1470
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,920
it looks like we're about five minutes

1471
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,839
to my time so

1472
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,960
which is good because we're closing up

1473
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:28,319
so closing thoughts

1474
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,240
how'd you go on your journey into

1475
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:32,079
infosec pin testing

1476
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:33,919
whatever it is that you decide to do

1477
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:35,440
with your life

1478
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,880
you're gonna start and you're gonna have

1479
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,160
a lot of ambition you're gonna have

1480
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,119
you're gonna be hungry you're gonna be

1481
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,160
so hungry

1482
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:42,240
and then you're gonna fail you're gonna

1483
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,920
hit a ditch you're gonna hit a wall

1484
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:45,680
but make sure when you do that then you

1485
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,560
get back up or if you fall make sure

1486
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,319
that you make a

1487
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,599
make a fall forward that way when you

1488
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:51,520
get up you at least have a little bit of

1489
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:54,079
forward progress right

1490
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:55,200
and when you fail be humble and think

1491
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:57,440
about why you failed

1492
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,319
what did you do wrong and from there

1493
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,599
you're going to learn

1494
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:00,720
you're going to learn what you did wrong

1495
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:02,560
and you're going to be able to use it as

1496
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:04,319
a learning experience a lesson learned

1497
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,759
and be able to grow from that because

1498
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:10,079
security is a journey

1499
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:12,560
and it's not a destination and with that

1500
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:13,599

yeah i was going to say go ahead and

1549
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:54,160
watch the discord but answer the

1550
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:56,720
questions on the stream

1551
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:57,200
for people who are not on the discord

1552
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,118
okay

1553
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:02,399
so on the twitch stream you read the

1554
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:07,359
questions before you answer

1555
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:07,359
oh go ahead is anybody else sorry

1556

uh it doesn't look like there's anything

1557
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:16,240
on the twitch stream somebody said 20 or

1558
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:18,079
24 000 maybe i made a wrong number uh

1559
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,959
