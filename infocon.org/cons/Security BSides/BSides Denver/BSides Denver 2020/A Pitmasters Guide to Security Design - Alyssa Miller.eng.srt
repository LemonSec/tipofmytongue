00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,720
especially those who might be on the

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
east coast

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,000
if we got any folks hanging out out

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,359
there it's actually getting

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,160
kind of mid-evening now so um i'm alyssa

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,160
miller as

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,840
was already stated and let me just begin

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,280
for those of you that don't know me by

15
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,600
introducing myself

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,480
uh so first and foremost i'm a hacker

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,280
and researcher

18
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,839
i have been hacking computers playing

19
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,360
with computers doing all this fun stuff

20
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,640
um well pretty much my entire life i

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,320
mean i can go back to when i was four

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,760
years old and my father used to bring a

23
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,559
computer home from work over the

24
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,680
holidays

25
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,519
so he could close accounting books to at

26
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,000
12 years old when i

27
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,160
bought myself a computer um so we're

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,920
talking like early 90s here late 80s

29
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,238
that that wasn't typical most people

30
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,360
didn't have computers in their homes yet

31
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,200
um yeah i my first hacks were in prodigy

32
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,200
trying to get into games that i wanted

33
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,240
to play without having to pay for them

34
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,600
um and it's you know i i went through

35
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,720
years as a developer

36
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,559
and ultimately became a pen tester

37
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,720
and all sorts of other fun stuff i've

38
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,560
been doing security for 15 years

39
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,320
um and where i find myself right now is

40
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,400
a company called sneak and i work as a

41
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,039
security advocate which means

42
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,040
my job is to get out into the community

43
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,560
and talk about things that matter in

44
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,040
terms of security

45
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,680
and i blog i do research projects other

46
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,600
things it's

47
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,119
kind of a pretty cool gig i'm not gonna

48
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,280
lie i'm also an

49
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,399
author and a blogger uh when i say

50
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,840
author i

51
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:50,479
am totally uh

52
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,520
you know in the midst of writing a book

53
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,720
right now so

54
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,399
i can't tell you the name because we

55
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,000
haven't really settled on a title yet

56
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,759
but hey you know

57
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,079
that's uh we'll we'll get there

58
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,399
eventually but writing a guide actually

59
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,919
uh to help people find their way into a

60
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,079
security career since

61
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,600
we all know that uh finding jobs in

62
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,799
security especially an entry level kind

63
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,160
of sucks

64
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:15,040
um and then finally i am the co-host

65
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,359
of a podcast called the uncommon journey

66
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,519
i

67
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,680
host that with chloe mustaghi and philip

68
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,560
wiley if you recognize those names at

69
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,040
all

70
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,760
um and yeah we we interviewed a lot of

71
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,720
great people

72
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,480
focused on their uncommon journeys into

73
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,879
cyber security

74
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,920
now the most important part for this

75
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,480
talk though

76
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,079
is i'm also a i guess you could say

77
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,399
amateur because i don't get paid to do

78
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:42,560
it amateur pit master

79
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,800
um i've been making barbecue for years

80
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,160
and i got started honestly because i

81
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,519
live in wisconsin

82
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,840
yeah a little dark scene here just a

83
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:53,360
little bit

84
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,800
and if you want actual real good

85
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,800
barbecue

86
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,480
you don't come to wisconsin for it so if

87
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,159
you want to and you live here you got to

88
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,359
make it yourself

89
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:05,840
and you know i've been doing

90
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,280
this for a long time i recently bought

91
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,480
the smoker that you see

92
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,840
here uh just brand new this year and

93
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,679
the timing couldn't have been better by

94
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,840
the way i mean literally buying this

95
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,720
wonderful smoker to replace an older one

96
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,640
i had

97
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,720
right at the start right before covet

98
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,799
hit perfect timing it was great

99
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,319
um but if you follow me on twitter or

100
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,599
anywhere else

101
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:30,000
you've uh you've seen

102
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,879
probably some tweets from me from time

103
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,920
to time

104
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,440
with pictures of meat maybe a wagyu

105
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,679
brisket

106
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,280
and i you know i've found other people

107
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,959
in our community who really enjoy

108
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,680
barbecuing as well

109
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,720
and it was through that discussion we

110
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,080
were talking about

111
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:51,280
a lot of the strategies that

112
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,400
uh are pretty well adopted in the world

113
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,480
of barbecue

114
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,080
you know barbecue is this interesting

115
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,200
thing it's kind of a mix

116
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,959
of a science and an art form so where

117
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,319
there's lots of things that every pit

118
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,080
master is going to kind of do

119
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,560
their own way and they're going to go

120
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,040
and do things just slightly differently

121
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,480
there's also those certain rules that

122
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,239
are just

123
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,079
they're tried and true and they pretty

124
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,120
much if you're gonna make anything

125
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,560
decent in terms of barbecue you

126
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,239
pretty much gotta follow them i mean

127
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,160
they're just they're they're the basics

128
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,880
of how you make good barbecue

129
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,160
and so we got into a discussion one day

130
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,880
and

131
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,479
started connecting it to security and i

132
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,400
realized you know

133
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:36,320
there's a lot of commonality between

134
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,080
these rules that we use to make good

135
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,560
barbecue

136
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,919
and what we need to do when we start

137
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,080
talking how we're going to secure our

138
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,639
enterprises it ended up turning in this

139
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,840
really

140
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,680
great metaphor and of course anytime you

141
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,000
come up with a good metaphor for how to

142
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,840
do

143
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,080
security that relates to something

144
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,840
really cool like barbecue

145
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,680
i mean you got to turn that into a talk

146
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,320
right so

147
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,160
that's where we find ourselves today so

148
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,240
let's talk a little bit about the breach

149
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,280
trends we're seeing right now

150
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,880
um you know

151
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,400
none of us i don't think if we've been

152
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,199
in security and you're paying attention

153
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,080
to

154
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,120
what's going on in the security world i

155
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,080
don't think any of us

156
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,199
it's a foreign concept that the cloud

157
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,479
environments have been

158
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:26,160
a primary target for breaches

159
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:29,599
we've seen countless stories of

160
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:32,800
s3 buckets being exposed to the internet

161
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,440
and uh you know titles like this one

162
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,919
here

163
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:39,680
of you know the latest in s3 breaches

164
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,758
but we're also seeing

165
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,759
increased activity around things like

166
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,440
containers so as we're moving and we're

167
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,000
doing more in the cloud

168
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,840
containers are one of those things that

169
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,960
are starting to become more and more of

170
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,599
a target

171
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,840
and we're starting to see

172
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:58,639
vulnerabilities within containers

173
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,359
have some really significant impact and

174
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,120
we'll get some

175
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,520
talking some more about that in a few

176
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,560
minutes and then finally there's

177
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,960
my favorite topic the internet of trash

178
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,919
or internet of things if you really want

179
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,520
to you know

180
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:15,840
be colliquial about it um

181
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,000
we're connecting everything to the

182
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:21,359
internet everything is becoming a

183
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,080
smart device um one of my favorite ones

184
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,000
i just

185
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,159
saw actually i've got two two really

186
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,440
great uh internet of trash stories for

187
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,639
you really quickly

188
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,800
one is a curling iron

189
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,240
and i struggle to understand why anybody

190
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,800
needs to control a

191
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:40,319
curling iron with their telephone

192
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,240
it's mind numbing to me and it makes you

193
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,120
wonder why are we doing why are we

194
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,639
connecting all of this stuff to the

195
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,919
internet just for the sake of connecting

196
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,400
it to the internet but it gets worse

197
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,440
like

198
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,280
as bad as i thought that was

199
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,280
did you know that there is someone had

200
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,559
put out a kickstarter to create a

201
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,559
candle that could be lit using your

202
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,080
smartphone

203
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,599
now what's really interesting about this

204
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:08,560
besides the obvious

205
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:10,880
fire hazard that is this situation it

206
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,479
it could only light the candle it

207
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,840
couldn't put it out

208
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,000
so like i started thinking about use

209
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:19,520
cases here why why do we do these

210
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,039
stupid things like okay i can light the

211
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,400
candle wouldn't it make more sense if i

212
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,919
could at least put the candle out so i

213
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,359
leave my house and i realized oh my god

214
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,960
i left that candle lit

215
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,960
click a button on my phone i put it up

216
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,080
nah no can't do that but you can light

217
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,359
it up so if you're you're

218
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,280
coming home with your date and you want

219
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,680
to create the right mood i guess

220
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,119
you could fire up a candle scary stuff

221
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,560
but this is what we're doing

222
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,720
and of course all these things

223
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,840
especially in iot space they all rely

224
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,639
again on cloud

225
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,758
and it's those cloud environments where

226
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,759
we're finding some of the most

227
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,560
significant breaches

228
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:55,039
so last year i was leading an

229
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,120
organization centered around

230
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,960
our assessment consulting services at a

231
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,000
previous employer

232
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,638
and every year we kind of did a look we

233
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,680
look back

234
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,919
on the previous year's

235
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,800
performance what we saw trends and

236
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,359
themes

237
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,280
in our our assessments our application

238
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,400
pen tests our network pen tests and so

239
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,878
forth

240
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,840
and what we saw was kind of interesting

241
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,520
and that was

242
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,039
maybe not surprising considering

243
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,799
everything we just talked about in terms

244
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,360
of cloud environments but

245
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,039
configuration management vulnerabilities

246
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,520
lead the way

247
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,479
more so than any other type of

248
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,718
vulnerability

249
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,640
we were finding things where there

250
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,959
wasn't a needed patch

251
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,399
there wasn't some you know tremendous

252
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,079
oday discovered

253
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,760
these were simple things if you just

254
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,279
configure the software right you would

255
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,560
be safer

256
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:48,000
but we find 40 percent of those tests

257
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,920
or 40 of the vulnerabilities i

258
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,240
identified through those tests to be

259
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,560
these configuration management issues

260
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,440
so then i look back i said well what has

261
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,439
it been

262
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,240
over the longer term and i went back and

263
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:03,760
you can see three years

264
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,440
very very steady right around that 40

265
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,519
percent mark

266
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,800
and in fact when i drew a linear trend

267
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,080
line through it which is that dotted

268
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,040
line you see in the middle

269
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,600
that sucker is flat it's r equals zero

270
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,839
there is

271
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,160
no slant to that there is no slope in

272
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,640
that line at all

273
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,319
now that tells us a really interesting

274
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,880
story that for the last three years

275
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,880
despite all these new technologies

276
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,959
despite any proven technologies all this

277
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,720
change the thing that we continue to get

278
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:34,000
wrong more than anything else is

279
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,399
how we're configuring our environments

280
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
that's a scary thought it also explains

281
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,600
why s3 buckets and other things are what

282
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,600
are being exposed

283
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,800
but the s3 buckets aren't the only cloud

284
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,240
technologies remember i mentioned

285
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,359
containers before

286
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,760
well what do you do when you're going to

287
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,839
build a container most people

288
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,880
don't build containers from scratch if i

289
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,160
want a docker image

290
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,080
i'm going to go out i'm going to grab a

291
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,600
base image from docker hub

292
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,519
and i'm going to build a docker file

293
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,320
that then structures out

294
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,519
my entire image in which my micro

295
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,880
service or something else is going to

296
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:06,399
run and it fires it up and it goes

297
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,439
a lot of people will go out to docker

298
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,680
hub and they're going to look for those

299
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,480
official images because there's a

300
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,079
there's an implied trustworthiness about

301
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,320
something in docker hub that's labeled

302
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:19,439
as an official image

303
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,640
well just a few months ago uh as part of

304
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,720
a research project

305
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,800
for the state of open source security

306
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,920
report that we published at sneak

307
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:31,120
back in june i took a look at

308
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:33,680
all at the top 10 official images

309
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,079
in docker hub and looked at the known

310
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,519
vulnerabilities in those images and this

311
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,800
is the performance and you can see this

312
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,560
is year over year because we did the

313
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,399
same thing in 2018

314
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,680
and what we see is it had it was scary

315
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,720
in 2018

316
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:49,359
in 2019 it didn't get any better that

317
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,000
node base image by itself is pretty

318
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:55,360
terrifying when you see 642

319
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,959
known vulnerabilities in that official

320
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,480
base image for node

321
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,560
and all i did was i mean i grabbed the

322
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,200
latest tag for each of these

323
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,199
and you can see the others are far less

324
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,760
that node one is kind of the outlier but

325
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,600
even

326
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:12,319
66 83 78 these are all high numbers for

327
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,120
known vulnerabilities

328
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,880
so what the the moral of the story here

329
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,680
is just grabbing an official image

330
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,800
doesn't make you

331
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,560
more secure and what about

332
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,240
vulnerabilities in open source

333
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,680
we think about docker hub those are open

334
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,200
source containers

335
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,880
what about when we think about the rest

336
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,720
of the open source community

337
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,160
we've been talking about open source

338
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,880
software for

339
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,560
about as long as i've been in security

340
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,000
and the fact of the matter is the more

341
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,680
these ecosystems grow

342
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,320
things like the javascript ecosystem

343
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,560
with package managers like npm or in

344
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,440
java you've got maven

345
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,839
we find that there's no way to get away

346
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,880
from

347
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:54,000
open source if you've got a 500 000

348
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:56,480
line application

349
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,320
in your organization the chances are the

350
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,519
majority of that is not code written by

351
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,720
your developers

352
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,959
but code that came from the open source

353
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,000
market repositories that are out there

354
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,760
on github

355
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,360
and when we look at the vulnerabilities

356
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,959
being reported in there what we see is

357
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,680
it's a lot of the same

358
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,399
old thing we see cross-site scripting we

359
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,880
see

360
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,079
you know denial of service and rce all

361
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,040
these things

362
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:22,399
this is these are identified

363
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,560
vulnerabilities that exist

364
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,160
in the open source community these are

365
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,719
things that developers

366
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,319
especially working in a devops

367
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,800
potentially cicd

368
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,160
type paradigm are introducing to your

369
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,800
software

370
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,639
so the challenge is i don't have to tell

371
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,760
any of you if you're in security you

372
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:44,240
know the complex space of what it is

373
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:48,240
that we're trying to secure

374
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:51,040
so i got to thinking how does

375
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,000
barbecue serve as a metaphor for the

376
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:56,079
things that we can

377
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,880
do to make our environments more safe

378
00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:01,599
so i've got five rules five rules that

379
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,760
every pit master must follow

380
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,360
that serve as terrific metaphors for how

381
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,480
we should also be approaching

382
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,399
our cyber security infrastructure so

383
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,880
let's get started let's get that brisket

384
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,760
on and

385
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,439
let's talk about some tasty barbecue and

386
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,800
let's also talk about how we're going to

387
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:22,560
shore up our defenses first

388
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:24,959
and foremost if i am planning a barbecue

389
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,638
the key word there is planning planning

390
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,319
and preparation wins the day

391
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,639
what you see in the background here is

392
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,519
me taking a brisket and trimming

393
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,800
that brisket i don't just decide one day

394
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,040
hey i'm gonna go

395
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,240
make a brisket at you know four o'clock

396
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,360
in the afternoon and throw

397
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,720
something on a smoker and go first of

398
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,240
all if i did that

399
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,839
i wouldn't be eating until about

400
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,920
midnight at least

401
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:51,920
and like any meat you buy that

402
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,519
meat coming from the butcher still needs

403
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,000
some prep it needs to be trimmed it

404
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:58,800
needs some dry rub it needs to be

405
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,560
re made ready to go on the smoker the

406
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,599
smoker itself that's a process that can

407
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:06,479
take anywhere from 8 to 10 to 12 hours

408
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,120
so i've got a plan days in advance and

409
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,040
know

410
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,720
how i'm going to approach this how am i

411
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,000
going to structure my day

412
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,040
around managing the fire in my smoker to

413
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,519
make sure that

414
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:21,279
everything turns out just perfect

415
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,839
well when it comes to security

416
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:25,519
initiatives we need to do the same

417
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,959
those of you that attended besides

418
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,560
denver you're going to recognize some of

419
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:31,359
this topic because

420
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,760
i talked about this in more detail last

421
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,079
year besides denver and that is

422
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,680
how do you win support for your cyber

423
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:40,000
security initiatives

424
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,359
you don't just go out and say hey you

425
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,920
know what we need this

426
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,880
really really cool tool and i'm just

427
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,800
gonna buy it

428
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,079
and i'm just gonna tell management hey

429
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,160
we need this

430
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,519
and i'm gonna go give me money to go buy

431
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,880
it it doesn't work that way we

432
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:57,040
understand that but we have to be

433
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:00,240
playing a long game in security

434
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:02,719
we have to understand that in order to

435
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,839
implement any security initiative i have

436
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,959
to be able to walk

437
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,560
into in many cases a board room

438
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,880
or at least an executive committee

439
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,599
meeting and justify

440
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,800
why it is that i want to do what i want

441
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,360
to do

442
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,479
now the issue is if i go in there and i

443
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,639
dump a lot of

444
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,880
fud i give them a bunch of fear

445
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,880
uncertainty and doubt

446
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,399
it doesn't work but this is what we've

447
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,880
done in security for years and years and

448
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,560
years

449
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,000
we say things like well it's not if you

450
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,680
get breached it's when and

451
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,360
we talk about all the horrible things

452
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,800
attackers can do

453
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:39,680
but the reality is that doesn't

454
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,079
motivate people to help us out that

455
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,758
doesn't

456
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,519
motivate people to take action

457
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,720
ultimately we want those executives

458
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,440
those board members

459
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,320
to take action by giving us money and

460
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,920
resources for our initiatives

461
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,839
a number of years ago north shore

462
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:57,599
university hospital

463
00:15:53,839 --> 00:16:00,639
did a study and their study

464
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,040
shows us the neuroscience behind

465
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,480
this situation so they looked at

466
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,279
problems they were having with

467
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,850
infections and in particular they traced

468
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,279
it back to

469
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:11,199
[Music]

470
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,120
medical practitioners not washing their

471
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:16,079
hands properly

472
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,839
so they started to they installed video

473
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,560
surveillance at all the hand washing

474
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,720
stations

475
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,160
and they told everybody about the video

476
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,000
surveillance they hung signs that said

477
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,880
hey you're on video be sure to wash your

478
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,800
hands

479
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,680
and what they found was they still got

480
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:33,439
less than 10 percent compliance

481
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:36,319
with their hand washing policies

482
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,560
so then they tried another step they put

483
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,720
up

484
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,040
signs and every time somebody

485
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,320
appropriately washed their hands

486
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,880
the sign would give them a little

487
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,320
congratulatory message

488
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,000
well what they found was when they did

489
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,040
that they got

490
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,440
90 percent compliance

491
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,800
and the reason why is this if i want to

492
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,480
discourage action

493
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,399
the best thing for me to do is to use

494
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,600
threats and fear because if you think

495
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:03,040
about it when somebody

496
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,959
fears a threat their first response

497
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,959
is kind of a fight or flight response

498
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,839
and most often as human beings we

499
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,240
respond

500
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,918
with flight we're going to do everything

501
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,240
we can to avoid

502
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,360
that threat it's only if we're forced to

503
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,559
deal with that threat that we're going

504
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,958
to go to fight

505
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:21,039
and so by using threats and fear all i'm

506
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,600
doing is discouraging action

507
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,959
if i tell them hey all these bad things

508
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:27,599
are going to happen

509
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,679
unless you do this well that's a threat

510
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:33,039
and instead of attributing that threat

511
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,720
to the you know the apts or whoever it

512
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,160
is out there that those threat actors

513
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,160
are going to be

514
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,000
their mind attributes it to you and

515
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,120
they're less likely to want to help you

516
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,520
out

517
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,280
now if i want to encourage action what i

518
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,360
need to do is offer rewards

519
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,280
just like that posit it could be simple

520
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,000
just like the positive messages on those

521
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,480
signs

522
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,080
got people to wash their hands we can do

523
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,080
the same thing when we're trying to win

524
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,720
support for our initiatives

525
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,600
but how do i do that what rewards can i

526
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,679
offer

527
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,799
well good reward is to just demonstrate

528
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,200
cost savings

529
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,080
how will this security initiative save

530
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,720
me costs

531
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,199
may be able to reduce the amount of time

532
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,919
that

533
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,520
our help desk spends rebuilding pcs or

534
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,799
helping people with their pcs after they

535
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,559
get infected

536
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,960
with malware because i'm going to

537
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:22,080
install some new next-gen endpoint

538
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,039
or something great that's that's a great

539
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,760
way to start

540
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,480
showing that reward what's even better

541
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,160
is if i can

542
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,039
show how that cost savings and that

543
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,400
resource savings allows us to tackle a

544
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,559
wish list item

545
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,919
every organization has that wish list

546
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,600
they're not able to get to because

547
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,799
either they don't have the money

548
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,199
they don't have the people or both and

549
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,240
so

550
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,720
by saving efficiency you know gaining

551
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,960
efficiency over here and saving money

552
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,000
i can oftentimes open up those wish list

553
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,080
items

554
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
the best thing though is if i can use a

555
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,639
security initiative to open up a new

556
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,919
line of business or revenue stream

557
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,720
for instance i worked with an

558
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,480
organization that managed

559
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,559
intellectual property centering on

560
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,320
patents and as they were going through a

561
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,000
cloud transformation the one thing they

562
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,678
didn't want to move

563
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,080
was their system that they used when

564
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,880
people made basic like an open records

565
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,399
request when

566
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,480
patents published people can request

567
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,760
certain records that were filed as part

568
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,400
of the patent

569
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,720
and so they still were looking for

570
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,000
people to do this very manual process

571
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,400
because they didn't trust their

572
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,280
cloud environment so as they were

573
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,679
looking to implement

574
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,120
casbi in their cloud environment and

575
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,039
they were trying to win support we just

576
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,479
demonstrated how that casby solution

577
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,160
would allow them to set up this

578
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,520
subscription service by which people

579
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,120
could come in and make those requests

580
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,200
for those materials

581
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,439
that was a new revenue stream and that

582
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,679
that went over huge the executives loved

583
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,200
it

584
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:48,320
they had a new line of business new

585
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,799
money coming in that gave real roi to

586
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,200
that

587
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,000
security expenditure which is always the

588
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,039
hardest thing to

589
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,039
find now if you're gonna do this you

590
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,720
need to also understand how do you talk

591
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,160
to the board or how do you talk to

592
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,360
senior managers

593
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:05,120
because it's not the same as going in

594
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,559
and giving a presentation to a customer

595
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,239
or something like that

596
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:11,280
first and foremost what you have to

597
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,679
understand is that

598
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,320
their time is very short and they're

599
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,799
very

600
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,158
used to operating in that way so unlike

601
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,960
how we've always been taught through

602
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,559
school like

603
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,240
hey you know tell them what you're going

604
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,678
to tell them then tell them it

605
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,600
then tell them what you told them that

606
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,360
whole strategy you don't do that walking

607
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,240
into a board meeting

608
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,760
you have three minutes to get your pitch

609
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,720
out there in front of them so as you

610
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,919
crack

611
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,600
your presentation the things that you

612
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,520
want them to hear and see the most

613
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,959
need to be the very first things you put

614
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,440
in front of their face

615
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,720
because after two to three minutes you

616
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,240
may get stopped

617
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:50,159
shut down you they may tune out

618
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,480
get it out there in front of them right

619
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:55,039
away and then support it with

620
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,720
your facts and all your detailed figures

621
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,158
and then you can summarize it at the end

622
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,840
if you still have time

623
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,000
the second is be prepared to get

624
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,799
interrupted because they are going

625
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,159
to interrupt they know exactly what

626
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,520
questions they have in their mind and

627
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,520
they're not going to wait until the end

628
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,679
of your presentation to ask them

629
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,280
so again this also plays into why you

630
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,679
need to have your main points

631
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,520
up front understand who you're talking

632
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,120
to and play to that

633
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,879
and then finally speaking of

634
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,879
understanding who you're talking to

635
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,000
anticipate their questions and have

636
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,960
answers

637
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,039
you can get away with one maybe two i

638
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,640
don't knows i'll have to look into that

639
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:34,640
type answers

640
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:36,400
after that you just look unprepared

641
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,159
take a few minutes to understand their

642
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,159
motivations their concerns and

643
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,720
anticipate what it is that they're going

644
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:45,200
to ask

645
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,640
so that's it for rule number one rule

646
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,919
number two

647
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:52,000
when making a brisket low and slow

648
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,960
you cannot rush it remember i said a

649
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,640
brisket can take

650
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,320
8 to 12 hours or sometimes even longer

651
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,200
that's because we're not cooking that

652
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,639
sucker at 400 degrees

653
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,640
if we did we would be eating the

654
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,919
toughest slice of cuta meat you could

655
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,840
ever imagine

656
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,120
instead as you see in the upper left

657
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,360
there

658
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,280
we're cooking at 225 degrees sometimes

659
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:16,399
maybe 250.

660
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,840
we want it to take long because

661
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,400
the other thing that we're going to do

662
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:23,760
is we're not cooking that meat to 130

663
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:26,880
or 140 degrees we're taking that meat

664
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,799
up to 200 degrees or more which is the

665
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,120
point when a brisket actually starts to

666
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,960
get

667
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,158
tender so if you did that at a really

668
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,840
high temperature

669
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:37,280
you dry out the brisket it'd be really

670
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:39,199
tough and it would just be awful

671
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,760
so we do it at a low temperature we

672
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,720
infuse all that really yummy smoked

673
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,879
taste

674
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,120
and what we get is this super tender

675
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,240
meat that's the whole point of smoking a

676
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,080
brisket

677
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,440
so when it comes to cyber security it's

678
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,960
the same story

679
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,679
we cannot boil the ocean you cannot

680
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,960
secure

681
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,520
everything tomorrow instead we need to

682
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,960
focus

683
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:05,200
on concepts of continuous improvement

684
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,200
so when people talk about ci cd i always

685
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,960
ask them what about the other ci

686
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,720
you know cicd being continuous

687
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,880
integration continuous deployment well

688
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,200
what about continuous improvement

689
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,240
what are we doing to constantly get

690
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,960
better and better

691
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:22,720
and better now when i talk cyber

692
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:24,080
security i bring up the castle metaphor

693
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,400
and i know some of you are cringing

694
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,120
right now we've heard castle metaphors

695
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,600
used for

696
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,399
decades in cyber security and really

697
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,959
they're usually

698
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,440
horrible but let me flip that usual

699
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:38,000
script on its head

700
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,679
what you see here is a perfect example

701
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,919
of a medieval castle

702
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:44,240
this one is in i want to say it's in

703
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,760
dover if i remember correctly

704
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,600
and in the middle of it you see this

705
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,360
large monolithic structure they call

706
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,959
that the keep and inside the keep is

707
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,678
where they put all their most critical

708
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,679
assets

709
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,880
the things they wanted to defend the

710
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,799
most

711
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,799
then they built around that keep all

712
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:00,080
these other you see concentric walls and

713
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,840
everything else they built all these

714
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,600
other defenses you see

715
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,879
moats which now it's a road it's no

716
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,959
longer filled with water

717
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,720
you see uh you know hills and open

718
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,799
fields and other things that were all

719
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,159
a part of the defensive nature but it

720
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,320
all started with that keep

721
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,440
that was built on the top of this hill

722
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,600
and that was the

723
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,520
most fortified structure their point of

724
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,279
last defense

725
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,639
we need to think about cyber security

726
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:24,960
that way and

727
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,880
to do that first of all we need to know

728
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,240
what are our critical assets what do we

729
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,159
care about most

730
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,080
and i'm not talking i t assets i'm

731
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,279
talking things like private data

732
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,279
if we're in healthcare those are

733
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:37,600
healthcare records if

734
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:39,120
we're in financial services it's you

735
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,639
know those financial records but

736
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,039
whatever it is

737
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,960
what private data do we have private

738
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,720
data that we care about is that what's

739
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,279
critical to our business and keeps our

740
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,640
business

741
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:54,159
in motion it might be critical functions

742
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,720
you think about ics and uh or if we

743
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,320
think about

744
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:00,000
utilities delivery they're just keeping

745
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,399
those functions running being

746
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,360
able to deliver those critical services

747
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,679
that

748
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,600
is a crucial asset for their business

749
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,200
that's what matters to them

750
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,199
financial assets of course are important

751
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,000
to every organization how do we protect

752
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,360
our money

753
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,880
we're in business to make money if we

754
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,320
don't have money to pay the bills and to

755
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,919
pay our people

756
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,720
we're out of business what about those

757
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,480
people

758
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,000
aren't they assets to us too and aren't

759
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,440
they assets that we have to defend with

760
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,600
our it systems

761
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,840
of course they are so we need to

762
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,039
understand what those assets are and

763
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,600
make sure that they're a part of our

764
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:35,200
keep and then finally all of our secrets

765
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,399
whether they're trade secrets whether

766
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,840
they're other things that we need to

767
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,200
protect from the marketplace

768
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,279
things that don't fit into any of these

769
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,480
other categories those other secrets

770
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:46,640
how do we defend those

771
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,640
that's what we need to be focused on

772
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,360
this is how we need to think of those

773
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,360
assets

774
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:54,080
and then we can start to talk about how

775
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,439
do we go about defending them

776
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,439
now when we defend them and i think

777
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:01,360
about that that

778
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:03,600
castle again we have basically three

779
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,600
types of defenses in a castle

780
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,678
first of all there's those preventative

781
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,240
defenses they're those things that are

782
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,200
very

783
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,240
just um you know they're like the walls

784
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,520
they don't really do anything they're

785
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,600
not active

786
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,918
they just stand there and and they kind

787
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:21,678
of they do their thing

788
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:24,799
um then we also have

789
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:26,320
those the archers and the more active

790
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,600
defenses that are preventative they're

791
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,720
the ones that are actively going to try

792
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,520
to stop

793
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,120
people coming in but then we also have

794
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,879
things like mitigation defenses and

795
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,479
mitigation defenses are meant just to

796
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,000
simply slow down

797
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,720
that incoming attack so you think about

798
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,640
those long yards between the walls

799
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,720
so even though somebody breached a wall

800
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,559
they now have to cross this yard and our

801
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,240
preventative defenses have time

802
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:50,158
to respond to them as they're crossing

803
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,840
that long yard or you think about that

804
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,720
moat it takes time to get across the

805
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,360
mode if the

806
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,960
drawbridge is up things like that and

807
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,879
then finally we have our detection

808
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,679
mechanisms which are those guards that

809
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,279
are watching

810
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,919
for people breaching the walls and other

811
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:05,440
defenses we need to do the same thing as

812
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,120
we build cyber security

813
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,240
you see we build those concentrically

814
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:12,879
out from our critical assets

815
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,919
and then it's just that continuous

816
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,520
improvement

817
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,360
it's identifying those assets

818
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,918
translating them to where they live in

819
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,719
the i.t

820
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:22,399
space establish small perimeters around

821
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,320
them defend those perimeters

822
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:26,000
we assess those defenses and then we

823
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,000
just repeat the process

824
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,559
that's how we get to continuous

825
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,559
improvement

826
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,679
pin master rule number three good smoke

827
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:38,879
is essential

828
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,679
dirty smoke will ruin you what you see

829
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,520
here is an

830
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,960
image of what we in the barbecue

831
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:46,879
business call clean

832
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:49,919
smoke clean smoke is almost

833
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:52,399
disappearing it's very blue in color

834
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,440
sometimes you can't see it at all but

835
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:55,279
it's not that big

836
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,880
billowy plumy white stuff when you have

837
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,559
that big billowy plumy white stuff that

838
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,880
means you're burning creosote

839
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,600
and creosote imparts an awful taste in

840
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,320
your meat

841
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,918
you don't want creosote getting created

842
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,678
in your burning process

843
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,520
so as i'm burning wood i'm looking for

844
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,640
that wood to burn very efficiently such

845
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,399
that it creates

846
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,559
only the small amount of smoke that you

847
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:17,279
can see on the slide here or maybe

848
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:18,480
there's so little actual smoke content

849
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:21,120
that all you see

850
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,880
is that visual distortion of the heat

851
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,239
that's what we're talking about when we

852
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,159
say clean smoke

853
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,799
and that's what gets us that beautiful

854
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:30,559
wonderful smoky taste in our barbecue

855
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:32,399
if that creosote gets into the food the

856
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:34,240
food is ruined it'll have that bitter

857
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:36,000
taste and there's nothing you can do to

858
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,600
get rid of it

859
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,360
but how does that apply to cyber

860
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:42,480
security

861
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,080
we need to think about metrics and i

862
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,880
know we talk about metrics a lot

863
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,240
but what what are we really doing with

864
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,279
our metrics

865
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,679
you know when i think about

866
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:53,919
vulnerability management how do i make

867
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:57,440
sure that i have

868
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:58,960
not just accurate metrics obviously i

869
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,399
want to know how many vulnerabilities am

870
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,520
i discovering how many vulnerabilities

871
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:06,000
am i fixing things of that nature

872
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,600
but how do i make them effective just

873
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,039
knowing that we fixed 200

874
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,678
vulnerabilities this quarter doesn't

875
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:14,480
tell me anything

876
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:16,000
maybe that i mean okay great i fixed 200

877
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,960
of them did i fix 200 of them because

878
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,320
we're fixing

879
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,360
vulnerabilities faster did i fix more of

880
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:24,320
them because they were all

881
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,199
low hanging low severity vulnerabilities

882
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,360
but we still got a bunch of high

883
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,720
severity vulnerabilities

884
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,520
is the number of vulnerabilities i'm

885
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:34,399
having to fix an indication that

886
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,200
we have more vulnerabilities coming into

887
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,559
our

888
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,399
vulnerability management database

889
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:41,039
because our developers are

890
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:43,039
creating more code with higher levels of

891
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:45,120
vulnerability

892
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:46,720
we need to understand metrics to a

893
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,399
greater level

894
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,760
we need to look at our metrics and be

895
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:52,000
able to draw a

896
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,039
better picture of what do they actually

897
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,080
mean

898
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:58,799
because the same metric the same

899
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,918
increase in a particular metric can be

900
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:02,000
good or bad

901
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:02,960
depending on its relationship to other

902
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,399
metrics

903
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,960
and that's what we need to be thinking

904
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:08,399
about as we start to build these out

905
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,240
of course metrics are important because

906
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:11,840
this is how we demonstrate

907
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,480
that those initiatives that we went to

908
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:16,639
the board to for and got

909
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,159
them to buy in and provide us funding

910
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,200
and resources for

911
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:22,960
this is how we show them hey we're

912
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,840
actually making progress we're doing the

913
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,679
things

914
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:30,158
that you told or that we told you we

915
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:31,919
would do it's having the expected impact

916
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,600
so we need to make sure that those

917
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:35,440
metrics are effective

918
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,678
so that when we look at them we can

919
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:42,320
discern them analyze them properly

920
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:43,919
and present a a more valid picture

921
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,840
and let's talk about how we present our

922
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:47,919
metrics for a minute

923
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,439
we're going to set goals we always set

924
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:50,960
goals on metrics

925
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,559
unfortunately what we do a lot of times

926
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,679
when we set metrics because we're trying

927
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,279
to make them

928
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:58,159
measurable and attainable stop me if

929
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,159
you've heard that before

930
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:04,799
we set them to arbitrary numbers

931
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:06,239
so on the right here you see attainment

932
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:09,519
oh we're going to fix

933
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:12,399
80 of our vulnerabilities in

934
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:13,919
six months well is that really an

935
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:16,320
effective goal

936
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:17,679
does that prove you've done anything

937
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,158
what if the 80

938
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:21,200
you fix are all low and medium severity

939
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,720
and the 20

940
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,360
that you didn't fix are all the critical

941
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:28,240
ones that are immediately exploitable

942
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,760
and you know have patches but you just

943
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,159
haven't applied

944
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,120
you haven't measured anything positive

945
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:36,799
it's still

946
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:38,799
not better so what we really want to

947
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:39,600
understand when we look at metrics is

948
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:42,639
how are we

949
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:46,719
improving and we want to set our goals

950
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:48,720
based on improvement not achievement

951
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,000
so again when i'm thinking of this idea

952
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,240
of continuous

953
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,360
improvement that's what i need to be

954
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,440
setting my goals for

955
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:58,639
how am i going to keep getting better

956
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,240
today than i was yesterday

957
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,000
and then when i think about these goals

958
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,600
and i think about these metrics and how

959
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,559
i'm going to present them

960
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:08,080
i need to be aware of the audience i

961
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:10,080
will tell you right now the very worst

962
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:12,320
thing you can do is walk into an

963
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,000
executive or board level meeting and

964
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,760
start throwing around all the metrics

965
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,760
numbers because when you come back the

966
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,879
next time and the numbers say something

967
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,760
different

968
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,919
even though they may indicate a better

969
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,760
overall picture

970
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:27,279
those executives are going to see those

971
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,080
individual numbers in question why did

972
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,840
they go down

973
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,000
instead of up why did they get worse

974
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:34,000
instead of better and now you're on your

975
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
back heels trying to explain

976
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,200
hey this is what this all means it's

977
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,039
actually a good thing

978
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,519
when all they're seeing are graphs that

979
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:44,158
are going the wrong direction

980
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:45,679
now conversely when you're working in

981
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,440
tactical teams

982
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:49,600
understanding a lot of those detailed

983
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,320
metrics are very important

984
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:54,080
and looking at the numbers and which

985
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,080
numbers you choose to look at

986
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,279
are going to change based on the level

987
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,199
of audience

988
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:01,120
that you're speaking to but what you

989
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,600
want to do is make sure that the story

990
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,918
that you're telling using your metrics

991
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,840
is appropriate for that audience

992
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:09,440
when you're talking to board level they

993
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,519
want to understand risks

994
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,960
they want to understand what does this

995
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:14,399
mean for the business

996
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,320
how could i lower this risk in a

997
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:17,840
different way how can i

998
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,519
address this without having to spend

999
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,600
money or how much money

1000
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,880
do i have to spend and what will it mean

1001
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,279
to me in terms of

1002
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,960
risk reduction when i'm talking with

1003
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:28,000
teens on the other hand i'm talking very

1004
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,360
technically

1005
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,080
and i'm talking about how do we get

1006
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:35,039
these numbers to change month over month

1007
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,519
quarter over quarter and so forth so

1008
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,360
being

1009
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,600
able to understand your audience and

1010
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:42,320
speak to the things that

1011
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,279
they think about on a daily basis is

1012
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,720
what's crucial

1013
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:46,720
when we start talking about metrics

1014
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:53,200
rule number four there is no

1015
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,799
set it and forget it now i'm gonna get

1016
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,559
some people are gonna argue with me i'm

1017
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:59,440
sure there are people out there

1018
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:01,360
um i i'll probably get a phone call or a

1019
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,039
tweet from dave kennedy or someone else

1020
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,639
who i know who loves their pellet

1021
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:06,158
smokers

1022
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,079
whole point of a pellet smoker is it's

1023
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:10,480
supposed to be set it and forget it so

1024
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,440
let's forget about pet pellet smokers

1025
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,000
for a moment

1026
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,119
and let's talk about stick burners or

1027
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,320
ones that burn

1028
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:19,599
wood in my opinion and this will be

1029
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:23,599
unpopular with some

1030
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:25,280
real smokers okay um the reality is

1031
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:27,040
there is no set and forget i have to

1032
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:30,240
constantly be watching

1033
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:31,839
the temperature in that smoke box

1034
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:34,000
am i getting the right temperature to

1035
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:37,599
the meat am i getting the right level of

1036
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,320
smoke i have to tend to that fire every

1037
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:41,119
so often

1038
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,159
you know generally when i'm smoking meat

1039
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:43,760
every hour

1040
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,599
hour and a half i'm going out and i'm

1041
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,040
adding wood to the fire

1042
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:48,960
to make sure that i can maintain a

1043
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:51,119
proper temperature i might have to

1044
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,280
adjust dampers to make sure

1045
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:55,280
that you know i'm getting enough air

1046
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,119
into the fire to make it hot enough

1047
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,480
or to cool things off if it's getting

1048
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:00,240
too hot

1049
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,000
don't want to overcook my meat i don't

1050
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:05,279
want to undercook my meat

1051
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,640
i want to get done on time so when we

1052
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,359
think about

1053
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:11,000
you guessed it continuous improvement

1054
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:13,759
how do we apply that to

1055
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,599
devsecops

1056
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:18,640
so devsecops we have this really

1057
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:21,040
interesting situation

1058
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:23,279
we in security have known about devops

1059
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:26,000
since 2008 when it was the first

1060
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,520
paper was written on it we've been

1061
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,040
trying to insert ourselves into that

1062
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,440
picture ever since and we've been

1063
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:33,119
failing miserably

1064
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,680
there's a couple reasons for that first

1065
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:38,320
and foremost with devops and cloud

1066
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:40,720
native technology and ci cd

1067
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,599
what we have are three conflicting

1068
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,279
motions

1069
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,119
we've got security pushing left we're

1070
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,720
trying to we've been talking about

1071
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,079
hey security's gonna push left we need

1072
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,399
to push left we need to get earlier in

1073
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,920
the

1074
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,440
cycle we've been talking about that as

1075
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,359
long as i've been in security and even

1076
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,119
before when i was still a developer

1077
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,480
that's like two decades of talking about

1078
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:59,280
pushing left

1079
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:01,040
but we still struggle with it meanwhile

1080
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,720
because of things like containers and

1081
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,960
infrastructure as code

1082
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,560
kubernetes all these wonderful cool new

1083
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,640
technologies that are being launched in

1084
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,320
cloud native environments

1085
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:12,720
we have developers pushing further and

1086
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,920
further right they're defining the very

1087
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:17,680
infrastructure on which

1088
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:21,440
their software is going to run and then

1089
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:23,520
once again because you have that

1090
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,680
you've now got your ops folks who are

1091
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,520
pushing up the stack

1092
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,720
instead of being able to focus on

1093
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,040
hardware

1094
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,160
and you know low-level operating system

1095
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,920
stuff

1096
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:36,319
they're having to understand this

1097
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,720
infrastructure as code they're having to

1098
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,400
they need to be excuse me to be able to

1099
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:43,040
read things like yaml

1100
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:45,599
and to be able to look at docker files

1101
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:48,640
and understand what's going on there

1102
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:51,839
and be able to interpret that so

1103
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,640
we have these conflicting motions where

1104
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:55,680
security

1105
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:58,720
fails is that security

1106
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:00,640
has traditionally introduced friction i

1107
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:03,680
have been to

1108
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:06,839
no fewer than a hundred different talks

1109
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:08,000
on how to implement security in

1110
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:11,440
devsecops

1111
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:14,480
and to a t save for maybe

1112
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:17,040
two or three of them every

1113
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:19,119
single one of them has talked about what

1114
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,839
we've done in security forever

1115
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:23,520
and it's the thing that doesn't work in

1116
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:24,640
devops and that is this idea of creating

1117
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,119
gates

1118
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:28,480
well before your your user story moves

1119
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,400
from the backlog to

1120
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,920
code and commit you need to do threat

1121
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,680
modeling and then

1122
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,040
once they commit the code you need to do

1123
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,720
sas and sca

1124
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,480
and make sure you scan it and then after

1125
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,359
we build and test it then we need to do

1126
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,280
dast and

1127
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:44,240
at each of these gates if it fails we're

1128
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:46,880
going to kick them back to the left

1129
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:48,560
that doesn't work those feedback cycles

1130
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,320
take a long time

1131
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,599
and it breaks the it definitely breaks

1132
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,960
the cicd model

1133
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:56,560
it even breaks an agile devops model

1134
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,240
this is what we need to get away from

1135
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,400
and we need to think about things

1136
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,879
that i term and you'll hear term in the

1137
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:05,599
marketplace frictionless enablement

1138
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,359
how do i make security frictionless and

1139
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:09,440
the key to that is instead of being

1140
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:12,240
gates between these phases

1141
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,040
we need to bring security as an inherent

1142
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,680
part

1143
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:17,440
of those phases so threat modeling

1144
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:20,240
happens in the backlog

1145
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,880
sca and s bomb creating an s bomb that

1146
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,359
happens

1147
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,320
in the coding and commit cycles sas and

1148
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:27,920
das are part

1149
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:30,160
of the test process they're not separate

1150
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,160
we do container security all these

1151
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,520
things need to be part of those phases

1152
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:36,078
we cannot

1153
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:38,000
have them as pieces that are going to

1154
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:40,560
kick us back to the left in terms of the

1155
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,680
pipeline now how do we do that

1156
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:44,078
well we need to meet them where they

1157
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:46,480
live first and foremost as

1158
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:48,079
security practitioners in a devsecops

1159
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,800
environment you need to be working

1160
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:52,320
with devs on a daily functional basis

1161
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,640
attending stand-ups

1162
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,760
going to their meetings being a part of

1163
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,400
sprint planning

1164
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,040
doing job shadowing creating things like

1165
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,079
that

1166
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:03,359
mutual engagement by working together

1167
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:06,079
day to day

1168
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:07,119
building empathy because ultimately what

1169
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:09,760
you're trying to do

1170
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:11,839
is pave the road for them to make

1171
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,480
security truly frictionless

1172
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:16,640
we need to make security the path that

1173
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:19,119
is secure that we want them to follow

1174
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,720
the easiest path for them to follow

1175
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,720
because what we've seen in security

1176
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,720
forever is that the more obstacles we

1177
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,560
create

1178
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,000
the more shortcuts they'll create to go

1179
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:30,640
around them so

1180
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,640
we do have to focus on automation but

1181
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,160
automation alone doesn't do it we cannot

1182
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,920
forget about the other steps here and

1183
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:38,240
include the people and processes

1184
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,240
in that but when we can create those

1185
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,319
people we can create those processes we

1186
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:44,959
can engage those people together

1187
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,000
and we can provide tools that automate

1188
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,280
much of this

1189
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,640
now we can trust the developers to do

1190
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:54,400
those security steps

1191
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:54,400
and they're more willing to adopt them

1192
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,480
finally pit master rule number five know

1193
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:02,720
your tools

1194
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:05,040
your abilities and your limitations

1195
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,160
check out this smoker this is a

1196
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:10,160
colleague of mine

1197
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:13,920
who recently bought this smoker

1198
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:16,640
this thing's crazy i it's 700 gallons

1199
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:19,599
of smoking space plus you can see

1200
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:22,160
there's also two very large rotisseries

1201
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:22,800
i look at that and i'm like there is no

1202
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,839
way

1203
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:27,280
i could use that one i just don't have

1204
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:29,440
enough people to cook for

1205
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,520
that's a lot of meat going on there now

1206
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,800
he does things professionally i don't

1207
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:35,520
smoker like that doesn't make a lot of

1208
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,520
sense for me it does for him

1209
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,520
for me i would be lost with something

1210
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:42,079
like that just trying to manage the fire

1211
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:44,000
on something like that even as much

1212
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:45,119
experience as i have with smoking it's

1213
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,520
just too much

1214
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:49,040
that's too much tool for me why would i

1215
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,960
ever go out and buy that

1216
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,240
when instead i've got this the super

1217
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,839
nice smoker that does

1218
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:56,479
everything i needed to do and i can

1219
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:58,560
manage it easily

1220
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,480
so where this plays into security is we

1221
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,440
know security does not have unlimited

1222
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,400
budgets

1223
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,560
and in fact according to this survey

1224
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:09,599
from help net security

1225
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:12,400
going into 2020

1226
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:15,280
you know a lot of organizations were

1227
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:17,599
talking about things decreasing

1228
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,960
yeah we see a lot that we're planning to

1229
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:21,280
increase as well

1230
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,800
and that was good it was a great picture

1231
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:27,119
ultimately

1232
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:30,720
the majority here were increasing

1233
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:33,839
but then what happened covet hit

1234
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,480
those budgets have dried up so it's

1235
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:36,880
become

1236
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,680
once again incumbent on us as security

1237
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,319
professionals

1238
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,839
to spend our money more wisely now when

1239
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:43,759
we go to the marketplace the marketplace

1240
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:45,599
tells us this

1241
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,680
here's everything that you need you need

1242
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:49,359
a tool out of every one of these buckets

1243
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:51,919
and sometimes maybe multiple tools out

1244
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:54,480
of every one of these buckets

1245
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,160
no one's going to buy all this the fact

1246
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,400
of the matter is that security industry

1247
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:00,799
is 177 billion dollar

1248
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,560
industry i know this because i used to

1249
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,800
work for avar

1250
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:07,440
this was this was our space we sold this

1251
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,440
kind of stuff

1252
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:12,560
but with all of that just making sense

1253
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:14,399
that noise and really prioritizing what

1254
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,759
you're going to use can be difficult

1255
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,160
and as your budgets are shrinking

1256
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:20,960
because of things like covid

1257
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:23,920
we need to be smarter now there was a

1258
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:25,839
really interesting study done by fireeye

1259
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,520
not that long ago and they found out

1260
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:31,839
some interesting

1261
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:31,839
things 60 plus

1262
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:38,640
60 plus tools in use

1263
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:40,079
on average in any enterprise environment

1264
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,839
of all the enterprise environments that

1265
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:44,960
they surveyed they found that

1266
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:48,000
on average each had at least

1267
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:50,960
60 tools in use or more

1268
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,440
think about that for a minute 60

1269
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,720
different

1270
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,720
technologies that we're trying to

1271
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:58,480
integrate together into some cohesive

1272
00:42:54,720 --> 00:43:01,598
strategy for securing our environment

1273
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:05,119
that's crazy that's a lot of work

1274
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:08,160
35 of those tools overlap

1275
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:09,760
meaning they do the same thing maybe

1276
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,480
in different ways maybe different parts

1277
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:14,560
of it we use them for different reasons

1278
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,640
and then not surprisingly eighty percent

1279
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,839
of those tools are underutilized as a

1280
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:20,560
result

1281
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:23,040
so we need to be smarter how can we use

1282
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:25,040
what we already have

1283
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,640
in new ways rather than just throwing

1284
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:28,720
another tool at it

1285
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:30,640
let's be smarter let's use the tools

1286
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:32,480
let's buy the right tools the tools that

1287
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:34,319
fit our environment don't go buy that

1288
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,920
big smoker when you can use the smaller

1289
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:37,440
one that's going to serve your needs for

1290
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,960
your family just fine

1291
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,200
do the same thing with your security

1292
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:43,119
tooling

1293
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,879
so bringing this all together to wrap

1294
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:47,040
this all up planning and preparation

1295
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:49,680
wins the day in barbecue

1296
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:51,920
you win executive sponsorship by driving

1297
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:54,799
business value

1298
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,280
can't rush your barbecue and you cannot

1299
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,920
rush

1300
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:59,599
your cyber security either you need to

1301
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,760
you can't secure it all tomorrow

1302
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:04,000
that's just the way it is just like you

1303
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:06,240
can't cook a brisket in an hour

1304
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,680
good smoke is essential dirty smoke ruin

1305
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:11,040
your barbecue the same way that if

1306
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:14,000
you can't measure your program

1307
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:15,279
effectively it's gonna fail

1308
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,640
there's no set it and forget it and

1309
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,880
barbecue even if you got one of those

1310
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,160
really cool traeger smokers

1311
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,280
you know what you still have to be

1312
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,040
paying attention you still got to be

1313
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,800
watching temperatures

1314
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:26,079
and you got to do the same you got to

1315
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,599
watch the temperature of the culture

1316
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:28,640
within your organization

1317
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,960
and make sure that you have

1318
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,759
accountability and enablement built into

1319
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,280
that

1320
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,119
and then finally know your tools and

1321
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,520
abilities and limitations and do the

1322
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:37,839
same

1323
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:40,160
with the tools that you have in your

1324
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:42,400
environment don't go chasing the fads

1325
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:44,640
use the tools you have when you can

1326
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,880
rather than going after something else

1327
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:48,000
you follow these rules you end up with a

1328
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:51,599
gorgeous brisket

1329
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,280
just like that check out that smoke ring

1330
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:54,960
that's what we want to see look at the

1331
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:58,160
juice pouring out of that

1332
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:00,079
that's a good brisket so as i wrap

1333
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:02,000
up just some things for you all things

1334
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:03,839
tasty first of all if you want recipes i

1335
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,680
got recipes lots and lots of them i

1336
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:06,960
tweet out all the time different foods

1337
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,799
i'm making including

1338
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,400
a dry rub recipe i saw someone

1339
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,040
celebrating in discord when i mentioned

1340
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,640
dry rub

1341
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:15,119
there's a dry rub recipe out there in my

1342
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:18,000
github go ahead and grab it

1343
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:20,480
