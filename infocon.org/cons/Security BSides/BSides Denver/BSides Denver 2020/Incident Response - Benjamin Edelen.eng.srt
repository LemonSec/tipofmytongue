7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,240
remember correctly

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,119

all right so

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,000
my name is benjamin edelen and i am the

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,440
chief information security officer

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,960
at the city of boulder and as a ciso

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,519
i am not a subject matter expert at any

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,280
topic because i have to do a whole lot

17
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,680
of different kinds of stuff

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,120
for uh a city which is an organization

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,800
that has a whole bunch of different

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,000
kinds of businesses going on at the same

21
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,919
time things like

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,360
airports and police departments and

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,879
public libraries

24
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,160
and rec centers and every one of those

25
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,480
types of businesses are deploying

26
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,440
technology very quickly

27
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,279
and so it's my responsibility to respond

28
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,479
to incidents that we have

29
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,560
in those technology areas and i i have

30
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,240
some folks who are helping me with that

31
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,320
but

32
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,520
one of the most powerful skills i've

33
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,439
found uh

34
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,960
in any domain is the ability to to

35
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,000
organize people

36
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,839
into a work effort that that uh stops

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,920
damage from happening and that restores

38
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,600
your organization to functionality and

39
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,520
during my time at the city i've been

40
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,720
through a variety of major incidents

41
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:33,199
um including major major fires uh

42
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,360
floods the floods of 2013 uh and this

43
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,880
pandemic response

44
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:41,759
and so i've learned by hanging out with

45
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,079
and watching our emergency management

46
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,680
folks in boulder has an office of

47
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,600
emergency management

48
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,960
over time i began to see that they had a

49
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,880
methodology that they used

50
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,479
for responding to what they call all

51
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,839
hazards incidents

52
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,039
so hazmat fire flood

53
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,360
and then in other parts of the country

54
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,479
they have things like hurricanes

55
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,920
and that methodology was it seemed

56
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,079
really cool to me but it didn't seem

57
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,239
super accessible for whatever reason

58
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,840
it was usually happening inside an

59
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,599
emergency operations center

60
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,120
there were big screens up on the tv all

61
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,840
kinds of people were working at the same

62
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,440
time

63
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,239
and you didn't get a lot of face time

64
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,480
with the emergency managers to kind of

65
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,879
pick their brain or understand

66
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,640
what was happening at their scale so

67
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,000
eventually i got into a position within

68
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,160
my organization where i could go

69
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,200
meet our head emergency manager and ask

70
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,079
for help and and

71
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,440
ask for some uh training about how this

72
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,239
works and actually the federal

73
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,760
government does

74
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,680
provide what's called ics training um

75
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,879
and that training would educate you

76
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,920
about sort of

77
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:46,160
this methodology but it doesn't uh

78
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,040
it isn't really immediately adapted to

79
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,200
cyber security

80
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,799
and i was interested in responding to

81
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,040
cyber security incidents on behalf of my

82
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,959
organization of all kinds

83
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,599
and i wanted that skill set so over time

84
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,519
i was able to learn this

85
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,040
the broad strokes of the ics methodology

86
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,319
and adapt them and

87
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,799
you'll have to forgive me as i go

88
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,640
through this presentation

89
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,920
because this isn't a perfect adaptation

90
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,760
of ics i

91
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,958
am a minimalist i like to cut out things

92
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,799
that are not working

93
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:17,440
or unnecessary in most situations

94
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,959
and so there are many elements of

95
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,680
incident handling that you will

96
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,680
need to inject back in if you especially

97
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,319
if you have a bigger incident

98
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,760
i think that it's important that cyber

99
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,440
security people realize that even though

100
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,560
we may be able to respond to a cyber

101
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,040
security incident

102
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,920
and gather a group of people and work a

103
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,798
problem

104
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,238
we are not good at things like figuring

105
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,840
out where people are going to sleep

106
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,040
or making sure that they stay the

107
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,879
appropriate distance from each other

108
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,440
while they're working through

109
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,399
an in-person work engagement during a

110
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,239
pandemic

111
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,440
or even just making sure that pizzas are

112
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,799
coming

113
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,480
everybody's getting fed everyone's

114
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,519
getting hydrated with safe to drink

115
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,439
water things like that

116
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,879
so incident handling people have that

117
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,079
stuff on lockdown

118
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,079
which is part of why i wanted their

119
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,599
skill set

120
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:06,480
so over time i developed this hybrid or

121
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:09,040
this this sort of variant on ics that is

122
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,518
specifically targeted for cyber security

123
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,319
and i've worked many incidents with it

124
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,519
and

125
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,159
one of the things that had me really

126
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,478
encouraged was a few years ago when the

127
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,759
state had an incident

128
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:22,719
at the colorado department of

129
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,320
transportation i know that ics was used

130
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,720
that a methodology similar to my own was

131
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,639
used to respond to that incident and

132
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,000
that actually allowed

133
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,520
and scaled all the way up to the

134
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,240
colorado national guard responding to

135
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,120
that incident

136
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,720
and that was a historic response to a

137
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,520
cyber security issue

138
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,360
and it gave me a lot of confidence that

139
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,639
my methodology was going to be

140
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:47,360
useful and scalable all the way up to

141
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,960
like truly mega sized response where a

142
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,560
military could even take over and

143
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:56,638
respond

144
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:58,880
in turn on behalf of my organization and

145
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,880
yeah i was going to say i did i have run

146
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,880
dozens and dozens of incidents

147
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,919
and the vast majority of those incidents

148
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,000
were not major

149
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,039
um there are you know very minor

150
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,039
incidents but

151
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,560
i do think this this gets to the heart

152
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,400
of uh

153
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,560
getting getting through those sands

154
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,840
phases of recovery

155
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,600
and capturing what you need to know

156
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,560
about your incident and it's it's kind

157
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,240
of elegant

158
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,240
and like any cool tool uh once you go

159
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,440
through an incident with me

160
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,039
you you just sort of learn what you need

161
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,479
to know to do it yourself

162
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,000
and i thought that was really neat i've

163
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,919
see i've gone through this incident with

164
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,880
this incident process with people before

165
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,280
and

166
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,000
they've been able to come out with the

167
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,359
ability to run

168
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,800
incidents themselves which i thought was

169
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,080
a really neat outcome and one that i

170
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,759
wanted to share with

171
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,520
besides denver and i've also used this

172
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,960
methodology in other parts of my life

173
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,599
so i will say that my my wife got breast

174
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,599
cancer

175
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,840
at about this time last year and i used

176
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,560
a very similar methodology to this

177
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,318
uh to help get her through her

178
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,600
chemotherapy and surgery so

179
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,600
this methodology can be used for a

180
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,960
variety of types of major incidents in

181
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,280
your personal life as well as

182
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,400
as in your professional life but the

183
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,799
goal here is that

184
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,400
i'm going to run through an incident and

185
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,840
if you kind of pay attention to the

186
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,400
tools and if you want copies of these

187
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,758
tools they'll be available at the end

188
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,080
you will have some tools that will let

189
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,080
you

190
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,000
jump in and kick off an incident in your

191
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,000
own organization and effectively manage

192
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,880
it through the entire incident

193
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,080
the tools are well enough designed that

194
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,240
just by putting these

195
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,318
up the incident begins to sort of

196
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,680
self-organize and handle itself

197
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,840
as long as you get some people assigned

198
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,199
into the roles which is pretty awesome

199
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,318
and you'll you'll see what i mean here

200
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,400
in a minute but i

201
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,600
i want everyone watching this to

202
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,840
envision

203
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,600
first of all this methodology came out

204
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,000
of conference room incident handling

205
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,880
it's not

206
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,240
an international tool um you know doug

207
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,759
brush could be here to tell us about

208
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,440
international incident handling

209
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,800
i tend to pull technical people into

210
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,000
conference rooms

211
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,160
and get the right people in there and

212
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,479
kick off an incident and so the first

213
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,479
phase once i know that something is an

214
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,359
incident the first thing that i do is i

215
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,240
go get those

216
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,919
giant white uh contact sheets that you

217
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,360
can stick up on the wall i get a big

218
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,240
sheet of those and i get a box of

219
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,319
markers

220
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,680
and that is the main tool that i use for

221
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,400
incident handling

222
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,080
i have a set of windows stickies here

223
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,039
which is nothing like my cool

224
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,719
uh sheets but imagine a conference room

225
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,880
any work conference room

226
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:32,160
you want to put those big contact sheets

227
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,919
up on the wall north south east and west

228
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,280
and every single person who walks into

229
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,639
that conference room can read

230
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:41,280
the contact sheets on each wall

231
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,400
and see where we at in this incident all

232
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,359
the information you need

233
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,638
is on this growing set of contact sheets

234
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,280
that are on the wall

235
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,360
and when i manage incidents over

236
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,799
microsoft teams for my organization i

237
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,400
use

238
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,400
mural which is an application that lets

239
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,919
multiple people

240
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:02,239
jump on and edit

241
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,520
the equivalent of those contact sheets

242
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,479
i'm going to share my screen here and

243
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,318
throw up mine

244
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,159
oh ho screen sharing is disabled by the

245
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,479
host all right i'll have to

246
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,840
ask that the host hooked me up with the

247
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,840
ability to share my screen

248
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:25,199
and i so i keep in in my mic

249
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:30,639
you should be good to go okay i keep

250
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,639
a template for these contact sheets

251
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:36,080
oh which one is ah okay

252
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,399
i keep these templates around because

253
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:42,000
they they

254
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,440
make this work so the first contact

255
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,560
sheet that i put up

256
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,399
is the instruction sheet

257
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,760
and i'm gonna open that up here and i'm

258
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,040
gonna stick it

259
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,959
and you're just gonna have to imagine

260
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,079
that i've i've grabbed a marker and i've

261
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:57,599
written this on a white

262
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,320
contact sheet or like i said a tool

263
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,959
where

264
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,760
the whole team is able to write on these

265
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:06,239
sheets

266
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,439
as well i'm going to throw these up

267
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,480
and then i'm going to explain what each

268
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,560
one of them is about and why

269
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,800
and how these work and then i'm going to

270
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:20,000
run through an incident

271
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,000
that is relatively real unfortunately

272
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,040
but the names have been changed to

273
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,040
protect the innocent

274
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,880
so imagine that you just got sucked into

275
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,920
a conference room

276
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:38,320
and there were there's four big white

277
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:41,360
sticky sheets on the wall

278
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,360
and these are what they say

279
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,040
the first sheet is the instructions for

280
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,880
how we handle incidents

281
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,800
and this list of instructions has grown

282
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,000
over time and it's it is important for

283
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,399
me and my process

284
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,839
that everybody take a moment to read the

285
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,760
instructions before they join an

286
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,120
incident handling team

287
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,120
so i'm sitting alone in a conference

288
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,320
room trying to kick off an incident

289
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:08,240
um and i'm writing this up here

290
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,760
and then obviously things are

291
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,040
confidential you know

292
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,120
obviously we don't want people speaking

293
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,319
at the same time but some of these down

294
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,680
here

295
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:20,079
came out of more unique experience

296
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,880
we will often find team members will be

297
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,479
hesitant

298
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,560
to add things to the worksheets on the

299
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,079
walls themselves it this

300
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,239
it is critical in this process that

301
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:32,079
people are comfortable participating and

302
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:35,680
and writing things up on the sheets

303
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:36,959
we we when communications

304
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,040
external communications are being

305
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,719
written a lot of times the chat is too

306
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,240
noisy um or the people talking are too

307
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,680
noisy and so it's okay to tell everyone

308
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,880
to quiet down and to stop side

309
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,239
conversations

310
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:50,399
um and then

311
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,360
you build out your team and write down

312
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,560
who they are you'll need this

313
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,680
information later so it's important to

314
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,079
write it down

315
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,399
i publish the links uh this is a new

316
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,839
addition to this for

317
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,440
when i'm managing these things online

318
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,480
because i think that

319
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,000
um sometimes people will want something

320
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,600
they can copy and paste to get back into

321
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,560
the chat quickly without having to look

322
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,680
for it

323
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,719
uh anyway let me kick off a demo

324
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,359
incident and

325
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,640
i will show you exactly how these

326
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,920
function i'm going to try to move my

327
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,720
little window out of the way so you can

328
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,839
see the other side

329
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,680
okay so imagine that i

330
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,440
am hanging out eating my lunch in my

331
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,719
office or at home

332
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,200
since we're all at home and i get a

333
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,000
phone call saying that

334
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,760
our senior system administrator has just

335
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,440
gotten a barrage of

336
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:40,160
file change warnings on a uh

337
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,480
like a windows file share and they're

338
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,519
super scary so

339
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:48,560
and suspecting a cryptoware attack

340
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:50,320
on those systems that cis had been shut

341
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,839
the servers down

342
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,040
just sort of proactively that was the

343
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,240
best thing he could think to do he

344
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,120
didn't want any more files to be

345
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,519
encrypted

346
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,399
and he shut the files down and now he's

347
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,399
worried that

348
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,079
he has a couple shutdown windows file

349
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,040
shares that might have been affected by

350
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,638
cryptoware

351
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,560
and he is worried that

352
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,240
um there may be cryptoware happening

353
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,599
elsewhere in the organization so he

354
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,880
calls his boss and says

355
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,560
this is what i think happened and these

356
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,519
are the actions that i've taken his boss

357
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,518
calls me

358
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:21,360
and i immediately kick off an incident

359
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,880
so the first thing that i do is i go

360
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,519
either go to a conference room or i

361
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,040
start a team

362
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,880
not necessarily a microsoft team but you

363
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,519
know some kind of team chat situation

364
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,279
and we pull

365
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:36,399
in some initial folks to be our

366
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:38,240
our initial response team

367
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,519
i put these contact sheets up on the

368
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,360
wall

369
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,880
and we build out the incident from the

370
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,800
contact sheets

371
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:48,000
so you know i get a resource manager

372
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,199
someone who can get me

373
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,240
sysadmins network planners um other

374
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,160
folks like that

375
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,120
i pull in a communications person

376
00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:00,480
someone who sends email on behalf of

377
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:03,519
our department and i pull in a scribe

378
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:06,000
so i grab you know maybe a service desk

379
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,279
member or someone from my team and i

380
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,800
asked them to

381
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,720
take notes on the incident as we go

382
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,880
along and to help me keep these contact

383
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,399
sheets up to date

384
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,160
i publish these contact sheets to the

385
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,040
team and in a way where they're able to

386
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,480
update where the

387
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,240
anyone on the team is able to update

388
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,440
them and then we

389
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:26,320
set meeting cadences so

390
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,079
um i typically tend to set one and a

391
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,639
half hour meeting cadences for serious

392
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,920
incidents

393
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,760
i think that gives us enough time to

394
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,639
work and then come back

395
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,519
with something something valuable and we

396
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,839
start to log

397
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,839
the incident that the team meetings and

398
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,639
we log when we send out our status

399
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,920
messages

400
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,360
uh the communications person is

401
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,160
responsible for writing up something

402
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,399
saying

403
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,079
what is down so here's the incident that

404
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,320
we have right now

405
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:52,239
first of all the information we have and

406
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,519
it i put timestamp here i think this is

407
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,120
important for meetings

408
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:59,519
but because um this is a demo incident

409
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:03,839
i'll just use the current time

410
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,839
8 17.

411
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,959
notification of

412
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,720
notification file changes let's say mass

413
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:18,720
notification

414
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,720
a file changes on file server zero one

415
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,639
and file server zero one shutdown

416
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:32,000
this is just so everybody knows

417
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,120
i love to break up information and

418
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,959
confirmed information

419
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:41,120
into two different pages because we hear

420
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:41,119
tons of rumors whoa that's weird

421
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,000
because i hear a ton of rumors during an

422
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,639
incident a lot of information comes in

423
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
that is

424
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,199
kind of garbage and i

425
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,800
ask that everybody update the

426
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,319
information section and then when

427
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,760
something is confirmed we move it down

428
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,240
to the confirmed section

429
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,880
so this has been confirmed by our

430
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,079
sysadmin

431
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,920
so i'm going to move it down into the

432
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:04,800
confirm section um

433
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,519
and i tend to put this information sheet

434
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,040
up

435
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:12,000
by a door that's near the that's nearest

436
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,040
to the service desk team and that lets

437
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,079
the service desk team

438
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,439
come in and write what what is down

439
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,359
and so now that the file servers are

440
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,760
down a service desk person might come in

441
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,639
and say

442
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,639
i think gis is down gis is like a

443
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:29,199
geospatial

444
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,199
platform

445
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,319
so now we're worried that gis is down we

446
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,240
don't know why the file servers are down

447
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,839
maybe it's a prerequisite

448
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,440
maybe the file server is a prerequisite

449
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,560
for the gis system

450
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,320
um and next up we need to start listing

451
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,880
the things that are down

452
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,880
so we know

453
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,519
file server zero one is down and that

454
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,850
serves the

455
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,999
a b

456
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:58,999
[Music]

457
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:07,519
and c drives so

458
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,639
if those drives are down department

459
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,079
drives or things like that

460
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,000
obviously those files are inaccessible

461
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:14,880
by the users and that is

462
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,880
a serious issue

463
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,399
and we begin now that we know what's

464
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:23,199
down and what are the

465
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,560
circumstances of this incident i begin

466
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:27,120
pulling people in and we start working

467
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,800
on the incident

468
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,320
so i pull in a resource manager and ask

469
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,479
for sysadmins

470
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,920
and we ask the systems to get to work

471
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,920
tasks like

472
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,160
um and i'm going to ignore time due here

473
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,160
um

474
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,519
i get a system named bill for example

475
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,880
and i start and i say bill i need you to

476
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,160
secure the backups this could be a

477
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,279
cryptoware incident

478
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:52,399
and the backups are lifeline

479
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,399
go secure the backups

480
00:16:53,120 --> 00:17:00,000
and i have another system named ted

481
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,279
and i say ted we need to take a look at

482
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,959
the cpu of

483
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,559
all of the systems in our environment

484
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,000
that are centrally managed and we need

485
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,720
to find

486
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,559
for example if there are systems that

487
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,480
have elevated cpu

488
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:15,199
maybe there's a way that we can detect

489
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:18,400
uh which systems are

490
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:21,839
which other systems are encrypting files

491
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,839
so ted is going to do that

492
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,480
and then jim

493
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:37,439
um let's have jim i had a good idea here

494
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,440
for jim

495
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,879
i'm just typically when you're running

496
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,159
in this you have a team of people coming

497
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,679
up with ideas right you've brought them

498
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,200
together they're all talking

499
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,240
in the context of these sheets that

500
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,320
you've put up um

501
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,880
and in a cryptoware incident you know

502
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,639
people very quickly move on to

503
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,160
what else could be wrong so we might

504
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,360
have jim take a look at the active

505
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,240
directory servers

506
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,360
and see if there's been abuse of our

507
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,320
users

508
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,320
or issues like that

509
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,159
and now there's a lull i've given some

510
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,039
assignments out we're probably getting

511
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,280
more information

512
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,720
from the service desk coming in about

513
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,480
which systems are down

514
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,799
who's frustrated that these drive

515
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,559
letters are no longer accessible

516
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,000
and we need to send something out to the

517
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:27,280
organization

518
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,679
saying folks were experiencing an issue

519
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,480
and the issue has resulted in this kind

520
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,720
of outage

521
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,559
and here's what you can expect from us

522
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,039
and so we send out a system status

523
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,240
message so our communications person

524
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,440
um and by the way i make these

525
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,240
assignments these are automatic

526
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,280
assignments

527
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,039
so i i bring in people

528
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,879
uh the communications person determines

529
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,280
the communication cadence and schedules

530
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,000
that

531
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,879
those communications and i schedule a

532
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,240
team meeting

533
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,080
and you send out actual meeting

534
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,679
appointments for these things

535
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,720
so our communications person sends out a

536
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,720
system status message

537
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,400
saying that drives a b and c are down we

538
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,400
apologize for the inconvenience

539
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,559
and we're working on this issue and you

540
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,120
can expect another communication from us

541
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:13,918
in one and a half hours at this time

542
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:16,719
which will be you know whatever um 10

543
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,720
o'clock basically

544
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,480
and i think it's important when you do

545
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,678
those communications that

546
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:28,400
you are fulfilling on your promises so

547
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,919
we i try to set an expectation with

548
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,559
communications people that we don't blow

549
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,160
it

550
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,480
just like i don't blow it when i do my

551
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,480
meeting

552
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,399
we have we make it happen we meet on

553
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,320
time

554
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,720
if people blow off the meeting to get

555
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:49,360
their tasks done that doesn't work

556
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:51,200
so now uh bill i'm gonna have to

557
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,559
i guess i'm not gonna look it up there

558
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,240
is

559
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,000
no good way to do no there is a good way

560
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,880
to do straight through bill gets back to

561
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,080
me and says

562
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,280
the backup servers are bulletproof they

563
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,320
are

564
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:06,399
hardened such that you need a specific

565
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,080
secure workstation to get on them those

566
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,080
workstations have not been accessed the

567
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,879
backup systems have not been accessed

568
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:15,760
they're off site there's nothing that's

569
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,880
going to get to our backups

570
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,039
and that's obviously something you have

571
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,720
to plan for ahead of time so

572
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,400
we're going to strike the backups off of

573
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,640
the system

574
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,840
or i mean off of the assignments list on

575
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,559
ted

576
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:31,600
he went out found no computers with a

577
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,600
high cpu load

578
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,039
and so we're going to mark that off as

579
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,440
well oh i'm sorry

580
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,320
i'm not going to do that yet jim goes to

581
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,640
a.d

582
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:44,158
and jim gets back something very strange

583
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,159
so jim comes back and says

584
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,840
why is that bold

585
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,000
tons of ad user activity and we

586
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,918
immediately jumped to the conclusion

587
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,600
that

588
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,320
perhaps a bunch of our ad users are

589
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,320
being affected

590
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:17,120
and i said no cpu but i'm going to go

591
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,320
with a little different tack here

592
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:22,559
so let's say we also find out from ted

593
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,559
that

594
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,559
we have elevated cpu on several desktops

595
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,840
and i'm going to mark ted's job off

596
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,840
because he did it

597
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:46,159
so now we're looking at a report from

598
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,919
active directory that shows a ton of

599
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,600
user activity

600
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,120
and i wish i could pull this report and

601
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,918
example this report up

602
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,879
um but it's showing almost every user in

603
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,280
the organization

604
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,640
has a bunch of file change activity

605
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:02,158
going on

606
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:05,840
and everybody within the incident team

607
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:07,360
is losing their minds it's really scary

608
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,199
to see that kind of thing because if

609
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,039
your a.d is

610
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,400
compromised you are toast as an

611
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,080
organization and even

612
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,080
the best incident handling crew is going

613
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,280
to struggle uh with a

614
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:22,960
with a pwned a.d to get something back

615
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:24,240
for your organization and that's where

616
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,320
something that i've learned over many

617
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,159
many many incidents comes into play

618
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,158
you really have to read those reports

619
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:33,600
carefully so we go back

620
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:35,360
and read through these reports and we do

621
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,918
not move things down into confirmed

622
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,719
information

623
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,600
until they're confirmed so i we tasked

624
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,000
somebody with

625
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:44,000
really looking at this elevated cpu and

626
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,280
really looking at this tons of ad user

627
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,880
activity

628
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,720
and what we find out and this is just a

629
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,320
demo incident

630
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,840
we find out that this report was run

631
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,799
really fast and somebody

632
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,639
pulled in way too broad of a scope so

633
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,320
maybe the last 10 days instead of the

634
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,559
last two hours

635
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,760
for this report and so of course almost

636
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:04,158
every user in the organization has

637
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,000
changed some files over the last 10 days

638
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,280
but almost no one has changed any files

639
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,960
over the last two hours so

640
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:14,080
this is this turns out to be

641
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,880
a false positive and i i can't stress

642
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,439
enough

643
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:22,159
that i have spent and wasted more time

644
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,880
in incidents running down false positive

645
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,240
stuff

646
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,600
by treating information as correct

647
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,080
and when you work an incident within

648
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,559
your own group you really really really

649
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,678
need

650
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:35,678
to be circumspect of false positive or

651
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,120
of the kinds of information that come in

652
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,000
because if they turn out to be a false

653
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,080
positive

654
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,760
you're going to waste a ton of time on

655
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,840
them i've spent more time working on

656
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,559
false positive stuff than i have

657
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,559
working on the actual real issues which

658
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,399
is ludicrous but it totally happens

659
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,918
this on the other hand is real we're

660
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,799
obviously worried about this

661
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,440
um and these elevated cpus we double

662
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,760
checked

663
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,880
a different way we jumped on one of them

664
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,840
and sure

665
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,480
sure enough uh this cpu is elevated

666
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,760
because

667
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:08,559
that system is crapping out binary files

668
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,360
and text files that contain ransom notes

669
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,600
so this thing

670
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,600
is true we're going to move it down to

671
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,760
the confirmed information

672
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,678
and maybe i should do this for this one

673
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,559
that's false we're going to strike it

674
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:23,120
we don't care that about the ad activity

675
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,120
so now

676
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:33,840
going back to bill

677
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,240
and remember this is i mean we'd have

678
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,200
hours and days to work through

679
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,520
uh identification and containment but

680
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,799
i'm

681
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,360
i'm just trying to get through the whole

682
00:24:54,799 --> 00:25:00,240
process of this incident for folks today

683
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:02,080
so you know keep in mind we're not going

684
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,960
to do root cause analysis here or

685
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,918
anything like that

686
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,600
um but just imagine in broad strokes if

687
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,320
you were running an incident

688
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,840
and you were being traumatized by um

689
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,200
having your file shares down having your

690
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,720
users be upset

691
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,640
uh you would you would be doing a whole

692
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,240
constellation of more different

693
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,159
team meetings and conversations and

694
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,760
things like that but we're we're moving

695
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,120
through this pretty fast just to get

696
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,960
just to get everybody a glimpse of the

697
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,719
process uh and

698
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,120
and why these four contact sheets are

699
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,120
essential

700
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:36,320
so we are now

701
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,240
we've tasked bill with getting a list of

702
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,720
pwn computers and ted

703
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:44,000
what we don't want to do is get the list

704
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:47,440
and sit on it in case it's spreading so

705
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,240
oh i'm sorry i s

706
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,080
sean move his webcam window to see sheet

707
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,320
four oh okay you guys can't see sheet

708
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,320
four

709
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,840
or did i do it

710
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,279
i'm not sure give me one uh tell me

711
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:11,760
what's up sean just the top right

712
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:16,720
what if i move this down is that better

713
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:20,320
this is fun i can't see my own stream so

714
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:23,200
okay perfect thank you okay

715
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,000
yeah sorry about that the um if if folks

716
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,679
weren't able to see this

717
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,520
these are this is my sort of template

718
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,720
assignments and then everything below

719
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,440
these are the assignments that i've been

720
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,919
making for

721
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:36,159
for people working the team okay

722
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,200
i didn't so bill's going to get the list

723
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:40,720
of phone computers

724
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,960
um whether it's by cpu or by doing

725
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,080
you know a powershell script that fi

726
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,840
searches for the

727
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,360
ransom notes or other things like that

728
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,320
ted's gonna start shutting down phone

729
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,879
computers

730
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:53,120
uh and we're gonna shut systems down

731
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,279
until we stop seeing this activity

732
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,799
and your you know if your mind goes

733
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:59,279
straight to well

734
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:00,080
other computers could be pwned but not

735
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,520
generating

736
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,439
you know cryptoware notices that's

737
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,400
absolutely true um i'm

738
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:08,159
i'm not saying that you'll have achieved

739
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,760
containment through this but it is just

740
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,799
for the purposes of this of working

741
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,320
through this

742
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:15,520
abbreviated engagement that we're doing

743
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,520
here today so

744
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,600
we assume for this engagement that as

745
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,520
ted works through shutting down all

746
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,600
these computers

747
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,960
we're going to be in good shape and we

748
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,600
know that our active directory is

749
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,279
probably safe

750
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,879
and so we want to start working on this

751
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,960
file server

752
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,240
and we sit down and we think about it do

753
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,480
we want to

754
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,799
bring it up without a network interface

755
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,200
maybe so we can see what's on it

756
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,399
do we want to just blow it away and

757
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,279
rebuild it

758
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:46,639
um what is the plan for this file server

759
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:49,600
so that we can get it back in the hands

760
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,039
of the users so ultimately

761
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,639
we decide that we want to rebuild it

762
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:55,760
from backups

763
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,039
i would say that you can get a little

764
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,559
ahead of yourself during incident

765
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:00,399
handling by trying to get into a

766
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:02,240
recovery phase before you're done with

767
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:04,239
the containment phase

768
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:07,200
but for the purposes of this you know

769
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,200
we're going to ask jim

770
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,720
to rebuild

771
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:17,840
fileserve01 from backups

772
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,200
bill starts to knock out the things that

773
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,720
are pwned

774
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:30,799
uh oh i'm gonna have to shrink this a

775
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:32,399
little bit

776
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:33,918
so we get word back from bill and ted

777
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,799
that they are done shutting down phone

778
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:37,039
computers

779
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:38,000
we want them to wait an hour you know

780
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:40,799
and make sure that no

781
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,559
new uh high cpu events happen or things

782
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:44,879
that we can use to detect those

783
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,840
uh crypto weird computers in the

784
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,880
meanwhile jim

785
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:58,480
is cranking out a new file share we send

786
00:28:48,880 --> 00:29:01,360
out another system status this is the

787
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,360
system status saying

788
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:06,000
we have the issue contained we really

789
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:08,719
appreciate your patience

790
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,080
uh shares a b and c are going to be back

791
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,840
available within

792
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,000
whatever time frame whatever we feel

793
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:16,158
like jim can get done with his rebuild

794
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:21,200
task

795
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:21,200
and so jim finishes up that rebuild

796
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:28,399
and fileserver01 returns to being online

797
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:31,039
and so we're going to strike it from the

798
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,039
down list

799
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,678
and then we're going to strike jim's

800
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,559
assignment we're going to send a final

801
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:45,600
system status saying

802
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:48,320
that we've restored so at this point

803
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:50,639
we were able to identify the incident

804
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:53,120
pull in people

805
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,200
create a process for working it together

806
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,199
as a team

807
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,960
pull in information confirm that

808
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,799
information to make the choices that we

809
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,919
need to make within the environment

810
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:05,600
track which systems were up and down

811
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:07,840
track what we all agreed we were going

812
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:11,439
to do to move through the incident

813
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:14,799
avoid false positives

814
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,840
and we sent out high quality user

815
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,639
communication throughout the whole

816
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,600
process

817
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,640
i submit that that is good enough for

818
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,600
incident handling if

819
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,600
you can run an incident like that you

820
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:28,158
are doing a good enough job

821
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:30,080
at facilitating knocking out a major

822
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,240
situation within your organization

823
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,918
and these are really scary you know when

824
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,720
you sit down and it's your systems that

825
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:38,159
are damaged these are really scary

826
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,279
so we finally are able to send the

827
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,279
system status now

828
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,000
final system status saying the issue is

829
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,799
contained and the file server the file

830
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,279
shares a b

831
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:52,158
and c have been restored to everybody's

832
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:55,360
pcs

833
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:58,960
and we hope you have a great day

834
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:00,320
there is uh one last step that i always

835
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,399
do in every single incident

836
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,559
which i leave on the contact sheet so

837
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:06,719
that i can remember to do it

838
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:07,840
which is to facilitate a detailed

839
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,000
incident debrief

840
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,120
and publish the lessons learned and the

841
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,679
fun part

842
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,199
about facilitating an incident debrief

843
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,600
if you've done this in a conference room

844
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,279
with

845
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,959
white contact sheets is that you can

846
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:20,240
pull the team of people that you listed

847
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,360
under team

848
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:33,840
back together oh i'm sorry

849
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:33,840
i should have done this

850
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,720
so i've got these guys listed i didn't

851
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:42,158
want to lose them

852
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,240
you can pull everyone back together and

853
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:46,240
you can relive the incident together

854
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,399
because you have the sheets and you have

855
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,559
the record of how things went down

856
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:52,479
so you can go through them by time stamp

857
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:54,480
and say this is what happened here

858
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,159
was everyone okay with how we handled it

859
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,919
was there too much table talk

860
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,360
and someone might come back and say yeah

861
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:00,720
my the communications person might have

862
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,639
said look everybody was talking at the

863
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,679
same time and it was really hard for me

864
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:07,279
to have the chance to write down uh the

865
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,880
system status message and get it out and

866
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:10,159
there were a ton of typos in it or

867
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,919
something because i was

868
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:13,360
i was i didn't have the environment that

869
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,600
i needed

870
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,719
and that gives an incident handler like

871
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,600
me

872
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,039
valuable information that i can use to

873
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:24,799
tune this process and

874
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:26,799
add more instructions or

875
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:29,840
manage the table talk better during the

876
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,840
incident or things like that

877
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,399
and i just want to draw everybody's

878
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,840
attention to some of the details of the

879
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:40,080
way these contact sheets

880
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:44,320
lay all of this really really plain

881
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,320
um so you can always

882
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,960
you if you are handling an incident for

883
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,799
long enough you have to go to bed

884
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,880
you absolutely have to say to another

885
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:54,240
human being i'm handing this off to you

886
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,039
and i need you to work it

887
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,600
and the cool thing about this process is

888
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:59,039
that

889
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,439
i even though i'm the only person who

890
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:04,240
really does incident handling work

891
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,880
within the organization anyone you hand

892
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,279
it off to

893
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,399
will be able to look at these sheets and

894
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:10,159
understand

895
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:11,600
what am i doing i'm asking these people

896
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:12,480
to get through these tasks that we've

897
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,918
assigned

898
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,360
i'm keeping up to date the list of

899
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:17,039
things that are down and the information

900
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:20,559
that comes in that's all we're asking

901
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:22,720
for the 12-hour shift that you're doing

902
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:24,399
you don't even have to be an expert at

903
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,080
you know the sans

904
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:28,080
phases or anything like that because

905
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,600
anything that doesn't get done

906
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,000
while you have assigned someone else to

907
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,840
be the the incident handler

908
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,919
you will see on the contact sheets isn't

909
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:38,240
done and when you get the incident back

910
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:40,320
you can finish out those items

911
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,240
so that's what makes this scalable is

912
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,760
that you can hand this incident off

913
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,600
for example you can call your cyber

914
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,360
security insurance company and if they

915
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,678
fly someone out to help you

916
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,039
they that person will recognize exactly

917
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,519
what's going on when they look at these

918
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:53,440
sheets

919
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:55,679
if you work for a city or a county and

920
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,480
you ask for an emergency manager to come

921
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,080
and help you

922
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,760
the emergency manager will look at this

923
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,120
and this will be very familiar to them

924
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,879
and they will know

925
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:05,039
exactly what's going on and that

926
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,360
emergency manager for you

927
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:08,560
or uh some that kind of professional

928
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,239
will be able to

929
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,000
coordinate where are people gonna sleep

930
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:13,598
how are you gonna get water because you

931
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,800
keep in mind this is this kind of

932
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:17,760
incident handling is

933
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,960
um doesn't do a great job the way it's

934
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,359
designed here

935
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,639
of getting people drinking water or a

936
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,319
place to sleep

937
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,839
and that is some those things come up

938
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,200
very very quickly if you're handling an

939
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:29,520
incident 24 7

940
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:30,399
for three days or for six weeks or for

941
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,399
something like that

942
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:34,078
um so you need to be prepared to scale

943
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:36,319
this up but it scales up

944
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,359
so easily as you grow the information

945
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,119
that you have available

946
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:40,399
you put more contact sheets on the wall

947
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,119
if the contact sheets are not

948
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:43,759
appropriate

949
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:45,839
you move it into an electronic format

950
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,879
but the fundamental structure behind it

951
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:48,639
no matter how

952
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:51,199
large the information set is no matter

953
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:53,520
how long the term of the engagement is

954
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:55,040
this is still that fundamental set of

955
00:34:53,520 --> 00:35:03,599
information that you have to have

956
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:06,960
to work that incident front to back

957
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:08,560
and so finally after

958
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,880
you've worked through the whole incident

959
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:14,000
and you've brought all your stuff back

960
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,000
oh man here's doug

961
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,560
finally after you worked through the

962
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:21,680
whole range of

963
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:25,599
issues um

964
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:27,040
you want to publish some kind of lessons

965
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:29,040
learned

966
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,560
and obviously when i say publish i don't

967
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,440
mean publish to the press or anything

968
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,279
like that

969
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,800
um although your communications person

970
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,640
should be able to

971
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,079
work together with a press liaison or

972
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,598
things like that if that's necessary

973
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,640
that's absolutely built into this

974
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:42,800
process

975
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,319
um and it's it can be very important to

976
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,839
manage the press if

977
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,839
depending on what kind of organization

978
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:49,920
you are

979
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:52,240
but what i mean is publishing some kind

980
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:56,079
of knowledge about the incident

981
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,879
and a basic a basic expectation that i

982
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:00,160
would have

983
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,960
for publishing information coming back

984
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,720
out of an incident

985
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,599
is way beyond just the nature of the

986
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,520
incident

987
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:08,880
you have to have a full root cause

988
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,320
analysis done

989
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,160
before you're done with the incident

990
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,720
before you're publishing you have to

991
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,879
know

992
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,240
what what hardening would have needed to

993
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,599
be done within your organization in

994
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,959
order to

995
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:20,960
prevent this kind of incident in the

996
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,560
future and you want to be able to say

997
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,079
that that hardening has been done

998
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,279
you don't want to just publish that it's

999
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,119
a good idea you want to say you were

1000
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,760
able to get it accomplished

1001
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:31,920
but most importantly for some of my

1002
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:35,520
purposes you want to be able to say the

1003
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:38,960
kinds of damage that the incident caused

1004
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:40,720
and so you want to keep track of how

1005
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:43,119
much money did you spend

1006
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,839
how much staff time did you spend how

1007
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:47,359
much

1008
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:48,320
um vendor time not necessarily their

1009
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:51,200
staff time but

1010
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,720
but um keep track of some some details

1011
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,439
about your vendors the the people that

1012
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,279
you

1013
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,040
worked with you know if you called mandy

1014
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:00,320
and tim to help you out with something

1015
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:02,000
or if microsoft's was uh engineers were

1016
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,119
on the phone with you for 30 hours you

1017
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,359
want to you want to keep track of some

1018
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:08,480
of those materials and details

1019
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:09,040
uh let's see okay time money reputation

1020
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,720
damage

1021
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,759
that's not quantifiable typically

1022
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,279
actually there's probably somebody out

1023
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,560
there who has a cool way to quantify

1024
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,079
reputation damage but

1025
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,839
i don't know how to quantify reputation

1026
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,640
damage um so that's a little bit of a

1027
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:21,279
qualified

1028
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:22,160
measurement but if you keep track of

1029
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,680
your incidents

1030
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:26,000
and you keep track of how much they cost

1031
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:28,078
you how much staff time they use and

1032
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,079
and what happened to the reputation of

1033
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:33,440
your organization as a result

1034
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:35,520
over time you can show the effectiveness

1035
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,720
of your cyber security program and of

1036
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:41,280
your incident handling

1037
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:43,200
techniques um because you're able to say

1038
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,680
at the end of the year here was how much

1039
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,680
we suffered um

1040
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,799
based on this kind of investment and so

1041
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,160
you can always tie that back to the

1042
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,119
investment that's being made in cyber

1043
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,640
security or

1044
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:54,560
back to suggestions that you have about

1045
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,920
how to do security well so if you're a

1046
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,359
security leader you want

1047
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,440
these metrics coming back out of your

1048
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,960
incident handling process and i assure

1049
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,520
you that if you don't collect them

1050
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,960
during

1051
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,200
the lessons learned phase they'll be

1052
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:07,040
lost and for

1053
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,359
city and county folks out there

1054
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,640
obviously you could be reimbursed for

1055
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,680
some of these things under certain

1056
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,160
circumstances

1057
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:16,000
if only by your cyber security insurance

1058
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,759
company

1059
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,760
but sometimes even at the federal level

1060
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,800
you can be reimbursed for these kinds of

1061
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:25,119
incidents

1062
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:28,320
um so that is an overview of

1063
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:31,520
of how this process works

1064
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:33,280
and i will say one more time that

1065
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,119
i have worked this process dozens and

1066
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:38,079
dozens and dozens of times i mean i

1067
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:39,920
i literally had one where it was like

1068
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:40,880
the doctors and from like i said i used

1069
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,560
this for my wife

1070
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,240
i had like all the doctor contact

1071
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,320
information under my team

1072
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,919
and i had the appointments that we were

1073
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,520
going to do um

1074
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,960
and i had the medications and their

1075
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,480
schedules and

1076
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,680
you know that process it was that

1077
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,640
modified process actually worked

1078
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,839
extremely well for

1079
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,839
for my family as well

1080
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:04,000
so i will make these templates available

1081
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:07,200
to anybody who's interested in them

1082
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,400
and i do have a few other fun incident

1083
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,040
handling

1084
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,760
uh materials that i will make available

1085
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,240
um

1086
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,839
but i will say that there are people

1087
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,560
like doug brush who have traveled all

1088
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:18,160
over the world

1089
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,000
you know who've been dropped into unique

1090
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,879
places and situations and worked

1091
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,760
incidents

1092
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,119
uh with nothing except like a dull spoon

1093
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,400
i mean some of those people can tell you

1094
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:27,680
more about

1095
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,680
some things you may need to know if

1096
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:31,200
you're interested in pursuing a career

1097
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,359
as an incident handler

1098
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,799
um for example you really may need to

1099
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:37,680
know

1100
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,480
where like how to pack a kit or things

1101
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,799
like that

1102
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,240
there may be critical things that you

1103
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,599
need to have in a backpack if you're

1104
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,160
gonna like go somewhere and work an

1105
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:46,160
incident

1106
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,839
and i'm not an expert at that i am a

1107
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:50,000
defensive security person so i work

1108
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:51,119
incidents at my own organization for my

1109
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,640
own organization

1110
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:54,480
usually the team of people i'm working

1111
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,160
with is my people or people we've

1112
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,839
brought in as vendors

1113
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,680
so keep in mind that you'll have to

1114
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:01,759
heavily modify this process if you want

1115
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,759
to use it

1116
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,520
at your next engagement in a foreign

1117
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,000
country or things like that but

1118
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,520
i think no matter where you go you may

1119
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
well have

1120
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:14,480
uh you may well find that these

1121
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,640
materials are perfectly adequate for

1122
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,680
working through almost any kind of

1123
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,200
incident

1124
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:21,040
or disaster that crops up within your

1125
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,040
environment

1126
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,720
so i'm gonna stop sharing i will get

1127
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:28,800
those materials put together

1128
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:28,799
and i am done

1129
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:40,319
thank you very much benjamin that was

1130
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:43,279
that was fantastic um

1131
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:43,920
admittedly i was listening to it on

1132
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:48,240
three different

1133
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:51,520
audio streams slightly different offsets

1134
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:53,520
but it sounded really interesting um

1135
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:55,040
so if you want to move over to the

1136
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:58,000
discord

1137
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:59,599
i shall um and you can do i believe

1138
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,920
there are ways to do voice

1139
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:03,440
and video in there if you want to but if

1140
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,800
you just want to do text that's fine as

1141
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,640
well

1142
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,480
all right thank you very much for your

1143
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,240
time everybody have a great day

1144
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,839
thank you for volunteering to contribute

1145
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,680
today it was that

1146
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:15,680
means a lot to have i mean especially

1147
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:18,480
you know we're besides denver

1148
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,359
uh you're you know a brother city just

1149
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,720
up the road

1150
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:22,720
considered part of the denver metro

1151
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,319
front range more or less as much as

1152
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,040
boulder doesn't like to admit that

1153
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:27,680
sometimes

1154
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:29,279
oh we totally are and i will say this

1155
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,680
our cyber security community that we

1156
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,119
have

1157
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,440
along the whole corridor of the front

1158
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,800
range is very tight

1159
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,599
through groups like colorado equals

1160
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,680
security and and this b-sides group

1161
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:40,640
you know it is um it's a huge honor to

1162
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,078
be a part of the

1163
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,759
all of the different people working

1164
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:44,640
shoulder to shoulder against the

1165
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,319
adversaries

1166
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,520
um to protect the front range and i do

1167
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:48,880
think we have one of the strongest cyber

1168
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,079
security communities in the world for

1169
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,880
that reason

1170
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:54,079
that's that's really good to hear um

1171
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,160
i've actually been

1172
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:57,760
involved in the community for a while

1173
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:00,078
and i can remember a time where

1174
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,280
um there was a there was there was and

1175
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:05,040
is a group called

1176
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,920
the 303 it's mostly just a a drinking

1177
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,880
group with a

1178
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:10,319
hacker problem um and there was i would

1179
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,440
run into people

1180
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:15,680
like defcon for instance um

1181
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,560
who would who were you know full on full

1182
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,480
into security

1183
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,560
very knowledgeable very smart very you

1184
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,079

1185
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,279
social people

1186
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:25,280
who would say oh yeah we've heard of

1187
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:29,280
three or three we don't like those guys

1188
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:32,319
i would never hear from them again um

1189
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:34,400
so it's improved a lot over the years

1190
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:35,759

1191

1193
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,599
great leadership

1194
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,720
um from the state level and cyber

1195
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:44,480
security uh

1196
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:46,078
brings a lot of diversity together into

1197
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,000
our area and then

1198
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:49,920
colorado equal security is unmatched in

1199
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,560
my opinion around major metropolitan

1200
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,480
areas

1201
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:54,799
for bringing our cyber security leaders

1202
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:57,119
and talent together to share

1203
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,000
all kinds of things so i'm proud to be

1204
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,280
