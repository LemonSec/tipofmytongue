[Music]

5
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:43,760
do that

6
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:19,440
someone is recounting you network plots

7
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,090
okay what if it's a non-touch recon what

8
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,470
if we're finding out all three email

9
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,769
addresses from third parties that's

10
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:37,609
great for the internet which is legal

11
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:37,609
very legal link in Nicholas Creek

12
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:49,500
inside a basement not very effective so

13
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:51,560
we do it we get every time one of you is

14
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,519
going to post a link to our blog post

15
00:03:51,560 --> 00:04:20,430
we're going to get an email that says

16
00:03:53,519 --> 00:04:22,620
someone within their organizations blow

17
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:24,690
us up for our engagement even otherway

18
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:28,050
because we go by so many try to install

19
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:30,360
CMS on it and then get it categorized so

20
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:33,320
that when we go to fish you your content

21
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,320
filtering cousin

[Music]

24
00:05:24,349 --> 00:05:31,050
you're right all right so when it works

25
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:33,330
is we go through an actual pen test here

26
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:35,039
the items that are how they deliver and

27
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:45,779
the process what we found the process

28
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:48,300
and what we know you could be anywhere

29
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:50,779
in this see something shiny to jump to

30
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,779
an explanation

31
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:56,340
I have lots of tools areas for recon the

32
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:59,210
idea here is that after we did a recon

33
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:13,770
for a fictitious company we found the

34
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:17,758
farming with some crazy young worth

35
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:21,359
there you're right what we found so far

36
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,969
and some users and services okay so what

37
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:27,030
is this up right we're just gonna here

38
00:06:22,969 --> 00:06:29,639
and these things on your perimeter then

39
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:33,719
we're gonna try to exploit it so much

40
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:36,569
it's always yeah oh we gonna do it okay

41
00:06:33,719 --> 00:06:40,020
so we have user accounts you guys no

42
00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:41,370
more jealous yes the spring told you to

43
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:45,150
something you wrote a long time ago when

44
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:47,930
he was tired of something that any of

45
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,929
you used male sniper

46
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:52,090
okay you got it wrong

47
00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:00,500
and then the strange toolkits to atomize

48
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:11,150
an old sniper Brad sis erupts we're

49
00:07:09,259 --> 00:07:13,849
gonna show those Bulldog here in just a

50
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:16,460
second one of them interacts with

51
00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:20,810
credential validation and actually

52
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:25,400
touches your DC for 771 and then the

53
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:27,349
other one does credential something

54
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,090
different than its event ID four seven

55
00:07:27,349 --> 00:07:31,610
seven six so they interact a little bit

56
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:44,719
differently with your networks but do

57
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:46,490
the same using that information along

58
00:07:44,719 --> 00:07:50,860
really good in past experience you have

59
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:50,860
a world which is not difficult

60
00:07:55,530 --> 00:08:05,099
right it's on I saw something trifling

61
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,090
all right so the point years that we're

62
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:18,450
able to spray is taking this long so if

63
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:19,950
you notice my cell addresses so that

64
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:22,110
mouse title right we see the threads

65
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:24,210
running across here and this interacts

66
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:26,040
with an exchange box that tells the

67
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:27,390
exchange box can you go check each one

68
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,680
of these individual accounts against the

69
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:30,630
domain controller and tell them their

70
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,400
valid these tools take about

71
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:46,740
approximately the same amount of time to

72
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:48,329
do the same so I Killian logs between

73
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:50,850
look for is a bunch of fail

74
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:52,200
authentication tennis happening from one

75
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:54,720
place and in this case the application

76
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,920
is enticing to coming from exchange so

77
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,920
which changed to your DC

78
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:12,559
minimal times

79
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:12,559
[Music]

80
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:28,610
[Music]

81
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:45,130
so anyway with both of these tools we

82
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,870
password spread we gain access to

83
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:48,640
credentials they operate a little

84
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:51,010
differently when all of these should

85
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:54,520
trip things on your network you should

86
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:57,340
catch us doing this this is a fantastic

87
00:09:54,520 --> 00:10:02,319
place where blue cheesy to say we caught

88
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:03,610
you down red blue to perspective we

89
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,350
should be able to see a pastor sprayer

90
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:10,720
and with that passing fingers you have

91
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:15,000
bones available off your gun was

92
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,000
successful as soon as you see a bunch of

93
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:43,110
this is not on by default and you would

94
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,110
not believe

95
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:53,640
oh good okay perfect okay that's really

96
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:55,230
good

97
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,210
and then everybody familiar with not

98
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:59,330
against this one and actually using it

99
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:59,330
effectively

100
00:11:05,689 --> 00:11:14,389
so we want to see

101
00:12:05,260 --> 00:13:16,540
we what's inside was interesting emails

102
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:48,770
[Music]

103
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,289
[Music]

104
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:33,270
so one weekend now and we've got access

105
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:36,800
to a vessel like this one down mandibles

106
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:39,120
and tell what you find on extras and

107
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,240
there's no direct way to get where

108
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,240
you're going

109
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:50,190

110
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,929

00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:48,169
[Music]

114
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:12,759
what we do is internal access with

115
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:15,249
additional that's what your networks

116
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:17,999
looting or scanning probably moving

117
00:16:15,249 --> 00:16:17,999
toward purple team

118
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:36,189
[Music]

119
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:31,590
okay okay yes use our powers

120
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:28,809
[Music]

121
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:36,290
[Laughter]

122
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:49,610
yeah with extent we've seen almost do

123
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:50,930
with it with that password that the

124
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:54,100
interns changed and then emailed the

125
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:54,100
Playtex to other interns

126
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,879
[Music]

127
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:58,109
[Music]

128
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,649
[Music]

129
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:24,420
so here we go right we have the user who

130
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:26,040
requests the system name on the network

131
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:28,650
that is not resolved by your DNS

132
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:37,920
infrastructure windows behavior isn't

133
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:42,440
that right sure yeah that's me

134
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:47,340
we relay the poison response to our part

135
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:48,600
ok doesn't work multicast the save

136
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:53,250
request

137
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:56,918
yeah that's me right here and we said

138
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:59,860
that poison responds to our target s of

139
00:20:56,919 --> 00:21:07,630
these systems let me recap that so I

140
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:09,280
opened up holders windows when I take

141
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:11,860
the interns here which is not a real

142
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,240
stare windows say yeah that server

143
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:26,860
doesn't exist I don't really know what

144
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:30,850
to do anybody on the letter - no - give

145
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:32,830
me to send you files on Windows so you

146
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:34,809
send me your apps on Windows and I'll

147
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:37,030
first you and then I'll give you

148
00:21:34,809 --> 00:21:43,059
something that I don't have okay and

149
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:44,408
then the attackee server gave nothing

150
00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:46,928
returned because it really didn't care

151
00:21:44,409 --> 00:21:48,520
all the one was your house and next part

152
00:21:46,929 --> 00:21:52,440
of that is this gonna take the hash it's

153
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:52,440
going to use it that's gonna get support

154
00:21:52,669 --> 00:21:57,529
whereas you but all it has is my hatched

155
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:59,509
I did give it them password

156
00:21:57,529 --> 00:22:02,330
speaking of hash does anyone recognize

157
00:21:59,509 --> 00:22:08,720
that one I have one hash highlight does

158
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:21,619
anybody recognize this this is a blank

159
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:23,359
LM hash there is no Landman force the

160
00:22:21,619 --> 00:22:25,609
password policy greater than 14

161
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:27,080
characters not 14 characters because

162
00:22:25,609 --> 00:22:30,859
Windows with chalk let it happen

163
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:32,689
windows will shock that thank you if

164
00:22:30,859 --> 00:22:35,570
your password policy is 14 characters

165
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:37,549
it's not good enough windows will take a

166
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:39,559
14 character password chop it in half

167
00:22:37,549 --> 00:22:42,129
and store two chunks of hash which we

168
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:45,739
can crack my holding space time in our

169
00:22:42,129 --> 00:22:49,248
GPU it's worse than that okay they bring

170
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:51,649
the white land man is so so bad okay

171
00:22:49,249 --> 00:22:53,299
14 character password yeah that's a good

172
00:22:51,649 --> 00:22:54,738
that's a great okay now we're gonna cut

173
00:22:53,299 --> 00:22:57,168
it out we're gonna send into two

174
00:22:54,739 --> 00:22:58,850
different seven character passwords but

175
00:22:57,169 --> 00:23:01,850
before we do that we're first going to

176
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:04,299
make everything capitalized so we have

177
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:06,889
like what maybe 15 to its characters and

178
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:10,158
then we won't have to crack seven of

179
00:23:06,889 --> 00:23:11,299
those at a time that takes the entire 14

180
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,429
characters basically and that takes

181
00:23:11,299 --> 00:23:16,570
about two minutes so if you store

182
00:23:13,429 --> 00:23:16,570
anything in man

183
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:28,429
on your domains and then everyone

184
00:23:25,289 --> 00:23:28,429
changed their password

185
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:44,570
because the alignment attribute enacted

186
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:44,570
rhetoric and only store 14 characters

187
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,919
[Music]

188
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:59,880
la-di-da

189
00:23:54,350 --> 00:24:02,730
that's the DNC line - that's right so we

190
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:04,020
always have a request for a user target

191
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:12,360
in the system with us would be signing

192
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:15,500
disabled so the idea is here we let you

193
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:18,059
get local admin because I'm a typo

194
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:21,350
because an intern takes an interest here

195
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:21,350
instead of interns centered

196
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:43,270
[Music]

197
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:43,270
countless wasting on your network oh

198
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:50,030
that's awesome okay so everything we

199
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:51,219
just did there your every sponder

200
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:54,139
respond are someone that's gonna say

201
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:56,299
window says hey is mouth certain they

202
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:58,340
have it and respondents we say hey

203
00:24:56,299 --> 00:25:00,320
that's me and it's we're descent and

204
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:01,850
chillin real answers take that pass and

205
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,649
then use it to a thank you on that same

206
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:04,100
system to the track together just one

207
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:06,080
condition

208
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,549
note that targets is a variable so

209
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:11,320
definitely try it on that one system

210
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:11,320
we'll try it all the targets

211
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:32,519
[Applause]

212
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:48,180
okay it's not five minutes of 24 minutes

213
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:50,010
we're 24 minutes into a pendant okay

214
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:53,670
prepare every Constance actually took us

215
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:54,870
like 20 minutes before so we're 44

216
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:56,520
minutes into the pen test we have a

217
00:25:54,870 --> 00:26:01,110
local admin and one of your internal

218
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:10,889
desktops the time there's not that

219
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:13,110
accurate the question is can your blue

220
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:15,240
team find all those connections and

221
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:22,290
block us within another time

222
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:24,740
what's the average response time yeah

223
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:27,930
it's more than two hours I hear too well

224
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:30,120
but usually we're in two hours really

225
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:31,680
awesome looting a really awesome sim

226
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,389
that's finding everything and automating

227
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,130
for you and then taking every resource

228
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:36,630
and walking on the floor

229
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:38,780
automatically without disrupting

230
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:38,780
business

231
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:58,170
this hurt my trouble before yes

232
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:21,240
yeah he's annoying lives in Denver area

233
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:21,240
we call them London services there

234
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:08,550
probably we've done account that has

235
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:08,550
local admin on leveraging the domains

236
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:16,360
alright so right now we're gonna be

237
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:18,640
retro and yellow right so we've got 259

238
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:21,399
ounce now we know where the owh server

239
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,470
isn't over the VPN server this you have

240
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:25,090
a valid credentials and additional

241
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:27,610
credentials in this room we know what

242
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:28,929
the internal network access landscape we

243
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:31,020
know the identified services the river

244
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:34,480
to a mind which is SMB which we've used

245
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:35,860
with responder investment be signing zip

246
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,080
which has allowed us to take those

247
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:39,520
batches to replay them over and over we

248
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,169
have the internal callosum which we

249
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,060
found this I have an email we have a

250
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:46,180
political as somebody which is given a

251
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:47,860
sign disabled and we found even happens

252
00:28:46,180 --> 00:29:01,060
we just used here which gave us

253
00:28:47,860 --> 00:29:03,929
additional lashes and I think we think

254
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:03,929
we missed in the screen

255
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:12,729
[Music]

256
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:25,450
this one this is going to tell us that

257
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:27,789
something touched L says what touched L

258
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:32,320
sets in here why pick you cell says

259
00:29:27,789 --> 00:29:33,940
what's it L says Chris made me catch my

260
00:29:32,320 --> 00:30:03,340
billfold plaintext creds on the memory

261
00:29:33,940 --> 00:30:05,230
with those it's really hard to trigger

262
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:10,209
on that it was even harder for us to

263
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:12,039
sort out which ones so it's hard but

264
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:15,370
this one is amazing

265
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:18,220
okay time to learn how to walk properly

266
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:19,330
we install to spawn there there's

267
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:21,909
another problem with us and actually

268
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:24,010
identifying what we've done because he's

269
00:30:21,909 --> 00:30:26,200
tell some hackers to go build a network

270
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:28,269
that's contrived and does a bunch of

271
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,679
automated things the way that hackers

272
00:30:28,269 --> 00:30:31,840
are going to automate all the things

273
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:33,309
that make it look like user accounts are

274
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,149
to essentially installed malware

275
00:30:33,309 --> 00:30:37,539
everywhere

276
00:30:34,149 --> 00:30:38,709
so he's then trying to go back and find

277
00:30:37,539 --> 00:30:41,379
where you're running malware

278
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:42,880
intentionally inside of all the other

279
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:45,010
intentional malware that's going to be

280
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,419
really difficult so if you're actually

281
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:48,220
looking at blue tier perspective on

282
00:30:46,419 --> 00:30:50,260
Active Directory domain it just looks

283
00:30:48,220 --> 00:31:02,139
like Matt what everywhere and all that

284
00:30:50,260 --> 00:31:04,510
malware is to automate user behavior so

285
00:31:02,139 --> 00:31:07,750
all the other project this entire Latin

286
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:08,710
we built Asafa is tapped in multiple

287
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:10,720
network connections

288
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:14,429
so the governor teams that do blue team

289
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,429
do they tried to do hunt team analysis

290
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:42,240
fishing who loves fishing anyone to SBI

291
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:49,770
security okay

292
00:31:56,270 --> 00:32:04,200
[Music]

293
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:13,220
coefficient is the rebuilt and

294
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:17,000
sub-regional but if they're trying to

295
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:19,010
mimic with me here someone know before

296
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,790
so if using no before it's similar to

297
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:35,750
that except it gives you a metric so

298
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:39,250
tell you how many interviews is why her

299
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:39,250
company you search the news

okay so we're going to fish someone you

304
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:07,900
really really want them to click on the

305
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:10,719
link you really don't care about the

306
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:14,550
consequences you can send an email from

307
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:19,600
each arm that says hey there has been a

308
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:55,330
complaint of nature and you need to

309
00:34:19,600 --> 00:35:01,470
review this document if you start

310
00:34:55,330 --> 00:35:05,020
talking about finances so organic

311
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:08,890
something you say hey guys bakery we're

312
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:11,440
in a position to acquire southern farm

313
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:14,680
district now check out these plants

314
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,960
which think and then you actually

315
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:20,680
include like the price of the farm and

316
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:23,530
maybe the value of the bakery system the

317
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:25,060
process people you know they shouldn't

318
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:26,320
probably be privy to that information

319
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:29,049
with you're going to click on it because

320
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,790
they're interesting another one we

321
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:40,120
didn't like the fishing in terms of

322
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:44,890
email Google Calendar injections yeah

323
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:47,290
that's scary ever you can send your CEO

324
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:49,690
orbit rarely keep pop-up this is a happy

325
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:53,700
at this meeting in 20 minutes

326
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:53,700
and the agenda is rakers put them

327
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:27,320
and Google Calendar in Texas is an

328
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:29,870
active feature so ball strike is awesome

329
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:34,120
okay see to infrastructure so it's a

330
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:34,120
kind of mess interpreter

331
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:47,270
Oh No so continue

332
00:36:48,590 --> 00:37:02,150
a lot of documentation because

333
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:04,730
generating cues about 40 pages of

334
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:08,580
technical training which is not fun to

335
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:10,030
do after the faculty yeah that's bad

[Music]

341
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:11,390
you should say what the motor 41 what

342
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:14,800
6.1 why it matters how to make it better

343
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:14,799
in terms

344
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:25,819
get a better index position a

345
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:27,530
practitioner level methodology which

346
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:29,240
means you take that report you need go

347
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:31,820
step by step you can reproduce

348
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:33,560
everything that the pen tester did the

349
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:35,840
exact same way and come to the exact

350
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:38,240
same results the reason that's important

351
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:39,920
is after your team faces vulnerabilities

352
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:42,350
you want to be able to retest that

353
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:45,580
methodology without going to another pen

354
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:45,580
tester for you

358
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:09,370
so yeah kind of lessons about fishing

359
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:11,950
yes so we get it domain you purchased a

360
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:12,549
domain we want that's a way to be look

361
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:14,950
legitimate

362
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:17,470
so if you have the Borden ended with

363
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:19,600
Cisco when you go to the web browser and

364
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:23,859
you open up with the targets that domain

365
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:25,690
typically good having good product that

366
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:26,950
filters then it's I should wear to check

367
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:28,810
in this database to see whether or not

368
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:31,569
that domain name this accurate

369
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:32,860
legitimate miscategorized and it's gonna

370
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:34,960
say oh yeah that's categorize to the

371
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:36,310
business sector so it's probably Jimin

372
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,290
for that user to get to it

373
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:40,740
in order for that fish to work we have

374
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:40,740
to go in

375
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,250
[Music]

376
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:09,940
everybody knew what it is marketers oh

377
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:12,850
what happens okay so SPF 30 can the idea

378
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:14,440
is that if I send you an email SPF is

379
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:16,509
what you tell receive email server

380
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:18,850
whether or not my email that I sent was

381
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:20,740
authorized to be sent with the front

382
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:22,930
domain that I'm setting it has these

383
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:24,430
together can tell recipient mail servers

384
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:27,640
they were not authorized to send an

385
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:29,980
email with dk when I sent my email I

386
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:32,020
then have to include a key and that key

387
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:35,140
is the public key that I'm sending has

388
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:36,730
to match the key that's in DNS so that

389
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:38,980
is one way to authenticate email it's

390
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:40,600
being sent with d-minor utilize these

391
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:42,700
two things together and you can build a

392
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:44,710
report back so the bleep blue teamers

393
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:46,390
perspective you can use a team on here's

394
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:48,850
what a bit like about this you can use

395
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:51,730
team up to determine all the emails that

396
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:53,710
are sent using your from domain that are

397
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:56,170
not sent by someone you authorized to be

398
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:59,350
sending email from right so China is

399
00:41:56,170 --> 00:42:02,440
sending sorry if any one else that is

400
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:04,660
not use sends email on your behalf you

401
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:07,060
will get a report back from recipient

402
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:08,868
mail server saying hey when you receive

403
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:10,160
this mail we actually walked it

404
00:42:08,869 --> 00:42:12,890
know that that's what democracy

405
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:14,450
recording okay so it's pretty important

406
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:16,220
there's also really great 12 dozen

407
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:17,990
Houston mark on its own here it gets

408
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:20,450
really ugly email reports back that are

409
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:21,558
useless they're like what's a great data

410
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:31,910
and stuff that doesn't make any sense

411
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:34,839
that anyone what you want to do is so

412
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:34,839
partner agencies

413
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:57,230
the marketing agency should be working

414
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,790
with the IT department the way they

415
00:42:57,230 --> 00:43:00,470
don't but let's see what they don't

416
00:42:58,790 --> 00:43:01,779
anyways if they did you come to get

417
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:06,680
better penetration where it's on emails

418
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:09,470
alright I think we were any other

419
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:18,100
questions yes how's the food the

420
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:18,100
increased move to reduce your ability

421
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:28,040
through this we ran the HTML was inside

422
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:30,110
of the fish if we sent that 12 is 365 we

423
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:32,360
will get an immediate beacon back to our

424
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:35,060
c2 sir that does not come from our

425
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:36,740
client no it came from yes it comes from

426
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:40,900
office 365 they're inspecting that

427
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:40,899
traffic they will recognize it as a c2

428
00:43:52,359 --> 00:43:56,000
so you have to be clever you have to

429
00:43:54,350 --> 00:44:00,069
make emails that look legitimate and

430
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,070
doubly directly to your Bimmer

435
00:46:10,829 --> 00:46:16,480
that is very very quiet very targeted so

436
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:19,720
if you'll notice before we did it pass

437
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:21,280
the spray no you don't do that we will

438
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:24,009
do everything we tend to find what we

439
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:25,500
know anyone a lot password to one valid

440
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:30,369
user account and that's one of the use

441
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:34,150
the same username so if not to raise any

442
00:46:30,369 --> 00:46:36,780
suspicions it's much slimmer Intel had a

443
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:36,780
really cool
