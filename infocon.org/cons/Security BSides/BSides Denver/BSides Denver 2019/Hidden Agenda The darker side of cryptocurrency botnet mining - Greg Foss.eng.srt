1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,170
is going to talk about cryptocurrency

2
00:00:01,879 --> 00:00:06,298
botnets and all these other neat buzz

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,410
words into here and actually make some

4
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:10,170
sense out of it where he's going to

5
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:12,000
pretend to be one of the other will see

6
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:22,490
them for 30 minutes and then you can

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:26,079
peplum all right all right

8
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:29,929
you get her test drink right now

9
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:32,000
all right cut a few so I just want to

10
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:34,100
give value a cheers - who out to be

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,160
security and Joe for letting us crash

12
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:42,799
their office for the day thank you guys

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,799
[Applause]

14
00:00:45,339 --> 00:00:52,519
so today I wanna talk to you guys about

15
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:55,730
is this botnet campaign that we've been

16
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:57,140
tracking probe antenna what kind of made

17
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:59,599
this turned into something actually

18
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:06,500
interesting I think was worth at least

19
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:08,960
putting some slides together um trim

20
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:11,360
like polish it out because I have 30

21
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,800
minutes so I will see if we even have

22
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,130
time for questions but I'll be around

23
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:17,420
later there's some stuff like ways that

24
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:20,380
we acquired some of this information

25
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:24,490
that we have to talk about offline so

26
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:28,070
we'll see when we get to Q at any time

27
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:29,869
what so uh introduce myself my name is a

28
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:31,908
great class and my principal threat

29
00:01:29,869 --> 00:01:33,649
researcher with the carbon black part of

30
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:35,990
the threat analysis unit you need a lot

31
00:01:33,649 --> 00:01:38,479
of traffic the botnets we build off the

32
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:41,030
queries that you see within the whole

33
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:45,100
not be a whole part black product line a

34
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:49,130
lot of attacks a duration as well so

35
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:51,919
anyone in here here the know that small

36
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:54,500
memory it's kind of benares when an old

37
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,030
esoteric it's not too much to present in

38
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,360
the United

39
00:01:55,030 --> 00:02:00,670
it's kind of predominantly Russia

40
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,409
attacked and a burial so but it is now

41
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:04,960
branch nearly two states so now we're

42
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:06,640
actually seeing a lot more of it here so

43
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,220
a smaller girl is kind of interesting

44
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,750
right this is not a new mod minute by

45
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:17,380
any means this is one that kind of came

46
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:21,400
out in late 2016 mid 2017 you know since

47
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:23,380
that time frame there's just a new right

48
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,150
up we just came out I want to say about

49
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:27,359
we could go by how to tread my credible

50
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:30,790
they felt something neither Oh

51
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,830
predominantly what this is is a crypto

52
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:35,350
writing botnet you're just running XM

53
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:39,040
rig and mining cryptocurrency on

54
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:41,560
compromised Windows systems so what's

55
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,000
interesting about that right well we

56
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,470
were the first to get into this all the

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,390
other intelligence that was out there

58
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:49,420
just pointed to this being a basic

59
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:51,069
commodity crypto minor you know they

60
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,890
talks a little bit about the ability to

61
00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:55,390
spread by using a turtle blue which is

62
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:57,339
kind of the most advanced part we came

63
00:02:55,390 --> 00:03:00,309
across and we actually really dug into

64
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,989
this well I didn't cover some of the

65
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:04,120
really intended unique things that we

66
00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:06,430
found about the spot nets that made it

67
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,660
kind of for concern image so I just

68
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,250
wanted to highlight a couple of

69
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,049
write-ups throw me out there because

70
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,850
they're actually really good it just was

71
00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:15,070
like through the evolution of this

72
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:17,320
campaign and do this day they're still

73
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:19,390
evolving this campaign and expanding it

74
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,459
order to effect additional house and

75
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:24,880
just to expand their own reach and the

76
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:26,380
Indigo the substrates so why should we

77
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,030
care right why should you care this is a

78
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,440
crypto minor purse

79
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:31,750
you know something that

80
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,950
like leveraging the best of information

81
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:35,170
or something like that

82
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:37,149
well because companies are going to

83
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:39,459
handle these threats differently so if

84
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:41,710
you send someone a notification so

85
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:44,410
you're working for black or essentially

86
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:46,030
a vendor it doesn't points away so we

87
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,980
see all these different companies and

88
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:49,870
how they handle their threats and

89
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:52,179
various different ways so if we tell

90
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:54,340
them oh this is just like a PUA like

91
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:56,500
actually unwanted application crypto

92
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:59,890
money they're just like cool like let's

93
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:02,230
install it and mom but the thing is why

94
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:04,480
is important we really understand like

95
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:06,549
looking at the whole aspect of how these

96
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,489
systems become infected what else comes

97
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:11,830
entrance like Tshering payloads related

98
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:13,060
to these these pieces of malware this is

99
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:15,340
the fact that this is actually being a

100
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,170
lot of morbid attacks it's using a lot

101
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:19,870
of a building without system components

102
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:22,270
to maintain persistence expand the reach

103
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:24,310
into holes the organization and just the

104
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:26,469
systems they've compromised and so it's

105
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:28,150
a lot more to clean out them to say that

106
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:32,680
moving the crypto miners it's very

107
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:34,989
obvious with this so when we first came

108
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,610
across this we actually just had a

109
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:39,370
customer and you're doing a deployment

110
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:41,170
and the customer rolled out her black

111
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:43,630
defendants in this flag and they're like

112
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:46,000
you know we've got minor but what was

113
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:48,070
weird was just all the other stuff and

114
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,990
ourselves been doing there's a lot of

115
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:51,040
other activities that we were we're

116
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,240
picking up from this and they're like

117
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,340
it's just the right

118
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:58,370
because we actually saw different actors

119
00:04:55,340 --> 00:05:02,000
using the same situ networks to interact

120
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:03,380
with the soap so kind of interesting so

121
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,360
first we thought this is like a drive-by

122
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:07,520
download or something healthy got

123
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,410
affected we later find it found out that

124
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,260
they are actually using sob and WMI

125
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:15,470
respectively to do spreading across the

126
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:17,680
roles over the Internet and both within

127
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:20,150
the land once they get inside a company

128
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,210
so the initial drop rate establishes

129
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:24,530
persistence you have multiple different

130
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:27,080
mechanisms and we'll dive into a little

131
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:29,929
bit here I've essentially you know there

132
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:33,349
is a smoothly do music register 30 to

133
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:35,210
run DLL 32 all these abilities to

134
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:38,030
establish persistence to multiple

135
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:40,010
different situ servers they also did DNS

136
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:41,750
poisoning they did that so that they

137
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:43,280
could take out analysts where we're

138
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:45,169
going to look up hosts and stuff that

139
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,138
was involved to something else and throw

140
00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:49,280
us off the trail and they did all these

141
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:52,190
things just to make sure they were

142
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,109
maintaining this access and also making

143
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:57,350
the privileged access to certain

144
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:59,539
processes all of those crypto mining of

145
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:02,590
course they're just using XM something

146
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:02,590
you see very common

147
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:10,480
no accelerate is a very popular venereal

148
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:13,450
cryptocurrency minor and recent so

149
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,950
popular of nowhere as it uses the CPU so

150
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:17,469
you infect hundreds of thousands of

151
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:21,250
posts and just mine using the CPU you

152
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:23,470
can actually get a lot of and they're

153
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:25,810
also using the maternal glue to spread

154
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:27,610
laterally within organizations and

155
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:30,340
spread across the internet as well

156
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:32,860
and one of the real interesting things

157
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:35,739
here is you saw different people from

158
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:38,740
Russia and China actually leveraging

159
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:40,720
this back connects us to actually be

160
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:42,520
post exploitation activities on these

161
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,320
hoes and it's kind of interesting we'll

162
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,840
get into that a bit but what this turned

163
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,670
into is actually a much larger known as

164
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,440
a botnet spread except where these

165
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:52,930
services where you can print malware or

166
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:55,540
services and actually purchase access

167
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:59,220
into organizations and will breakdown

168
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:02,110
kind of that that way back in as well so

169
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:06,010
just know they're cooked an oddity minor

170
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:07,720
no definitely not a commodity minor so

171
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:10,420
using a lot of living off the land in

172
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,630
facts for persistence provision remote

173
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:13,760
access

174
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:16,340
ways they would also you know if they

175
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:18,860
compromised the server over the Internet

176
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:21,440
they would immediately acquire water is

177
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:23,750
to block level access so it's become

178
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,219
inaccurate they also have an initial

179
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:27,260
process of killing off and every

180
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:29,090
community minor that was out there they

181
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:31,130
have to list of files those costly

182
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:32,419
updated they would check and they were

183
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:33,950
just killing these off but make sure

184
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:35,780
that they were blacklist on this those

185
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:38,690
going forward it's only their remaining

186
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:41,179
software it actually be able to run and

187
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:42,890
the real interesting part is factor

188
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,140
sensitive data we'll get into that in

189
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:47,680
more detail in a bit

190
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:51,740
but multiple C 2 is DNS poisoning oh

191
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:54,620
stuff now who are they primarily going

192
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:57,200
after mostly Russia we saw a lot of

193
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:59,990
people in India China kind of all over

194
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:02,690
the place not so much in the United

195
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:04,640
States at this time so this is a proof

196
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:07,040
point and this is back about it here

197
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,539
together together this data so this is

198
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,490
now expanded quite a bit to actually

199
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,960
include a lot of what a United States

200
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:14,450
they're starting to spread and

201
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:17,299
continuing to kind of evolve their their

202
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:18,950
own coverage now what's interesting with

203
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:21,320
this in terms of like why is other

204
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:22,849
write-ups didn't include a lot of

205
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,730
details that we found here doing our

206
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:27,410
analysis it looks like so he came up

207
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:29,540
with a few different kind of scenarios

208
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:31,400
that line up with what's happened both

209
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:33,830
with this campaign within the news

210
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,809
within the cryptocurrency industry that

211
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:37,550
kind of lead to why they've looked at

212
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:40,549
expanding into different revenue streams

213
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:42,049
using the same malware so on the top

214
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:43,529
here you can see the value of Manero

215
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:47,040
over times this is

216
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:50,009
in 2016 beginning of 2016 to July of

217
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,629
this year and you can see a banana shot

218
00:08:50,009 --> 00:08:55,259
up for a while and it's been out there

219
00:08:51,629 --> 00:08:57,689
peep there but the actual small burner

220
00:08:55,259 --> 00:09:01,499
campaign it's been active for a while it

221
00:08:57,689 --> 00:09:04,079
really kicked off to like early 2017 and

222
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:06,199
at the point where they got about like

223
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:09,180
halfway through their mining operation

224
00:09:06,199 --> 00:09:10,979
and ISP actually caught on to what they

225
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:13,050
were doing and it's labeled a sinkhole

226
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,759
of one third of their entire binding

227
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:17,099
traffic so all of a sudden they lost

228
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:19,139
this massive amount of revenue right up

229
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:22,499
to this point they didn't mind over

230
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:24,720
8,000 Venera upwards of at the time

231
00:09:22,499 --> 00:09:26,129
worth about three billion dollars so

232
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,009
they've made quite a bit of money just

233
00:09:26,129 --> 00:09:31,499
for mining but at the same time you see

234
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:34,019
the price of arrow starts to give they

235
00:09:31,499 --> 00:09:36,300
were just simple all of a sudden you

236
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:38,730
know maybe that's when they decided to

237
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:40,589
shift tactics and start adding in the

238
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:43,290
fact of information and resale of that

239
00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:45,540
data that's another kind of tactic to I

240
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:47,579
kind of expand their apartment but

241
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:50,009
another interesting aspect here you see

242
00:09:47,579 --> 00:09:53,489
money Kings you know hear about my Kings

243
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:55,529
before my Kings is a pre massive

244
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:58,139
campaign and so this is actually this is

245
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:59,399
actually a botnet spreader this one of

246
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:02,189
these services where you can actually

247
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:02,790
rent out and buy you know malware this

248
00:10:02,189 --> 00:10:05,550
exists

249
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:07,680
companies we ended up dubbing that's

250
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:10,500
essentially access mining we just buy

251
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,329
your way in to organizations this is a

252
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,970
great place to do that is through the

253
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:16,290
whole of my things kind of Network and

254
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:18,420
what's interesting is we actually found

255
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:20,550
a link between these two campaigns

256
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:22,229
actually shows that the guys who created

257
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:24,569
small burgerito actually were the

258
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:26,700
founders of my Kings we're able to

259
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:30,870
definitely link them together kind of

260
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:34,620
interesting so you will care care

261
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:36,570
dollars so what I wanted to show you

262
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:38,700
guys is just a high level overview of

263
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:41,010
like this is actually everything that

264
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:43,140
this one piece of malware is doing once

265
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:44,670
it infects your system now we're not

266
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:46,800
going to break down all of this because

267
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:50,640
I only have 30 minutes but it's crazy

268
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:53,099
right there's a lot of so I'm gonna

269
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,410
do some highlights we'll just take a

270
00:10:53,100 --> 00:11:02,210
look at a couple of the fun stuff once

271
00:10:55,410 --> 00:11:05,610
this is over I'm gonna play all over

272
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:07,440
alright so some high that's right so

273
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:10,470
it's all agree the funny thing about

274
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,000
this like India as we look at this every

275
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,890
you know a couple of days they were

276
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,680
changing the names of ivories that

277
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:17,319
changing the hashes every single system

278
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,109
you

279
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:22,210
is updated with new hashes so like you

280
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:24,790
can use signature detection to stop this

281
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:26,110
is something where there's too many like

282
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:27,069
different types of payloads and

283
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:29,860
different methods that they've

284
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:31,510
implemented to infect systems but it was

285
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:34,330
something where we have no actual

286
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:37,630
behavioral techniques and we'll get to

287
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:40,240
what they're actually doing some of the

288
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:42,189
Arsenal a lot of this was PowerShell and

289
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,350
the funny thing about all the PowerShell

290
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:46,480
they're using none of its encoded if

291
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:48,700
there's one piece that's an encoded

292
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,500
PowerShell command and it's the street W

293
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,720
my event subscription creation

294
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,100
everything else is like plain text and

295
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,970
it's like they're not even trying to

296
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:59,440
hide like these guys do not care at all

297
00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:01,750
one of the things they do this kind of

298
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,910
interesting is a repurposed a lot of

299
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:07,660
existing libraries Fulford malware

300
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:10,810
writers or existing Windows system

301
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:12,250
components like the Capitals most they

302
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:13,959
and I ended up bringing their own

303
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:19,150
versions these files and switching them

304
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:19,930
out on the portal s what those are used

305
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:22,900
for in a bit

306
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:27,579
are these 80 cats both binary version

307
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:29,530
and the PowerShell version a lot of

308
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:32,320
crypto miners you know some sometimes

309
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:34,630
they would actually change miners or

310
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,400
they would induce like weird stuff like

311
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:40,570
injecting other processes and brining

312
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:42,010
from that but a lot of us came not to at

313
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:43,900
the end of the day it was started with

314
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:46,060
PowerShell and ended with PowerShell and

315
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:50,590
BB scripts and that's how they did their

316
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:52,089
data collection and exfiltration so what

317
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:53,480
does this look like when you initially

318
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:55,520
get affected

319
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,680
and this is the initial command line

320
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:59,360
that you'll see on an employment that's

321
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,370
getting infected with the small and

322
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,830
ergonomic this is what it looks like

323
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:05,930
when it comes in via an eternal bloom so

324
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:08,990
someone scans to those needs access

325
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:10,969
immediately execute see schematic we

326
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:13,460
actually got a hold of their actual

327
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:17,210
original payloads that they were using

328
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:19,070
and we'll show that but that first

329
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:21,170
command there that's just creating that

330
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:23,270
WI and that subscription and so they're

331
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:25,130
trying to do this very first thing

332
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:26,860
establish that persistence make sure

333
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:29,630
they have a way back into the system

334
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:32,120
these next couple scripts a lot of them

335
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:34,040
just pull down different lists of pilots

336
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:37,160
or other miners that they want to get

337
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,560
all other know pieces of data that

338
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,209
they're kind of interested in collecting

339
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,189
so they all have various specific jobs

340
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:45,830
and every time you run this these will

341
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:47,750
will be updated as well so it'll from

342
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:51,230
different posts these are changing kind

343
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:53,540
of constantly that's what goes next

344
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:55,790
like download stream kind of sections

345
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:58,760
are violated but then at the bottom when

346
00:13:55,790 --> 00:14:01,459
you see register 32 that's using a fully

347
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:04,220
new method to establish persistence to

348
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:07,010
in this case three different CTU servers

349
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:08,810
to pull those down and and ran them and

350
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:11,240
it's funny because they're not stages

351
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:13,099
like it says one two three they're just

352
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:15,140
literally like different SI toos that

353
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:19,640
it's pulling back to after establishes

354
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:21,290
persistence so this first stage after

355
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:24,949
some of the binaries that are actually

356
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:26,660
dropped once the PowerShell executes are

357
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:28,970
these three files which are kind of the

358
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:32,810
key here and now at this point these

359
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:34,640
names of these files have changed so you

360
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:35,930
know it's something where every week

361
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,939
we're kind of running through this year

362
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:40,160
modifying you know which these files are

363
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:42,800
but that's

364
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,719
listen we would just going to overwrite

365
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,670
the Master Boot Record so when we were

366
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,620
detonating this within our early animals

367
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:50,180
we were finding it was crashing and it

368
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:51,829
was due to this so we had to actually

369
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:54,109
test this on some bare metal just to

370
00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:56,599
make sure we got the whole telemetry of

371
00:14:54,110 --> 00:15:00,829
all this happening here I'm gonna skip

372
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:03,430
over yes yes EPX per second but you do

373
00:15:00,829 --> 00:15:05,660
not yet see it's kind of a secondary

374
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:08,508
secondary payload that did a lot of the

375
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:09,829
DNS poisoning and rather traffic so as

376
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:12,769
you're making her plus they would

377
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:14,508
actually go through a unity XE or it

378
00:15:12,769 --> 00:15:17,180
would inject into another process so

379
00:15:14,509 --> 00:15:22,639
into control and what you were we were

380
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:24,469
able to do look that side well PSC px is

381
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,720
like kind of where all of the other

382
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:29,389
magic comes from this is like the core

383
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,779
binary that delivers everything else

384
00:15:29,389 --> 00:15:34,610
that ended up being more interesting in

385
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:38,180
terms of weight we have time to talk

386
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:41,660
about here the mining itself turned out

387
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:44,420
to be actually like the most innocuous

388
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:46,519
part of this whole thing so most funny

389
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:48,920
is this miner actually sleeps for 14

390
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:50,800
hours after every time you need them out

391
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,110
so they want to wait till your death

392
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,508
basically they're definitely not

393
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:58,329
touching the subtle support it puts on

394
00:15:55,509 --> 00:15:59,230
and once you vote into the poster you

395
00:15:58,329 --> 00:16:00,488
you know

396
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:03,670
move the mouse or something like that

397
00:16:00,489 --> 00:16:07,179
immediately stops kills the process and

398
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:10,449
just disappears entirely until until the

399
00:16:07,179 --> 00:16:13,480
next time it starts up again now this

400
00:16:10,449 --> 00:16:16,299
would we do remote access here this is

401
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:19,779
just an example of one of these one of

402
00:16:16,299 --> 00:16:22,089
the pages that has been called by this

403
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:24,999
piece of malware so as you can see here

404
00:16:22,089 --> 00:16:28,689
we're just running W script show VF

405
00:16:24,999 --> 00:16:30,699
command dot exe to use J scripts to run

406
00:16:28,689 --> 00:16:33,790
all of our code here which is just

407
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:36,219
shellcode shoveling a shell out and this

408
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:39,099
is set up to run on jobs this runs just

409
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:42,040
scheduled over time kind of maintain

410
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:43,899
that access over time so by the way if

411
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,849
you're looking for good new protections

412
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:47,769
anytime you see Chaney script running

413
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:50,199
anything like PowerShell command I

414
00:16:47,769 --> 00:16:54,399
excellent a script that's a solid

415
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:57,128
indicator third but the next interesting

416
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:59,110
thing is the eternal is the best bet so

417
00:16:57,129 --> 00:17:00,999
anything your player on the open source

418
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:03,459
you know after the shadow brokers leak

419
00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:06,370
and all that all the tools came out and

420
00:17:03,459 --> 00:17:09,188
everything so this is one of those

421
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:11,229
repositories that kind of made some

422
00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:11,649
modifications the tool said it worked

423
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,439
before

424
00:17:11,648 --> 00:17:17,829
easier but out but it's actually they

425
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:20,250
all they cloned the skin Oh Riko and

426
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:24,279
added their own

427
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:25,869
exploitation code to to the actual

428
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:28,649
eternal payloads

429
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:31,029
so this is what it actually looks like

430
00:17:28,649 --> 00:17:34,418
so everything in here you see is exactly

431
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:38,179
as it is within Megiddo except for this

432
00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:40,220
part so already here is just basically

433
00:17:38,179 --> 00:17:42,350
that are going to execute once you

434
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:45,980
actually successfully exploit the system

435
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:47,748
using eternal blue so over here if you

436
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:49,999
want to read through this I think I can

437
00:17:47,749 --> 00:17:52,549
send this to you later but essentially

438
00:17:49,999 --> 00:17:55,519
this is just running everything that we

439
00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:58,190
saw initially you know setting up the W

440
00:17:55,519 --> 00:18:01,490
like resistance establishing persistence

441
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:05,230
on the host basically making sure that

442
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:05,230
they have a really good for this house

443
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,509
now where this gets really interesting

444
00:18:09,259 --> 00:18:13,820
and where we started having a little too

445
00:18:11,509 --> 00:18:19,129
much fun with this is what gets into the

446
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:21,769
part about access money so what is mine

447
00:18:19,129 --> 00:18:24,019
is is essentially when you've steal data

448
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:26,350
from a host so say you've compromised

449
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:29,509
this house steal the usernames passwords

450
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:31,610
domain information on a more direct

451
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:34,490
access to the host and then you take

452
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:36,678
that data pushed up to a deep I park it

453
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:39,049
and actually sell it directly so you

454
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:42,019
know and by direct access into

455
00:18:39,049 --> 00:18:43,700
organization by credentials to a company

456
00:18:42,019 --> 00:18:49,249
some of these are either just straight

457
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:51,649
RDP open but they also do a lot of math

458
00:18:49,249 --> 00:18:53,929
across needs and look at you know how

459
00:18:51,649 --> 00:18:56,059
their price is when they sell so they

460
00:18:53,929 --> 00:18:58,100
will sell those for different values

461
00:18:56,059 --> 00:19:02,690
depending on the speed you know is this

462
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:05,178
a fast processing was the network

463
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:06,860
throughput is this a main target

464
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:11,059
organization some of those go for

465
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:13,070
thousands of dollars so this piece of

466
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:15,259
malware the pieces kind of highlighted

467
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:19,668
here with the actually what actually

468
00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:22,850
does this script sts-1 powershell script

469
00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:25,129
goes out and it downloads s context

470
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:27,740
which contains all the w my persistence

471
00:19:25,129 --> 00:19:31,399
kind of mechanisms runs that and then

472
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:33,590
those downloads I held on text kills all

473
00:19:31,399 --> 00:19:36,439
the processes listed within that and

474
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:38,990
then it downloads an execute the script

475
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:41,690
called up dot text and what up context

476
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:42,110
does is it just wipes information on the

477
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,730
host

478
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:45,769
yeah those credentials domain

479
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:48,109
information all that kind of stuff and

480
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:52,070
then it uploads it the FTP

481
00:19:48,109 --> 00:19:56,689
just directly to be saw your plain text

482
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:58,249
so but here's actually what that script

483
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:59,179
looks like it's funny they didn't

484
00:19:58,249 --> 00:20:02,090
obfuscate

485
00:19:59,179 --> 00:20:03,980
needless so we were taking a look at

486
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:05,269
this it's pretty straightforward right

487
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:08,539
they're looking at what's your external

488
00:20:05,269 --> 00:20:10,940
IP what are the processes running on

489
00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:14,330
your host and this is after they've

490
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:16,029
killed them as well I figure pretty us

491
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:19,039
we're version windows are going

492
00:20:16,029 --> 00:20:20,749
calculate the memory capacity could be

493
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,759
cuter you know how they're going to

494
00:20:20,749 --> 00:20:25,460
price this later

495
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:27,139
with CPU information basically you know

496
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:28,879
is this gonna be the sister of finding

497
00:20:27,139 --> 00:20:32,570
something morning just for something

498
00:20:28,879 --> 00:20:34,789
else so then it goes one points this is

499
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:37,609
the second half of the script here so

500
00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:40,730
right here anyone recognize this will

501
00:20:37,609 --> 00:20:42,070
power sploit maybe pets so just directly

502
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:44,680
pulled out from their game

503
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:46,600
and executed then here they're just

504
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:49,690
basically writing all this data to a raw

505
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:52,889
text file and then here is where they

506
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:56,730
upload over FTP you didn't see anything

507
00:20:52,890 --> 00:21:02,500
interesting here about that Tiki part

508
00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:07,360
yeah so I like the twenty these guys do

509
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:10,330
not give a right I don't care if we

510
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,100
find it so else finds it like tell us

511
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:16,480
the people are guaranteed monitoring

512
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:18,520
these guys on top of us so you know it's

513
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,740
just kind of funny to see how how open

514
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:22,900
yeah as long as it actually focus on are

515
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:24,460
really trying to you don't understand

516
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:26,350
how they're trying to hide how they're

517
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:29,800
using encoding and stuff like that to me

518
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:31,419
to evade but just in our honoring of

519
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,610
this we found over a hundred thousand

520
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:36,340
unique infections from this one FTP

521
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:38,709
server now this was one FTP server out

522
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:40,620
of six at the time so there multiple of

523
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:43,690
these going to different locations all

524
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:45,250
uploading data in the same way we looked

525
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:53,470
at some of the other research work that

526
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:56,080
was out there so we've got over 500

527
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:59,170
thousand unique infections just within a

528
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:01,419
week of this so you can see how how

529
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:04,420
actually pretty large this campaign is

530
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:06,780
for being such a simple and a piece of

531
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:09,370
malware preferred for what they're doing

532
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:11,230
but this really gets back to like you

533
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:13,060
know when you have these potentially

534
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:15,250
unwanted applications and things like

535
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:17,409
that that you may not view as a big deal

536
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:19,570
on your network you do really want to

537
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:21,010
think about it as like you know is this

538
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:23,230
doing something else that I don't know

539
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:23,850
about what happened when this was loaded

540
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,440
on mice

541
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:28,110
you know you want to get that whole

542
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:30,059
attack chain to understand and really

543
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:32,250
make sure that you're not letting other

544
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:34,260
aspects kind of slip by

545
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:36,390
because with this case a lot of the

546
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:39,090
people that haven't we talked to about

547
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:41,070
this one in particular basically just

548
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:43,860
went we needed the binary but still had

549
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:45,809
all the existing persistence mechanisms

550
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:50,459
in place so something that was just

551
00:22:45,809 --> 00:22:56,070
completely mixed so Jesus says about

552
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:58,470
what kind of no it's not stopping there

553
00:22:56,070 --> 00:23:01,020
I want to go into mapping out the

554
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:02,640
infrastructure these guys this is the

555
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,720
part I can't I can't show kind of

556
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,960
everything because they're actually

557
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:09,210
still actively doing some fun stuff with

558
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:12,330
these guys cover the stuff that's kind

559
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:14,700
of out there already so this is one of

560
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:17,668
that TP servers we're looking at just

561
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:19,260
the history historical data around the

562
00:23:17,669 --> 00:23:21,659
set TP server and a lot of their other

563
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:23,220
infrastructure that we found initially

564
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:25,049
we're thinking this is actually a

565
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:28,049
Chinese campaign because we saw a lot of

566
00:23:25,049 --> 00:23:30,389
Chinese malware you know within yeah

567
00:23:28,049 --> 00:23:31,740
exif data some of the libraries were

568
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:34,080
looking at and just some of the

569
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:37,730
communications we saw on the back end

570
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:40,320
but that we may not have gotten into

571
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:42,059
essentially we it's kind of interesting

572
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,129
because this is actually just a

573
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:46,168
compromised server we thought that this

574
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:47,909
is one word you know this is one of many

575
00:23:46,169 --> 00:23:49,980
servers they took over and they just

576
00:23:47,909 --> 00:23:52,470
started assigning their own DNS entries

577
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:56,909
to these compromised servers in order to

578
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:58,880
maintain their their persistence so once

579
00:23:56,909 --> 00:24:01,800
we started pulling these

580
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,270
the commonalities between them we

581
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,460
actually found this one which is kind of

582
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:08,250
interesting bill kill me now at

583
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:09,780
gmail.com this address if you do any

584
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:11,490
research on this you actually see

585
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:15,210
they're tied to a lot of interesting

586
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:17,760
stuff out there including I so not just

587
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:21,390
the small McGrew campaign but they're

588
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:23,340
also tied to my kids which my Kings is a

589
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:25,080
lot bigger this is where it's actually

590
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:28,290
getting into you know Russian much

591
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:32,129
larger and you know nation state level

592
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:33,480
kind of campaigns and so tying these

593
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:36,510
together is kind of interesting

594
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:39,900
we're actually able to find a gap in the

595
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:42,660
historical registration or one of these

596
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:45,330
domains so my Kings dot PW used to be

597
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:48,170
one of their main primary domains they

598
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:52,020
had a lot of kind of coordination with

599
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:53,370
all the other Vikings kind of work well

600
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:55,740
you can see a bunch of these other ones

601
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:59,280
are actually still active but like in

602
00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:02,040
some PW is kind of one almost funny is

603
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:04,200
that the guy actually led with their

604
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:06,120
private registration expired at one

605
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,730
point and so they had this gap that they

606
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:11,010
actually got their email associated the

607
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:13,559
funny thing too quickly after this they

608
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:16,200
switch and all of a sudden Alex I'm very

609
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:17,910
a mail drop for us so as soon as they

610
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,350
saw this was exposed they switched it

611
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:22,470
and now it's still our kind of the

612
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:24,899
register again so we decided to switch

613
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:27,059
to phone numbers phone numbers are fun

614
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:31,770
you're trying to get across and see who

615
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:33,928
owns doing all of these came back to the

616
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:35,460
same Russian phone number just kind of

617
00:25:33,929 --> 00:25:37,380
weird right it's not something that's

618
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:39,730
even validated when you create a domain

619
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:41,500
so why use something that you have

620
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:45,060
actually they use the same across

621
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:50,410
everything else for whatever reason did

622
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:53,350
how many of these are all the names

623
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:54,010
associated with each of these so this is

624
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:56,230
the phone number

625
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:58,780
it's a Russian phone number that's

626
00:25:56,230 --> 00:26:00,640
associated with all these registries of

627
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:02,350
domains as for me they usually say the

628
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,860
phone number but then these names like

629
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:08,820
na or and EF and stuff like that so it's

630
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:15,610
just kind of funny that that they would

631
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:20,139
know we should we should call it now how

632
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:21,729
much does that cost to come Russia but

633
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:23,350
then there's the Iraqis these are all

634
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:25,210
the IPS that are associated with that

635
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:28,629
same domain so kind of interesting right

636
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:40,780
so where does this go this goes to a

637
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:41,860
Moscow taxi company like is this is what

638
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:43,899
it looks like there's like a little

639
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:45,399
train station behind there and stuff so

640
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:47,310
so I don't know it's just kind of weird

641
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:50,080
that they will sign up to use the same

642
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:52,149
same connection we did find some other

643
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:55,929
stuff but you had to talk to you about

644
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:59,380
over beers later but but for now to just

645
00:26:55,930 --> 00:27:01,270
keep it to what's out there so the

646
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:03,520
physical location of these the ones that

647
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:07,450
are actually owned by the adversary

648
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:08,690
we're all based Russia the other ones

649
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:11,030
that we found all

650
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:12,470
being compromised assets so there are

651
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:14,060
all those servers that you know within

652
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:16,670
the United States they've taken over

653
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:18,139
quite a few of us they're mostly on IAS

654
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:20,240
servers and they were just going out

655
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:22,850
popping these servers and then deploying

656
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,590
either FTP or their own web servers to

657
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:27,980
them to handle different aspects of the

658
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:29,780
overall security the other aspect is

659
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:32,060
kind of interesting so bill killed me

660
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:34,490
now is kind of the main email address

661
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:36,649
that's associated with this campaign we

662
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:39,560
also found this one that's associated

663
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:41,360
with almost all of the Vikings works but

664
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:43,790
not this momentary one's kind of

665
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:46,850
interesting this is a glad I didn't talk

666
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:50,659
and 86ed me of are you kind of an

667
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:52,240
interesting one and that one we can talk

668
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:55,640
about that later

669
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:58,040
but so excess mining work places anyone

670
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:00,500
here hangout the government on Deep Web

671
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:03,560
and like have run into any of these kind

672
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:05,230
of places so so this one right here we

673
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:07,909
were looking at as a login form to a

674
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:09,920
desktop protocol shop so what they're

675
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:13,640
selling here is just direct access into

676
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:15,230
systems that are compromised or RDP so a

677
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:17,690
lot of these you come into home

678
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:19,789
some that just give you an actual login

679
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:22,639
form one of these we found they actually

680
00:28:19,789 --> 00:28:24,919
use a guacamole to play there rather

681
00:28:22,639 --> 00:28:26,899
than face a might log into their their

682
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:28,789
server like it's pretty legit it's like

683
00:28:26,899 --> 00:28:31,789
better than some commercial stuff is out

684
00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:34,370
there this is what the actual page looks

685
00:28:31,789 --> 00:28:37,519
like like bring by access to these to

686
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:40,760
these systems so over here you see the

687
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:42,559
IP and actually when you purchase you'll

688
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,029
get the whole IP they won't show it to

689
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:46,639
you until because they don't want you to

690
00:28:44,029 --> 00:28:50,929
just go pop it yourself whether it shows

691
00:28:46,639 --> 00:28:55,760
the country shows stay city zip code

692
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:57,139
even shows the OS Ram speed all that cut

693
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:00,200
stuff and then it's all priced

694
00:28:57,139 --> 00:29:07,879
accordingly based on all right I got 30

695
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:09,740
seconds 29 seconds so okay overall we

696
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:12,260
saw a majority these are about five

697
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:14,149
dollars of those well there are some you

698
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:16,100
know and in the middle range like twelve

699
00:29:14,149 --> 00:29:18,620
dollars or so seem to be kind of average

700
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:20,750
for like a pretty decent post for

701
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:23,120
getting access to and this is across all

702
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:26,210
of the access mining marketplaces and

703
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:29,090
not just already one so kind of

704
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:31,669
interesting but over time we're seeing

705
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:33,199
this steadily increase in terms of the

706
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:35,929
amount of systems that are available and

707
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,700
the price so it was definitely something

708
00:29:35,929 --> 00:29:41,269
that we're seeing kind of growing in

709
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:44,450
terms of a service a service offering if

710
00:29:41,269 --> 00:29:46,250
you will but the very last piece I

711
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:48,890
wanted to touch on is what they're

712
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:51,630
actually doing with the cryptocurrency

713
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:53,930
and in here play around with tumblers

714
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:57,090
Bitcoin tumblers it's stuff like that

715
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:59,370
well I chose this one to highlight is

716
00:29:57,090 --> 00:30:01,679
this one specific for an arrow so

717
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:03,270
basically this is pre longer points you

718
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:06,090
can push the Monaro to this and then

719
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:08,070
push hit client and then you can give

720
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:10,080
different types of coins out of it this

721
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:12,419
makes it really easy longer that's funny

722
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,550
so it's kind of one of the ways I'm

723
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:16,980
gonna shuffle the points through push it

724
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:18,870
down to a Pete wallet transferred over

725
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:21,600
to another wallet actually take money

726
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:35,669
out now course there's stuff like cheat

727
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:38,270
Alice's and questions alright perfect

728
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:38,270
I'm gonna keep going

729
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:45,000
basically once very short like it's hard

730
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:47,760
to condense all this down this is

731
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,130
originally like a couple our briefing to

732
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:52,290
run through but essentially all of this

733
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:54,690
is rapidly changing it shows kind of

734
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:57,690
that need to really focus on you know it

735
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:59,880
may just come off as a QA or adware or

736
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:01,650
something like that but oftentimes it

737
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,330
has all these ulterior motives

738
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:05,460
associated with that to make it more

739
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:06,000
profitable for the person who owns the

740
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:08,460
bhana

741
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,170
so we definitely want to look into all

742
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:13,260
of these things and treat them all kind

743
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:16,260
of with the same level record so that's

744
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:17,760
kind of the main the main point here but

745
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:21,020
if you want to read more about this we

746
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:24,290
actually have threat intelligence

747
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:25,879
this we have some posts on our customers

748
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:27,980
portal as well that goes like some

749
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:30,200
inquiries of things they can find this

750
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:32,750
activity and then we have a white paper

751
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:36,310
that talks more about the larger aspect

752
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:36,310
of access line in general
