after lunch so this may be a sleepy

00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:29,698
recession advice I think over you first

4
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,820
thing you notice is why bother with

5
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:33,890
making these expose discovery I can't

6
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:47,600
worry about this

00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:51,449
I brought some things for tenders

00:00:47,600 --> 00:01:16,960

00:00:51,449 --> 00:01:26,620

[Music]

11
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:31,880
so I think this traffic can be happening

12
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:34,940
you're not passing it out pass the

13
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:48,080
signal grabbers doing that so it can be

14
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:50,690
active even if you have a case to be

15
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:53,929
aware of possible possible ways that you

16
00:01:50,690 --> 00:02:01,550
can discover information about above

17
00:01:53,930 --> 00:02:13,580
system that your other being again a

18
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:27,260
little bit more about why so six using

19
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:29,750
it it's enabled by default local

20
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:35,780
segments even if you're not supposed to

21
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:38,270
be using it again so if you get a rap

22
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:40,400
for the species capable it's gonna

23
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:42,770
request a v6 address your providers

24
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,440
table that's going to give it to you so

25
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:46,700
your device may be accessible

26
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,800
somebody's device may be accessible they

27
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:52,570
may not know about their cloud providers

28
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:57,380
making it easier that's a check box

29
00:02:52,570 --> 00:03:00,200
depending on which some people are just

30
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:01,710
enabling we can do it

[Music]

32
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:05,970
there's a reasonable probability of

33
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,310
similar security so certainly that in

34
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:11,370
the visible but a lot of the devices out

35
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:46,890
there don't necessarily perfect maybe

36
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:49,770
better eye than before less 196 what's

37
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:52,829
familiar those territories important and

38
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:56,280
heart opposed inventory is whether these

39
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:58,410
would be six traceroute is still trace

40
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,110
route command aims a little different be

41
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:10,350
six and you're still paying stuff

42
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:12,900
ICMP layer it's still the same it's just

43
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:15,150
people just the IP layer or anything

44
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:17,250
that's extracting packets or dealing

45
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:25,230
directly with any later that needs to

46
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:27,570
change so what's neat about the enter

47
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,950
space I need more hemisphere so instead

48
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:32,450
of

49
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:37,700
that's between the segments you've got

50
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:51,159
colons and instead I see fit you've got

51
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:51,159
16 bits per segment versus four times

52
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:58,340
much larger I need FFA so if you're a

53
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:00,860
business and you need is a converse

54
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:03,650
basis or service writer is a lot of

55
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:05,480
cases going to give you a / 48 as any

56
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:09,440
bits of address space that you can

57
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:12,560
decimal which is great lot of IP

58
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:18,560
addresses the need for that is

59
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:22,460
essentially reduced it's not all it's

60
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:26,420
not all these are any good a / 56 is

61
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:28,070
fairly common as well - 72 bits this 564

62
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:32,180
is that generally recommended minimum

63
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:34,040
allocation so the recommendation from

64
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:36,470
you inherited right the Reaper

65
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:38,420
registries is if you know there's only

66
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:42,350
going to be a single second site subnet

67
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:45,770
so they assigned us 564 I'm not all

68
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:47,780
surprises are doing that I may be

69
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:49,669
somewhat less than that but even on a

70
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:53,840
cable modem you're going to have

71
00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:56,030

mattress discovery messing mechanism so

00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:08,448
heart is not part of my 26 miracle

00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:10,610

only used on the local segment single a

BCP minor brings same wrap table

make those discovery today collection

what's the same is really too much

thanks for just scanning we'll talk more

00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:12,259
about that later look like these I've

87
00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:14,810
mentioned this a little bit v6 machine

88
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:18,439
v6 enabled you're always going to have a

89

adverse autumn assignment name is

91

neighbor discovery some other things

92
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:29,419
even your neighbors probably I'm gonna

93
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:31,729
see most of this segment because it

94
00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:32,909
doesn't really need to know that you've

95
00:07:31,729 --> 00:07:34,590
got two machines are

96
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:39,240
and he's talked to each other they're

97
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:42,840
doing discovery to me though this can

98
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:46,680
facilitate silent toasts that never talk

99
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:48,359
outside segments so this is normally use

100
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,740
cases for this containers maybe like

101
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:54,420
this and that container is maybe only

102
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:56,370
talking to applications that live on

103
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:58,380
that segment pack tank doesn't happen

104
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:00,720
directly to the containers you patch the

105
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:02,100
host so it may never actually need to

106
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,200
talk outside of the segment so that's a

107
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:06,210
normal use case but it's also a

108
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,820
technique used by malicious or

109
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:11,690
compromised host so it does make be

110
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:29,940
aware of that local psychic traffic

111
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:33,210
that's becoming more a few people so a

112
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:34,470
lot of times flex is terrific on that

113
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,820
later three boundaries so that are

114
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:39,030
rather an eight-way whatever you want to

115
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:41,060
call it because of all this local

116
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:45,329
traffic and the local only IP addresses

117
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:48,329
there can a lot of traffic that you're

118
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:50,370
not going to seeing that so it's instead

119
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:52,310
of doing it a layer three boundary it

120
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:55,920
really don't want to do that at

121
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:58,170
basically every single switch to S flow

122
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:02,150
is this kind of a redundant protocol for

123
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:02,150
switches that's going to become

124
00:09:02,680 --> 00:10:00,279
some visibility a lot of probably

125
00:09:54,950 --> 00:10:00,279
something like Staffie or something

126
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:20,990
there may be some may want to consider a

127
00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:24,290
firewall rule host pretty common for

128
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:26,690
local broadcasts I've been opening the

129
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:30,170
broadcast and result in the service

130
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:36,200
degradation and ordaz sit so similar

131
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:38,180
here with this multicast in some more

132
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:42,730
things to address every subscriber image

133
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:45,709
and then DP replaces art for a v6

134
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:48,339
there's a potential or neighbor - Tyesha

135
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:48,339
so

136
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:56,990
2456 hosts there with the expands that

137
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:59,388
address space of ipv6 you can

138
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:03,529
potentially have a much larger number of

139
00:10:59,389 --> 00:11:05,870
theoretical IDs on Linux if you want to

140
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:08,360
look at your your 86 neighborhood

141
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:12,350
there's a slightly different command so

142
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:14,959
I mean - snicks neighbors show an NDP

143
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:17,569
mind if you want another like you use it

144
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:44,029
to like look at what's going on that's a

145
00:11:17,569 --> 00:11:46,610
neat tool - and maybe your your client

146
00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:49,819
or whoever james hasn't maybe not

147
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:55,639
updated there so somebody v6 awareness I

148
00:11:49,819 --> 00:11:57,949
can't can be again the few things that

149
00:11:55,639 --> 00:12:01,880
work that still work from the attacker

150
00:11:57,949 --> 00:12:04,310
perspective and DNS finding stuff via

151
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:09,170
DNS works search engines sure there's

152
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:12,469
actually gotta support Google stuff

153
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:14,240
application analysis and what the

154
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:16,459
application is doing with the code level

155
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:21,199
and again

156
00:12:16,459 --> 00:12:23,989
traceroute expands rather than sister

157
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:29,990
BGP working license that that kind of

158
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:32,060
host or these subnet level discovery we

159
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:35,060
just touched a lot of information about

160
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:50,160
the applications what IP ranges

161
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:53,430
organizations still work generally most

162
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:57,620
things above the acne later the choosing

163
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:57,620
for source of information today was over

164
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:10,649
thanks for just scamming so that's a

165
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:13,290
common thread for standing to be

166
00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:17,990
invested research and reconnaissance

167
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:17,990
from an external perspective here we go

168
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:24,209
you may have authorization to scan the

169
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:26,760
network but you notice inside the

170
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:33,750
network research memory contents becomes

171
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:38,430
more important space more difficult to

172
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:40,649
find my person just by brute force and

173
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:41,880
finding ways to use that the data from

174
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:44,480
your reconnaissance quickly and

175
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:55,200
effectively to improve your scanning

176
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:59,250
processes so the scanning TV scanning

177
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:03,630
manageable so the broad abroad address

178
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:05,970
space in your class 64 64 bits of

179
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:07,170
address space you're probably not going

180
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,389
to stay in that

181
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:11,849
before so your name bring data from

182
00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:15,059
other sources which in several already

183
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:16,709
there's a many other suggests a lot of

184
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:19,529
with the current stuff if you're doing

185
00:14:16,709 --> 00:14:24,299
extensive reconnaissance and analysis as

186
00:14:19,529 --> 00:14:26,669
part of them or an engagement a lot of

187
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:30,059
that stuff still works that information

188
00:14:26,669 --> 00:14:31,009
is becoming more important a good before

189
00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:35,040
Stan

190
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:37,350
it's important so just just because v6

191
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,169
is available might be fun to play with

192
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:43,699
having a good before skiing will help

193
00:14:40,169 --> 00:14:46,439
inform your be sixty and a lot of times

194
00:14:43,699 --> 00:14:52,709
we're gonna line up and this is

195
00:14:46,439 --> 00:14:55,858
obviously going to be different and

196
00:14:52,709 --> 00:15:07,858
there's some some shortcuts that people

197
00:14:55,859 --> 00:15:10,980
may use for addressing also ups that are

198
00:15:07,859 --> 00:15:13,739
actually in use so you have to discover

199
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:20,749
them if somebody's got a device that's

200
00:15:13,739 --> 00:15:23,040
using your assistant something to try

201
00:15:20,749 --> 00:15:27,989
some neighbor caps I have issues I've

202
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:32,488
mentioned this briefly so if this knife

203
00:15:27,989 --> 00:15:35,399
64 is the smallest subnet that that gets

204
00:15:32,489 --> 00:15:37,110
assigned and that's to the 64 potential

205
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:40,410
neighbor man things obviously know Bose

206
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:43,410
can hold em any potential neighbor

207
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:46,079
mappings so if that people fills up

208
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:48,449
there's potential for post- so you could

209
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:52,040
have a hostess and

210
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:56,490
but your skin misses it because that

211
00:15:52,040 --> 00:16:00,230
neighbor discovered a table visible so

212
00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:03,480
that has some implications for scan rate

213
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:07,410
there's some extra incentive to paralyze

214
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:10,730
your scan understand your network scan

215
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:13,680
to scan multiple subnets simultaneously

216
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:16,770
there's there is a potential for a

217
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:20,189
service that device mother's going to go

218
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:22,740
down but other devices on that on that

219
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:24,720
network main may not be able to get

220
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:27,990
there and entries him into that neighbor

221
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,760
the neighbor table so they may not be

222
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:33,270
able to get outside their segment for

223
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:34,770
some period of time obviously internal

224
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:37,020
person trying to scan their network

225
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:40,020
trying to understand the hosts inventory

226
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:42,960
you don't want a US or so if you're

227
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:44,430
coming the outside I don't want to have

228
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:48,240
a service that's an indication of

229
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:50,670
something might be happening packets not

230
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,730
flowing generally not going to make

231
00:16:50,670 --> 00:17:02,790
Britain client unless it's a kind of a

232
00:16:53,730 --> 00:17:04,470
specific type of exercise a a little bit

233
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:07,579
more in the attached besides us using

234
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:07,579
very much

235
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:14,490
incomplete neighbor discovery entries

236
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,609
are generally held for three seconds so

237
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:20,910
just running a quick calculation if

238
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:22,349
there's a 512 entry limit that generally

239
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:24,660
means you can scan probably about a

240
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:28,409
hundred and seventy unique IDs per

241
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:30,630
second on that segment without busting

242
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:33,180
that neighbor discovery catch if they

243
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:35,250
time is longer just over five seconds

244
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:37,290
it's about a hundred you can do the math

245
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:39,380
and I'm breaking it down

246
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:42,379
but again controlling your scan rate

247
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:42,380
becomes

248
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:47,779
[Applause]

249
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:57,009
[Music]

250
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:15,120
paralyzing your stands reduce their

251
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:18,330
subnet sizes again to reduce the risk of

252
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:21,399
busting the neighbor discovery table

253
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:23,470
which could could actually make standing

254
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:27,070
a little easier so there's something to

255
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:31,000
keep an eye out for there's some

256
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:33,280
benefits today for an admin but there's

257
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:37,470
also benefits to having a broad address

258
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:40,800
pool with hosts that are hard to find so

259
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:43,600
gaining a foothold so when you

260
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:45,129
especially from that outside when you

261
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,459
start to skin you don't necessarily know

262
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:52,870
a huge amount about the network but

263
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:54,820
there's some initial initial techniques

264
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:57,610
that you can use to start to get a

265
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:59,610
foothold so some of yous are going to be

266
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:02,590
configured with a nice abuse of mind

267
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:04,659
your ravenous new dns servers and to be

268
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:06,370
servers a common fundamental

269
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:08,710
infrastructure life along those lines

270
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:10,300
are probably going to use AI things that

271
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:14,530
are fairly easy for the administrators

272
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:16,030
to remember and and configure a lot of

273
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:18,910
this assignments only use the last bite

274
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:22,060
sometimes last two bites so that gives

275
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:24,940
you two date posts berries of the scan

276
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:27,909
to a thousand or fifty six or to the

277
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:31,750
sixteen sixty five times most again both

278
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:34,270
very easy to scan quick examples are

279
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:37,470
rather common router gateways for ipv6

280
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:40,230
so that one : one only 250 for work

281
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:45,539
order now that sense

282
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:49,139
the the last X X number that is becoming

283
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:51,149
a common IP for routers and gateways and

284
00:19:49,139 --> 00:19:53,399
then you've got single left up to

285
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:57,149
coladas depending on how we have been

286
00:19:53,399 --> 00:19:59,279
was feeling for that some of my piece

287
00:19:57,149 --> 00:20:02,760
made that port number so people may

288
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:06,230
assign : 53 to their DNS server using to

289
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:09,779
remember again if people are doing this

290
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:12,779
if you're only checking 1024 below to

291
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:16,519
the 10 that's a thousand host again to

292
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:19,740
the 16 65,000 ports 65,000 post again

293
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:22,980
not very difficult to scan that a very

294
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:33,539
reasonable on that time because I can be

295
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:37,649
six months is hex anybody gets the kind

296
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:40,049
of reference in the corner you can talk

297
00:20:37,649 --> 00:20:42,178
about that later but it essentially uses

298
00:20:40,049 --> 00:20:45,120
a lot of the use of monotony Manik

299
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:48,570
devices to enhance ease of use going

300
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:50,399
some examples of some heck strings feed

301
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:52,439
yard mode whole bunch of stuff you're

302
00:20:50,399 --> 00:20:55,289
good at that I need you better firmware

303
00:20:52,440 --> 00:21:05,220
developments these are common in that

304
00:20:55,289 --> 00:21:09,860
area before in so it's it can can be

305
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:14,429
embedded so they can a few quick details

306
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:16,649
they can take an ipv6 prefix and then

307
00:21:14,429 --> 00:21:19,169
just put your ipv4 addresses at the end

308
00:21:16,649 --> 00:21:20,360
of it this is a quick example of

309
00:21:19,169 --> 00:21:23,870
breaking out

310
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:28,729
one 1716 networked into so you have a

311
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:32,889
prefix that's this to 2001 deviate and

312
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:37,909
then this is the equivalent one 7 to 16

313
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:40,070
1 0 slash 24 and that's kind of and if

314
00:21:37,909 --> 00:21:42,559
repeated twice both the Sun that handing

315
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:45,559
out the address so if they're doing that

316
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:48,950
then that may reduce their ipv4 their

317
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:51,860
effective ipv6 equipment to the same as

318
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:53,720
their ipv4 footprint so if they have a

319
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:56,769
slash 24 well that's a lot of your

320
00:21:53,720 --> 00:22:02,510
addresses to scan 516 is a really big

321
00:21:56,769 --> 00:22:08,029
ipv4 subnet but still manageable address

322
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:11,570
to ever set of scary strategic

323
00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:13,279
randomization so one way to try to cover

324
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:16,549
as much area as possible if you have a

325
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:18,649
large address space you can say ok how

326
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:20,870
many address how many IP addresses can I

327
00:22:18,649 --> 00:22:22,668
see on the amount of time that I so

328
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:24,590
threw together a quick example you can

329
00:22:22,669 --> 00:22:26,029
ask in a million apiece and 24 hours

330
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:30,080
you've got five days to leave Stan

331
00:22:26,029 --> 00:22:32,179
that's five million IDs so you can so

332
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,460
you can compete at n number of random

333
00:22:32,179 --> 00:22:40,549
hosts so you could compute a number of

334
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:44,149
IP addresses with within a / 48 soon to

335
00:22:40,549 --> 00:22:47,510
be 80 or McInnis it's 564 and just start

336
00:22:44,149 --> 00:22:50,110
scanning those you not obviously not

337
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:52,220
everything is going to kind of find but

338
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:54,678
there are some people from the Center

339
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:56,330
for against Internet data analysis they

340
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:59,990
actually found that they could that they

341
00:22:56,330 --> 00:23:03,949
found somewhere between 50 and 30% of

342
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:06,409
the hosts that we're doing and using

343
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:08,330
this this technique so this part is

344
00:23:06,409 --> 00:23:12,409
gaining a foothold this is a good way to

345
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:14,539
go you know if these similar things that

346
00:23:12,409 --> 00:23:17,510
a sub that level so you can break it up

347
00:23:14,539 --> 00:23:19,190
into subnets and hosts and then figure

348
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:23,779
out how many some that you can do and

349
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:25,820
how many hosts per subnet branching out

350
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:28,370
so once you've got a foothold

351
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:31,760
obviously you're probably not able to

352
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:34,189
pull make sure with ipv6 so you use your

353
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,200
Discover most of the seed so we know

354
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:38,179
these hosts exists and then you expand

355
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:40,340
out a simple a simple simple mechanism

356
00:23:38,179 --> 00:23:42,740
for that would be just expanding by some

357
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:45,049
plus/minus range so for every IP that

358
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:47,980
you know is good you scan plus minus 10

359
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:50,510
hosts plus minus 105 ease again

360
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:54,620
important based on what your skin

361
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:57,379
capacity is how quickly can scan what

362
00:23:54,620 --> 00:24:00,020
the time period is using sequence of

363
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:01,460
completion so if you do a trace route

364
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,809
you're going to have different hops

365
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:08,870
along the way so this is a quick example

366
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:13,610
of how a couple hops read a BA and then

367
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:17,658
one is another how well between D and B

368
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:22,070
a B 1 you've got these these four hex

369
00:24:17,659 --> 00:24:23,990
addresses so if you can say well we know

370
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:25,399
things this we know things that there's

371
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:27,529
a pretty good chance but there's some

372
00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:31,699
addresses in the middle that are also

373
00:24:27,529 --> 00:24:35,330
use so you can flag those as as subnets

374
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:39,340
to scan work more deeply or host

375
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:39,340
for a little bit more explicitly

376
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:47,658
continue to branch out

377
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:52,369
so autumn assignment schemes ipv6 has a

378
00:24:47,659 --> 00:24:54,440
built in IP address assignment the

379
00:24:52,369 --> 00:24:56,899
default mechanism is stateless auto

380
00:24:54,440 --> 00:25:00,289
address configuration essentially using

381
00:24:56,899 --> 00:25:02,439
invented I Triple E IVs we often think

382
00:25:00,289 --> 00:25:06,710
of business MAC addresses which is

383
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:07,879
generally often true there's a little

384
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:13,480
bit more behind it but we don't need to

385
00:25:07,879 --> 00:25:18,019
get into those details the default is to

386
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:22,070
take the 60 to build 64 bits of address

387
00:25:18,019 --> 00:25:24,799
space first 24 are based on the UI which

388
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:29,418
is the max assignment that was made to

389
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:34,460
the vendor the next 16 bits are fixed in

390
00:25:29,419 --> 00:25:36,799
the FFT pattern then the next 24 bits

391
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:38,389
are the low 24 bits of the MAC address

392
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:43,279
so the least significant bits of an

393
00:25:38,389 --> 00:25:45,769
address so if you have a subnet you know

394
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:49,159
this is a good subnet you know you're

395
00:25:45,769 --> 00:25:51,679
using I Triple E IDs and you know Oh

396
00:25:49,159 --> 00:25:54,799
they've got a whole bunch of machines

397
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:57,379
from yes a certain vendor you know what

398
00:25:54,799 --> 00:26:00,080
that vendors are you is then that gives

399
00:25:57,379 --> 00:26:02,449
you to the 24 hosts at most maybe to

400
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:05,418
23rd depending on some some technical

401
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:09,350
issues if you want to know what the

402
00:26:05,419 --> 00:26:10,760
units are I Triple E has all of those

403
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:16,580
because those are all eight applications

404
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:18,379
- most importantly - I Triple E often

405
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:20,750
the lower 24 bits are not random

406
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:24,080
machines are bought in batches deployed

407
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:27,020
geographically etc although ice machine

408
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,820
change-out break get replaced that

409
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:31,210
correlation does does reduce somewhat

410
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,210
over time

411
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:38,600
virtualization so just like with

412
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:41,120
physical hardware there are MAC

413
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:44,840
addresses that are signed to the virtual

414
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:47,719
systems via whereas as a few matters

415
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:56,149
in particular if there's an automatic

416
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:59,570
back assignment from ESX and you happen

417
00:26:56,150 --> 00:27:03,110
to know the IP of any OS X Server you

418
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:07,330
can reduce the your scan for virtual

419
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:10,129
machines on that host to do today so 256

420
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:14,059
potential hosts on that on that

421
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:17,390
particular via BM host there's MAC

422
00:27:14,059 --> 00:27:19,850
address main Commack assignments again

423
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:23,179
displaying a different UI and then a

424
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:26,049
reduced range of the last 24 bits for

425
00:27:23,179 --> 00:27:27,830
some compatibility reasons with vmware

426
00:27:26,049 --> 00:27:33,440
don't need to go through all these

427
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:36,918
doctor has a base of the tier 2 home 42

428
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:39,100
plus the v4 address epochs can override

429
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:41,799
that and assign them manually but then

430
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:45,279
doesn't do a duplicate back check for

431
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:48,730
manually contributor max so most of the

432
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:50,799
time you're looking at a two to three to

433
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:54,309
two to three to number of IP used to

434
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:58,149
scan with with dr. another place to keep

435
00:27:54,309 --> 00:28:02,168
amenities obviously as well there are

436
00:27:58,149 --> 00:28:04,239
privacy extensions for ipv6 slack which

437
00:28:02,169 --> 00:28:05,889
is becoming more and more common

438
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,200
this is of this this will become less

439
00:28:05,889 --> 00:28:10,330
useful over time but for now it's

440
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:12,429
something worth keeping in mind in terms

441
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:17,158
of informing your scans and being more

442
00:28:12,429 --> 00:28:19,299
effective DHCP anybody that's using DHCP

443
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:22,629
admins probably gonna choose a narrow

444
00:28:19,299 --> 00:28:25,299
range of IPs

445
00:28:22,629 --> 00:28:27,428
per DCP some servers still assign them

446
00:28:25,299 --> 00:28:34,210
sequentially so that can that can be a

447
00:28:27,429 --> 00:28:36,490
benefit takeaways so expand that maybe

448
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:38,950
600 space has some opportunities for

449
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:41,980
both defenders it's a little easier to

450
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:43,389
hide also for attackers full visibility

451
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:45,730
about the mistakes probably as if

452
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:48,250
they're some human and technical factors

453
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:50,980
that mean these six addresses are often

454
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:53,139
are at random some knowledge in the

455
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:55,120
network topology it becomes more

456
00:28:53,139 --> 00:28:57,908
important for a reasonably host

457
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:00,309
discovery 86 research and reconnaissance

458
00:28:57,909 --> 00:29:02,039
also becomes more important and the

459
00:29:00,309 --> 00:29:04,360
ability to combine data from multiple

460
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:06,470
tools so combining data from your

461
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:10,418
research and your reconnaissance from

462
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:13,519
network topology becomes more important

463
00:29:10,419 --> 00:29:16,370
and however developing this capability

464
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:18,080
these capabilities also will benefit

465
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:24,580
other capabilities within the

466
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:50,658
organization I think even the science

467
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:53,720
and any questions so question was do you

468
00:29:50,659 --> 00:29:55,909
think that the DDoS attacks over ipv6

469
00:29:53,720 --> 00:30:00,220
are going to go away because of they've

470
00:29:55,909 --> 00:30:06,259
reduced ability to scan at high rates I

471
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:08,210
suspect probably not and all you need is

472
00:30:06,259 --> 00:30:11,179
one good scan to know what booths are

473
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:12,740
there and to some extent all you need to

474
00:30:11,179 --> 00:30:16,100
know is what the routers IP is so you

475
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:17,809
can find that via via trace route so if

476
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:20,840
you can swap if you can swap their

477
00:30:17,809 --> 00:30:22,850
circuit then the DDoS is still effective

478
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:26,449
even if it's not necessarily targeting a

479
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:28,908
single host there may be some change

480
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:31,399
although the larger address space also

481
00:30:28,909 --> 00:30:34,429
needs larger packets so your

482
00:30:31,399 --> 00:30:37,689
amplification factor may have this small

483
00:30:34,429 --> 00:30:37,690
bump to it

484
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:51,000
the so that the idea ranges I you know

485
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:54,059
used here are are actually reserve

486
00:30:51,000 --> 00:31:05,450
ranges for documentation for for

487
00:30:54,059 --> 00:31:05,450
examples but yeah okay
