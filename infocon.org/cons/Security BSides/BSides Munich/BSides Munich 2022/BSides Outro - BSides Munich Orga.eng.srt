every year things grow things evolve

sometimes there are endings and

61
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,560
sometimes there are new beginnings but

62
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,800
one thing we should know is that every

63
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,519
end is basically a new beginning

64
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,319
and today we would like to ask you for

65
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,040
