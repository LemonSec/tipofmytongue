1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,600
yeah thank you very much for the nice

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,759
introduction um

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,440
and also for the besides munich

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,679
how you called organizers to invite me

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,560
to give this keynote

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,039
so when they asked me about can you give

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,960
the keynote i was asking myself what

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,400
should i talk about

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,160
it's always always the same thing what

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,400
do you want to do and for me when i was

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,320
young and listen to keynotes and still

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,000
doing listening to keynotes i always

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,320
think how should a keynote look like it

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,160
should be inspiring it should be giving

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,120
a new sword so the first obvious choice

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,920
was

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,840
let's talk about cyber but i hate this

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,760
red cyber so here's the

19
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,160
normal slide deck about all the cyber

20
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,239
buzzwords around there and i will not

21
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:47,920
talk anymore about cyber

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,399
so you have set one so the next

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,920
topic which came to mind let's talk

24
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,760
about blockchain because i don't know

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,079
how you how you are doing but

26
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,640
i get a lot with this password so every

27
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,960
manager coming to me every company let's

28
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,719
do something about blockchain blockchain

29
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,720
blockchain blockchain i can't hear it

30
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,880
anymore so here's the obvious slide deck

31
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,880
slide about blockchain i will not talk

32
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,479
anymore about that

33
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:11,280
so

34
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,640
then we had a

35
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,159
really good talk with the business

36
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,479
organizat organizers um

37
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,880
and we discussed about

38
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,840
what can give back to the community

39
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,360
so

40
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,320
i i grew up in a large organization you

41
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,360
know

42
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,000
sometimes very bureaucratic organization

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,960
and

44
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,280
every time i went there i was like okay

45
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,119
this is really the way

46
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,119
people are doing that

47
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,439
so i learned a lot when i joined

48
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,799
communities

49
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,560
as the introduction was saying

50
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,159
communities are so important you learn

51
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,360
things and you get new in

52
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,040
inspiration and so on and therefore we

53
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,479
said okay

54
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,159
let's talk about communities so why

55
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,560
can't i talk about communities so i

56
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,280
joined very young with a community

57
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,240
and

58
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,360
i was there as a yeah newbie

59
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,119
first time attendee

60
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,280
however you get called

61
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,080
and then i was at this large

62
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,758
organization called form of incident

63
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,440
response and security teams which is the

64
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,360
largest organization for security teams

65
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,280
in the world i was there on the board of

66
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,800
directors for six years and were the

67
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,239
chairman for that

68
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,160
and believe me or not

69
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,200
it's

70
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,440
it sounds great but it's a lot of work

71
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,920
so i know what the besides people are

72
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,840
doing in their volunteer time i had

73
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,520
professional staff

74
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,800
around so

75
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,800
i want to use this opportunity now that

76
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,720
you give them all and not only the

77
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,319
volunteers because they have forgot

78
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,720
about thanking the whole organization

79
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,800
team of a lot of our plows because what

80
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,080

81
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,080
doing all that for you so please give a

82
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,360
lot of uploads to them now

83
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,400
so i want to share the experience i had

84
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,159
with communities building up communities

85
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,440
running communities learning from my

86
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,200
communities and so on

87
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,560
so this is also a bit of a personal talk

88
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,480
so when i was finishing university i was

89
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,440
i thought i know everything

90
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,519
and i learned the total difference when

91
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,599
i joined the first organization first

92
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,560
company

93
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,040
and i was very overwhelmed i learned new

94
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,720
passwords every day

95
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,560
and i was like oh god

96
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,440
university have not prepared me for that

97
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,480
job

98
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,120
and what did i do wrong with with what i

99
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,560
learned and so on so i was really i was

100
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,040
really sometimes a bit nervous if if i'm

101
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,400
as an engineer doing the right thing

102
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,680
and

103
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,920
back then when i started we had not had

104
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,959
this company cultures where it was still

105
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,599
hierarchy driven and so on so i looked

106
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,680
at the topics what what we're doing on a

107
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,040
daily business

108
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,120
and i always thought is it really how

109
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,120
this work is it not really boring is

110
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,280
that not a lot of problems and on so i

111
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,799
had a lot of questions every day and all

112
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,560
these questions were not really answered

113
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,799
by my teammates because

114
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,120
those were the ones were doing that all

115
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,120
the time the same thing so i said

116
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,120
question not what they were doing

117
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,920
so i felt really alone i felt alone with

118
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,280
my questions

119
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,798
i was like there

120
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,560
am i in the right place am i doing

121
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,560
something wrong and so on so the

122
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,639
question came to me

123
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,680
is there anybody out there who has the

124
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,759
same problems i do who has the same

125
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,560
perspective on topic than i do

126
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,000
and

127
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,280
that was

128
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,440
for a large i think over over one year a

129
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,400
huge topic i thought about i i

130
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,840
questioned myself and so on

131
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,919
is there anybody out there by the way

132
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,479
which band

133
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,120
no one

134
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,400
i think floyd right so my favorite band

135
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,120
so it was obvious choice

136
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,880
so is there anybody out there and i can

137
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,880
tell you yes there are there are a lot

138
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,400
of people out there you see it here in

139
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,600
the community there are a lot of people

140
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,199
out there and there are a lot of people

141
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,280
out there in in the whole

142
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,000
in the whole uh industry we have who are

143
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,479
doing work who do volunteer work who

144
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,800
share experience on their own but you

145
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,560
need to find that

146
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,880
you need to engage with them and what i

147
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,440
want to do today is to discuss with you

148
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,320
about

149
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,440
my experience i had when i joined those

150
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,720
communities

151
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,320
learned grew failed

152
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,440
and

153
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,120
in the end where i was able to run off

154
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,199
one of those communities and spend a lot

155
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,880
of time in there

156
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,960
and it's a it was a great experience

157
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,720
it's still a great experience and i want

158
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,840
to give you

159
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,000
i hope that you when you go out of this

160
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,440
office talk today that you yeah have

161
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,960
ideas about

162
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,160
what what may you what you can do

163
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,039
also to give back the knowledge you have

164
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,039
so how's this talk structured today i

165
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,120
have three important topics which i want

166
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,800
to cover the first is what is this about

167
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,199
so what is about communities what you

168
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,280
really should learn from communities and

169
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,080
so on the next one is what you need to

170
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,280
do

171
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,319
so how can you give back what you

172
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,960
experience what you learned and so on

173
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,639
and last but not least what you gain

174
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,759
so what you can get out if you do that

175
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,560
if you do it and on so let's start about

176
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,639
what this is about

177
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,720
so who of you

178
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,080
are part of a community

179
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,800
so who so the people who not still

180
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,919
have her hands erased uh who are part of

181
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,919
the community so

182
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,759
who thinks that's a lot of work being in

183
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,319
a community

184
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,199
okay that's interesting i have a totally

185
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,039
different perspective on that

186
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,000
so

187
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,680
when i talk about communities what do i

188
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,479
mean

189
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:55,280
so

190
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,280
i'm there are a lot of communities out

191
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,599
there there are these super exclusive

192
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,120
globs where companies pay

193
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,000
five uh five number uh membership fees

194
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,120
annually

195
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,560
and then there are the more

196
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,120
industrial-driven organizations who are

197
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,919
based on volunteers and then there are

198
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,759
yeah communities like b-sides or others

199
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,160
who are totally volunteer-driven like

200
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,360
yeah b-sides over and so on

201
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,240
so we have a very

202
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,520
we have a lot of different people like

203
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,520
the isaacs who get a lot of money every

204
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,520
year they have professional staff

205
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,520
working on topics and you have those

206
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,919
larger communities which which get money

207
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,360
from sponsors and someone running it and

208
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,039
then you have the total volunteer driven

209
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,560
ones and i can tell you one thing in all

210
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,960
those communities there's one

211
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,840
thing which is common it's all about the

212
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,840
people who are engaged with that

213
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,000
so if it's as if even they have a lot of

214
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,960
money

215
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,120
they are in the background people who

216
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,560
really think this is the thing which we

217
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,360
need to drive it's important for me so

218
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,039
they spend their whole spare time in

219
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,800
this community building it up and so on

220
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,440
and that's always the same thing

221
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,240
but why do you do that

222
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,319
so the first thing why are doing that is

223
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,199
learning

224
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,000
so

225
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,280
for me when i joined after this one year

226
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,280
thanks to a former manager of mine one

227
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,800
of those communities

228
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,520
i came there for five days and i can

229
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,080
tell you i went back home and i was

230
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,599
totally

231
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,639
uh full of sugar and totally overengaged

232
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,559
and so on because i gained so much

233
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,559
knowledge during that week and that's

234
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,479
mostly because the nice thing about this

235
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:37,760
community is

236
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,000
there are people there who are in the

237
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
industry for way longer

238
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,200
and who are willing to share what

239
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,959
what um

240
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,519
what say experience what say faults so i

241
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,680
grew up in the cser community and the

242
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,120
nice thing about the caesar community is

243
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,640
they are always in the background so

244
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,720
caesar people literally don't talk about

245
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,560
in the public how cool they are they are

246
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,200
not in not on on stages doing huge

247
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,440
keynotes they are in the background and

248
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,680
securing our network our internet and so

249
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,080
on and when i went there there were all

250
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,760
those people who were in the business

251
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,399
for 30 years 20 years and when i talked

252
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,480
with them and showed them i'm really

253
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,320
happy to learn from them

254
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,600
they gave back

255
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,920
all the knowledge they have to me

256
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,480
and i was lucky that two of them which i

257
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,560
call now friends

258
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,200
took that opportunity up and and helped

259
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,800
me support me to grow where i'm i am now

260
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,120
but it's not always

261
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,040
one way it's not always that the

262
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,519
orders give back to the younger what i

263
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,800
learned is that as a young engineer

264
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,800
i question topics and questions hey is

265
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,760
that the correct way doing so

266
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,080
is it really what we did as a best

267
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,760
practice for 20 years

268
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,080
something which should be done like that

269
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,640
isn't there new technology out new new

270
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,080
thinking and

271
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,800
in our society where we need to adapt

272
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,560
our brushes and

273
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,040
exp a good experienced person in our

274
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,760
community is seeing this potential that

275
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,720
people are questioning and hearing

276
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,399
and not just saying no no no we have

277
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,720
done that for 20 years we know that's

278
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,000
working

279
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,320
and that's the wrong attitude to to

280
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,800
tackle topics you need to listen to the

281
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,680
people

282
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,839
understand what you if it if that's

283
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,360
maybe something that you're doing for 20

284
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,000
years or wrong and accept that you may

285
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,600
be wrong

286
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,800
so the

287
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,440
former team i was running it was always

288
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,440
important for me that i listened to what

289
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,920
they are doing what what say

290
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,399
what they what the experience they have

291
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,720
and so on and for example when i was

292
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,240
doing programming

293
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,000
i was really bad in that

294
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,760
and there is one person here so here in

295
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,480
the audience who need who i think hated

296
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,440
to uh read my code overflow

297
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,800
so

298
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,680
and for me it was important that i i was

299
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,519
i was not telling him i'm the older one

300
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,600
i know what i'm doing that i listened to

301
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,880
him and said okay you're better than

302
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,720
that so please do so

303
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,920
so learning is not always about one way

304
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,839
always giving the experience to younger

305
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,839
it's all the other way that all the

306
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,200
older people are listening to the

307
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,279
younger people understanding hey maybe

308
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,519
they are right or they're not or we are

309
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,360
wrong we should change

310
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,640
what we are doing so that's an important

311
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,120
very important question

312
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,920
and i choose this picture by purpose

313
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,360
because

314
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,839
in our global society and especially

315
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,160
what we are doing on the internet

316
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,240
we also need to listen to other cultures

317
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,600
what i've experienced in some

318
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,519
communities is when there are people

319
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,000
from other cultures since investing

320
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,720
in the western culture approaching you

321
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,279
they always say okay yeah

322
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,120
what do you talk about in africa i don't

323
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,800
care what you're doing africa and this

324
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,880
is also which we need to so uh yeah we

325
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,320
need to improve because

326
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,800
our cultures are so important technology

327
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,720
decisions which we are doing so it's not

328
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,560
only learning

329
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,720
between us it's learning listening to

330
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,880
other cultures our societies and so on

331
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,480
and with all the crisis we are very

332
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,839
highly seeing that's getting more and

333
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,839
more important

334
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,920
so the next thing it's not about it's

335
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,920
not only about sharing

336
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,959
so

337
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,600
for example the organization uh i uh i

338
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,000
was on the board first it was known for

339
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,519
the huge conference so they had an

340
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,279
annual huge conference people around the

341
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,519
world came there but it was mostly only

342
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,360
known for this conference and i hated

343
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,160
that

344
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,720
because there are these c-shirts around

345
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,200
there who really want to engage in on a

346
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,959
daily on a daily business of working

347
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,040
each other so if there's an attack on

348
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,320
going

349
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,440
there are structures in in blaze where

350
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,519
ceasers can communicate to each other

351
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,120
say hey we have this problem can you

352
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,240
step in

353
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,639
so i don't know who if you are isn't are

354
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,959
in the response but in zero response is

355
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,800
not tied to one organization it's most

356
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,360
of the time or uh yeah

357
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,160
a community which needs to work on that

358
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,639
so this is so keen that

359
00:12:58,639 --> 00:12:59,519
you

360
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,240
have ways in place when you need to work

361
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,320
with each other that you say hey i have

362
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,680
a problem and then you step in and

363
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,920
support those people

364
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,680
if you go through management for example

365
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,920
so i had some times when you do my

366
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,680
report to my manager and my managers

367
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,200
that tend to the next manager can we

368
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,839
talk to this company it takes ages and

369
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,600
when lawyers are involved then it takes

370
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,880
forever

371
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,800
so direct connections to each other are

372
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,040
so important so building up a network in

373
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,120
the community is so keen

374
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,200
so you should not only go there and say

375
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,360
great i will sit here

376
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,279
and listen

377
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,200
and then i go home you should be in

378
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,079
there

379
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,160
go out talk with the speakers talk with

380
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,040
others build up a network because this

381
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,279
network is so keen on daily operations

382
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,800
and it's not only being there at a

383
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,880
conference it's also doing the

384
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,560
conferences joining a mailing list

385
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,839
give talks somewhere so it's it's keen

386
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,079
because when you have this fire fighting

387
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,199
happening

388
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:58,480
you need to

389
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,680
use this

390
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,120
this network

391
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,120
and help each other

392
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,120
and there are various communities out

393
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,720
there

394
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,880
where you can do that but they're also

395
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,240
something which is called trusted

396
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,320
communities trusted groups

397
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,839
and those people

398
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:14,720
are

399
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,480
those communities are

400
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,279
sometimes called fight club so there are

401
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,959
fight club rules i am not really huge

402
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,480
fan of this fight lab

403
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,959
rules but there are communities who are

404
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,720
individuals these individuals share

405
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,639
their knowledge share their operational

406
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,880
work sometimes when i open my email box

407
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,880
and i'm seeing what the text i'm going

408
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,880
in this main list i was like wow who

409
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,560
should how should i process that all

410
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,560
this information we have

411
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,480
so

412
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,399
you see this is ongoing this is

413
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,560
something which is helping each other is

414
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,079
so important

415
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,680
so this is what

416
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,959
you are able what is this about learning

417
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,480
from each other

418
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,160
sharing the knowledge

419
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,320
supporting each other when there are

420
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,040
things happening but

421
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,279
as i said before

422
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,360
you also need to think about okay how

423
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,519
this community is working

424
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:06,480
so

425
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,880
you come here you listen to talks you

426
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,560
already learned that there are your

427
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,760
volunteers

428
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,160
who supp who are organizing all of that

429
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,600
there are sponsors who are paying the

430
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,120
money says that we can be here at a

431
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,839
conference hotel and so on

432
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,440
but imagine

433
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,120
if there would be no volunteers doing

434
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,440
that no sponsors and no speakers and so

435
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,600
on nothing would happen

436
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,040
so you would

437
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,639
instead of going to munich and

438
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,560
talk to each other you would need to go

439
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,480
to the office or her home office

440
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,399
and do your work so

441
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,120
only because of volunteers this is uh

442
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,959
this is possible

443
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,119
so

444
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,920
what can you do that this

445
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,959
can be

446
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,519
improved the situation we have

447
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,440
yeah first of all share your experience

448
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,680
so i think all of you have on a daily

449
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,680
basis

450
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,639
yeah

451
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,480
something is happening in your office

452
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,160
you build a tool

453
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,480
you had an incident or you had a good

454
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,600
hack

455
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,680
but you never want to talk about because

456
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,160
as for example with me i always said for

457
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,759
example oh

458
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,160
i was really doing a bad job there so i

459
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,680
should not talk about it

460
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,079
or oh i don't have the time to prepare

461
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,600
talk

462
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,480
or whatever you find as an external uh

463
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,040
as an rule that you don't do it

464
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,720
and that's wrong

465
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,800
so first of all what i learned is

466
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,720
talking about failure is often more

467
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,560
important than showing off

468
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,240
so i'm for example now back in the

469
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,320
academic field and i can tell you one of

470
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,600
the worst things about the academic

471
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,079
field is that you only share great great

472
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,360
uh

473
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,680
great papers in big conferences and then

474
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,959
you gain

475
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,600
again another

476
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,600
point that you're good talking about

477
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,440
something but for example in the

478
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,279
academic field we don't talk about

479
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,199
failures even

480
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,440
if there should be those talks

481
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,199
the industry is a bit better here but

482
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,599
not as it could be

483
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,959
so

484
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,799
talking about failure especially in our

485
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,880
field is so important because everyone

486
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,039
can learn and leverage from that

487
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,359
next when you work on something and you

488
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,599
think okay i don't i'm not really sure

489
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,679
should i publish that or not

490
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:20,640
do it

491
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,240
i don't know how your company policies

492
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,760
are and so on but put it on github

493
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,720
and share it on twitter talk about it

494
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,799
that's very important give go to a

495
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,320
conference talk about it then you get

496
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,880
feedback and maybe find people involved

497
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,160
in that

498
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,679
i have seen so many cool projects

499
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,240
dying on a laptop's hard disk because

500
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,880
people have not wanted to share it so

501
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,480
for example my students when they come

502
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,360
to me to do write their final thesis i

503
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,400
always say i don't want to have this

504
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,760
source code on a on a usb stick or on a

505
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,039
cd

506
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,720
and not kidding still on cd sometimes

507
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,640
put it on github

508
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,520
tweet about it because it's maybe no one

509
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,280
is interested in but maybe there are

510
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,280
then you said then you build up your

511
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,960
profile

512
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,799
so

513
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,559
what i want to encourage you is that

514
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,320
everyone who is here now in the audience

515
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,400
will submit the talk to next next year's

516
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,080
besides

517
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,240
even your manual can be selected

518
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,280
[Applause]

519
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,360
if you not get selected

520
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,960
it's an experience you have you get

521
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,039
feedback and so on

522
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,640
so that's important share your

523
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,799
experience then

524
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,520
help others

525
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,880
so

526
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,520
you are here because you want to learn

527
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,960
something

528
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,320
but it's not only about learning it's

529
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,640
also that we as people are very complex

530
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,640
we may have our personal problems and so

531
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,600
on

532
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,919
and that's so keen in a community when

533
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,080
you have a smaller community you build

534
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,000
up friendship

535
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,240
and therefore it's important that you

536
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,559
listen to others maybe they

537
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:03,360
say

538
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,440
ask for help you don't understand that

539
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,039
they're asking for help

540
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,360
so you need to listen to them carefully

541
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,799
understanding what's the problems they

542
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,360
have and then they

543
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,320
help

544
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,440
help them

545
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,120
and this is something which i

546
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,200
experienced quite often

547
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,080
so i had personal problems i had

548
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,160
problems in the shop and so on and i

549
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,960
have always people i can ask

550
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,760
outside of the outside of my company uh

551
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,320
within my company and so on

552
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,320
and this important thing what i wanted

553
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,520
to give

554
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,160
or what i want to share with you is

555
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,880
first of all if you need help if you

556
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,320
have a complex problem for example

557
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,080
learning to solve you should not be

558
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,880
alone just ask just experience people or

559
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,960
people you trust and tell them hey i

560
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,120
have this problem can you help me

561
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,960
or if you have personal problems because

562
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,640
you don't really know how your career

563
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,480
path is ongoing there are a lot of

564
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,160
communities outside supporting you on

565
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,080
that so ask for

566
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,280
help

567
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,679
and more important be there if someone

568
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,600
is asking for help

569
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,720
so

570
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,159
talk to them

571
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,200
and and use this time i know we are in

572
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,919
this industry we are all stressed out

573
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,919
and we're doing a lot of work on a daily

574
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,520
basis and then you oh and now it's 9 00

575
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,440
pm and i still need to talk with this

576
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,520
one guy because he is asking for help

577
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,240
and that's the total wrong

578
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,120
the total wrong attitude to it it's

579
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,360
something when you help someone you may

580
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,440
later on when you need help this person

581
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,840
may help you as well and i can tell you

582
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,600
i i was at that situation quite often

583
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,760
and and it was always very important for

584
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,720
me that i had someone to talk a talk

585
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,840
so

586
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,640
now to the last point now i told you

587
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,039
about what's all about these communities

588
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,960
i talked about what you need to do or

589
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,960
what you should do and so on

590
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,559
but what do you regain from that

591
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,480
so first of all knowledge

592
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,679
and as you know knowledge is keen

593
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,840
in our society it's

594
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,919
very important

595
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,080
that you that you gain this knowledge

596
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,919
and

597
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,080
for i can tell you from my experience

598
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,159
that's the most what you get from a

599
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,039
community is exactly that knowledge

600
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:21,840
so

601
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,720
what's what what kind of knowledge so i

602
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,159
can give you now some examples um so

603
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,280
i was working on a on something within

604
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,520
my former company so i said we were able

605
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,720
to detect

606
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,880
some uh attacks

607
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,120
and i had a problem with

608
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,880
privacy so the way i wanted to do it was

609
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,360
on from a private perspective wrong

610
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,280
and i knew that but privacy is important

611
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,760
for all of us so i was really there for

612
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,760
three months i have not found any

613
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,039
solution

614
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,120
so i went to a conference and discussed

615
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,799
it with a friendly circle as it's a

616
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,520
luxembourg c-3 and i talked to alexandre

617
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,240
i had this problem and just told him

618
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,919
what what problem i have

619
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,520
and he looked at me oh that's quite easy

620
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,679
just use that in that europe

621
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,120
and that is the data structure and and

622
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,880
everything is solved

623
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,960
i was like wow this was a very easy

624
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,880
answer so i went back home

625
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,600
implemented that and it worked

626
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,720
and

627
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,799
yeah this knowledge that helped me on a

628
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,360
daily basis and that's just one example

629
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,760
another example is

630
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,080
when i was when i

631
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,760
became manager

632
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,360
i never really were a good people

633
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,039
manager

634
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,799
and some of the audience can't tell

635
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,320
about that

636
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,360
so

637
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,280
i didn't want to discuss it internally

638
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,280
and also the team i

639
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,039
yeah i was in there was totally

640
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,559
different to other teams so i couldn't

641
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,320
really ask for help within the

642
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,679
organization

643
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:50,720
so

644
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,799
i went out there and discussed with

645
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,640
others who were running successfully

646
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,960
teams like mine and said okay what are

647
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,360
you doing what you how how how do you

648
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,120
solve that in that problem

649
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,440
or how you tackle that

650
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,240
and so and they gave me wonderful ideas

651
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,200
about

652
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,640
what you can do and that's also

653
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,159
knowledge it's not only about technical

654
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,120
knowledge it's also about how you yeah

655
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,799
manage people how you

656
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,679
how you grew your people and so on

657
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,159
and last but not least

658
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,440
building up friends so for example my

659
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,640
best friend

660
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,520
i

661
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,960
i met

662
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,840
uh at a conference or first of all i met

663
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,600
him with on a mailing list and i thought

664
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,440
who is this who is this person who is

665
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,679
asking so stupid questions

666
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,000
but being biased

667
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,240
and now he's my best friend because we

668
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,120
found out that hey we have the same

669
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,360
we have the same technical interest job

670
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,440
interest but also private interest

671
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,480
and i can tell you for sure that

672
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,200
all of us are bit same not only

673
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,799
only in the industry but also in our

674
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,279
private sphere so you gain

675
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:58,640
friends and like

676
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,960
i i must say

677
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,559
when i

678
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,480
when i look into my friendship most of

679
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,400
those people are

680
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,600
within

681
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,159
my community so these are the people i

682
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:11,600
trust a lot

683
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,240
i i talk on a daily basis and even i

684
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,840
have private problems

685
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,760
i have them because

686
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,600
they knew me they know how i'm working

687
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,840
and so on so this is what you also gain

688
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,720
a lot of friends which you can use

689
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,279
the whole career path and later on

690
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,840
hopefully also when you retire you can

691
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,400
do nice trips with them and so on so

692
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,240
that's also important that you just

693
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,000
don't just look at the

694
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,320
look at hey this is just a job

695
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,960
because our job takes the majority of

696
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,200
the time we have on a week

697
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,880
so you should share that with friends

698
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,039
and not with with people who you're just

699
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,080
in there for eight hours on a day

700
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,240
so this is what i want to talk with or

701
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,159
talk about um

702
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,960
what i learned why for me communities

703
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,200
are important and so on

704
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,279
and i hope you get

705
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,840
you under yeah you gain something out of

706
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,440
this talk that you learned about

707
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,640
something

708
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,919
and that you

709
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,320
submitted a talk next year

710
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,159
thank you very much i hope you enjoyed

711
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,159
it

712
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,919
does anybody have a question for

713
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:29,200
homeless

714
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,679
it's a great opportunity

715
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:46,849
[Music]

716
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,840
uh so first of all uh thank you for your

717
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,720
talk

718
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,600
uh when you mentioned uh we should talk

719
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,080
more about failure uh it reminds me of

720
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,559
something that i read i think in uh

721
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:09,440
this book from uh

722
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,000
i think it's called it uh and fragile

723
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,520
but basically the guy makes this

724
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,600
argument that we have this a big

725
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,240
graveyard of failure behind us so when

726
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,960
you see like say book authors we have

727
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,559
like someone that release a book and we

728
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,640
have like i don't know 10 000 people

729
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,440
that never released a book but tried to

730
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,960
publish something

731
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,760
could you please discuss a bit more how

732
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,520
would you approach that how could we

733
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,360
discuss more failure

734
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,158
give maybe some ideas

735
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,240
so you you can approach it on on various

736
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,159
levels i think there is a conference

737
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,679
format out

738
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:47,919
i can't be called the name where you

739
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,000
just talk about failures

740
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,840
uh i think that's one approach the

741
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,840
second approach is within organization

742
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,080
you what you can talk is that you do

743
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,640
what you can do is on a weekly basis on

744
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,279
monthly basis you have uh an evening

745
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,679
where where you're only allowed to share

746
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,120
failures you did

747
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,799
and then on a daily on a daily job basis

748
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:09,919
uh

749
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,600
you may do a

750
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,919
instead of doing a scrum or dailies and

751
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,240
then you also talk about in the dailies

752
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,720
about what did what did not work and how

753
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,279
you solve that so you need to facilitate

754
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:24,799
a culture where you discuss it

755
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,440
and way more important is that from a

756
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,399
mindset you need to allow your allow

757
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,600
failures so it's quite often that people

758
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,960
think okay if it if i fail

759
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,720
i'm doing a bad job

760
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,760
it's quite obvious

761
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,600
it's quite the obvious it's

762
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,480
um

763
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,120
opposite sorry obvious the opposite it's

764
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,880
you need to understand hey when i'm

765
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,640
doing a fail it's totally fine that it's

766
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,279
his failure and now i need to understand

767
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,279
during lessons learned about what i what

768
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,480
i did wrong

769
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,799
and honestly when i so i have a small

770
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,159
child at home

771
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:03,279
and she is doing the whole day failures

772
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,360
i can shout at her

773
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,159
and say you're doing it wrong or can i

774
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,399
can just show her why she did it wrong

775
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,720
and that's like a mindset chef we need

776
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,120
to we need to do and i can tell you our

777
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,279
society unfortunately still doesn't

778
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,039
allow failures

779
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,120
so starting

780
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,880
to change in our society that failure is

781
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,320
allowed is the first thing which is

782
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,520
important to do

783
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,080
but a great question

784
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,240
okay thank you very much and enjoy the

785
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,640
rest of the day
