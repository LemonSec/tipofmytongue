1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,920
well thank you for an introduction so as

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,520
the name implies here this is going to

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,920
be about uh how to secure cloud-based

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,519
product developments

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,200
but before we start maybe a few words

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,799
about myself so i've been working in

7
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,880
software industry for a few years now i

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,320
started out as a software engineer

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,720
originally but then transitioned over

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,800
into a security role

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,000
and

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,519
i'm currently working with a security

13
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,599
engineer securing an as a service

14
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,359
platform which is currently running onto

15
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,199
cloud-based platforms

16
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,280
and this talk is a kind of a summary of

17
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,280
the things i've learned over the years

18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,880
both in my current job but also in my

19
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,399
previous shopping i've seen quite a lot

20
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,200
of different cloud-based products

21
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,920
okay so imagine you're a security

22
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,840
engineer and you're starting a new job

23
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,239
right today

24
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,000
you're working for the startup called

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,800
acme and you've hired specifically to

26
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,960
build up their cloud security program

27
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,640
that means you're the first person who

28
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,079
really thinks about security from a

29
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,840
holistic perspective and hopefully who

30
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,520
knows what you're supposed or what they

31
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,520
are supposed to be doing

32
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,879
and when we are talking about product

33
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,560
well their product is what you seize

34
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,159
very often these days

35
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,760
on the one hand it's an asset service

36
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,760
offering can be platform as a service or

37
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,439
software as a service

38
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,960
it's running on those

39
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,479
usually well-known cloud provider

40
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,240
platforms

41
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,840
and their technology stack is or

42
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,520
something you see very often these days

43
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,360
so the applications are packaged into

44
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,439
containers the containers are being

45
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,520
deployed and executed by kubernetes and

46
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,280
you have some additional cloud service

47
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,720
around it that you need

48
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,640
for compute instances for storage

49
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,799
services and so on

50
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,400
so this is another thing to do let's see

51
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,479
unusual that you can see in cloud space

52
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,759
these days

53
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,600
so the question is

54
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,520
where do you start right security is a

55
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,079
huge topic and you can't do everything

56
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,840
on day one you have to somehow

57
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,399
prioritize and think about what can you

58
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:51,680
do the beginning and what can you do

59
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,560
later

60
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,920
that means in the beginning we want to

61
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,759
go for some easy wins right things which

62
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,159
are so called low hanging fruits but at

63
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,240
the same time have a high secured impact

64
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,240
in terms of improving the security

65
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,240
posture of the products

66
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,840
so how can we do that and that's

67
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,280
basically what this talk is about how

68
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,520
can we define a security roadmap that

69
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,560
somehow starts in a relatively easy way

70
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,000
and that scales up over time

71
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,160
so security activities that i'm going to

72
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,520
present on the next slide are grouped

73
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,680
into different phases first one is like

74
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,760
the absolute basics that really everyone

75
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,840
should start with and then starting from

76
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,120
phase two we are going to have more

77
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,720
topics that might only pay off in the

78
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,480
medium term

79
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,160
whether something should be in phase two

80
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,239
or three or four is a little bit let's

81
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,120
say it's always biased it depends what's

82
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,879
your background right

83
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,959
for people here who are have a web

84
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,319
application security background they

85
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,440
might complain hey there should be more

86
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,519
web application security in there

87
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:46,800
i've done a lot of work on the

88
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,400
infrastructure space so obviously it's

89
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,760
maybe a little bit more biased towards

90
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,040
infrastructure

91
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,400
it also depends what's the current

92
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,480
security posture of a company

93
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,000
and so on so long story short

94
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,360
about phase one should really apply to

95
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,599
everyone afterwards it depends what's

96
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,040
the best approach for you but it's more

97
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,000
like to give you some inspiration

98
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,519
all right so

99
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:08,879
what are the security phases i have to

100
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,879
find four phases and if you do all of

101
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:11,760
those

102
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,120
you already have achieved a quite good

103
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,920
scooter back uh posture doesn't mean

104
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,840
you're completed but you have i think

105
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,519
some good achievements

106
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,440
phrase one at the very top let's say the

107
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,120
basics i'm going to talk about those in

108
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,720
detail

109
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,080
phase two these are already some

110
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,519
additional topics

111
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,120
i will briefly cover them and

112
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,120
unfortunately regarding phase three and

113
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,879
four i don't have enough time today to

114
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,120
talk about that but i have backup slides

115
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,360
if anyone should be interested

116
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,360
the idea is phrase when i say the basics

117
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,159
phase two is some topics that are again

118
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,159
easy wins but at the same time should

119
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,080
pay off on the medium term starting from

120
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,640
phase three we have some topics that

121
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,400
really either need a lot of effort or

122
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,840
are only going to pay off on the long

123
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,879
term

124
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,280
especially for phase four

125
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,040
so i say that i don't have much time so

126
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,519
let's get started voice one and this is

127
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,040
actually the very first task that you

128
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,959
have to do at the beginning so remember

129
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,480
you are coming in it's your first day

130
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,920
and you have no idea what you're dealing

131
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,879
with

132
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,480
you don't know how to secure something

133
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,239
if you don't know what you have

134
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:11,760
the first idea is you have to get an

135
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,519
overview of a cloud environment which

136
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,360
cloud providers are using how many

137
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,720
accounts do you have

138
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,079
do you have a segregation within

139
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,639
production non-production environments

140
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,720
and most importantly you need access to

141
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,240
those accounts and start looking into

142
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,240
them what kind of infrastructure is

143
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,759
deployed in those accounts what kind of

144
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,000
services are being used and

145
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,400
most importantly how are those services

146
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,720
configured from a security perspective

147
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,120
we'll talk about that a little bit later

148
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,040
if you're only dealing with a handful of

149
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,960
accounts when any others has caused it

150
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,240
accounts on google how it's called

151
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,240
projects but it's basically always a

152
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,240
cloud environment

153
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,840
you will easily run in this capability

154
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,440
problem if you have to deal with dozens

155
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,199
or maybe even hundreds of accounts you

156
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,360
can go over them manually right

157
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,639
you can click

158
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,400
login into every individual account

159
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,840
start clicking right on the dashboard

160
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,680
that's not going to scale

161
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,000
so you need some form of automation and

162
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,440
there's a lot of tools out there that

163
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,960
can really help you with that and these

164
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,320
are all open source tools that i've

165
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,840
listed here and that list is not even

166
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,600
complete which tool is the best one for

167
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,520
you depends on what you prefer working

168
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,440
with and also how many cloud platforms

169
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,520
you have to cover some are multi-cloud

170
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,759
some are only supporting one individual

171
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,840
cloud firm in particular aws because

172
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,400
it's the most widely used one it also

173
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,639
depends how you want to handle the tool

174
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,000
and what kind of output are you fine

175
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,600
with reading json output or do you need

176
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,600
some double outputs do you want to

177
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,160
process this further

178
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,440
either way i

179
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,800
personally have used steamweb a lot

180
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,560
because it's super flexible and supports

181
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,160
a lot of different platforms including

182
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,759
software source platforms like

183
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,759
cloudflare or github

184
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,440
but it is you can use that to

185
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,280
automatically obtain data from your

186
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,479
environments

187
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,720
and specifically kind of select what

188
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,000
kind of information you are looking for

189
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,639
what kind of misconfigurations maybe

190
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,319
that gives you a basic idea on how

191
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,000
serious security was taken the beginning

192
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,880
right

193
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,720
if you already see some bad things there

194
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,240
you know oh this is not a good start

195
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,560
otherwise if it's looking roughly good

196
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,479
you know okay i don't have to start from

197
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,319
the beginning

198
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,160
either way so i've used this tool to

199
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,600
collect a lot of information and then

200
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,720
have to start looking for this

201
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,800
information and the very first thing

202
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,880
that i usually want to do there that's

203
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,520
step two now parameter protection and in

204
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,440
the cloud we have two parameters the

205
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,120
first parameter is identity and access

206
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,120
management and i think this is a big

207
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,800
differentiator of cloud compared to

208
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,639
on-premise systems

209
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,120
because the cloud provider api is the

210
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,720
thing that's used to access your cloud

211
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,800
environments that's reachable over the

212
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,440
internet to everyone the only thing that

213
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,039
keeps you from getting breached on the

214
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,120
cloud provider level is to keep your

215
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,720
credentials secure

216
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,160
that's why it's so important to really

217
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,440
look at what kind of credentials are

218
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,680
currently being used

219
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,639
so

220
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,000
we have to differentiate here between

221
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,800
human users and service accounts human

222
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,599
user and we know you have a form or a

223
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,440
login form you log in with a password

224
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,599
maybe then you get in

225
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,759
that's what at least enable the s

226
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,759
supported actually you have console

227
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,720
login with a password or if you need api

228
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,479
programmatic access you have an access

229
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:09,520
key

230
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,919
both are long-term credentials that do

231
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,080
not expire and you don't have to rotate

232
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,639
them which means that's a problem

233
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,360
actually if you look into the publicly

234
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,479
known

235
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,840
security incidents of aws customers

236
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,160
very often the initial act access vector

237
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,400
for the attacker was a leaked access key

238
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,000
like somebody committing it to public

239
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,680
github repo

240
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,440
so you have to somehow get rid of those

241
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,759
access keys or more generally long-term

242
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:36,960
secrets

243
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,800
so for humans there's no need to use it

244
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,319
anymore because you can set up single

245
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,440
sign-on

246
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,520
the idea is you use singles and on and

247
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,360
then your human user can obtain a

248
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,879
short-lived token to access the cloud

249
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,160
provider interfaces including the api

250
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,599
and as we're talking about signals and

251
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,360
on we should obviously be using

252
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,960
multi-factor authentication as well

253
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,400
these days

254
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,080
and particularly for the production

255
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,680
environment environment i think it's

256
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,039
worth investing in the physical

257
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,800
authentication tokens as well like free

258
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,879
to do which i think are very cost

259
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,560
efficient

260
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,400
now single sign-on is not going to work

261
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,840
with service accounts right we need

262
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,280
something else there

263
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,720
i see quite often that you have an

264
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,240
application that's running on for

265
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,919
example google cloud

266
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,000
and needs access to the google cloud api

267
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,360
that means your application is going to

268
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,720
either credential

269
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,720
bible summits use those long term

270
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,400
secrets just for that

271
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,479
but you don't have to do that anymore

272
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,080
because the better way is to obtain a

273
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,000
short lived token from a cloud provider

274
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,520
made a data service

275
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,240
so in the case of for example aws if

276
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,240
you're running applications inside

277
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,320
kubernetes you have a feature called

278
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,080
im rules for service accounts which

279
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,559
means you sign an i role to your

280
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,800
application that means the application

281
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,320
can get a short lived token from the

282
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,240
cloud provider metadata service there is

283
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,399
no long-term secret involved anymore

284
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,000
those tokens usually only have a

285
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,399
lifetime order of magnitudes of hours

286
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,920
it's the same on google cloud the

287
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,360
feature there if they're using their

288
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,519
managed kubernetes service is a workload

289
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,360
identity which works basically the same

290
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,240
we have application running inside

291
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,240
google's managed kubernetes you assign a

292
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,399
role to it and then you can obtain

293
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,080
a short-lived document from a metadata

294
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,519
service

295
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,040
so that works very well if your

296
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,720
application needs access to the cloud

297
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,440
provider api of the same platform

298
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,040
things a little bit more complicated for

299
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,959
cross-cloud provider access

300
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,959
like application running google cloud

301
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,200
needs access to ews api or the other way

302
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,320
around

303
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,000
until maybe two years ago the only

304
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,399
solution was you generate an access key

305
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,640
in aws you export it and basically

306
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,800
import it into your application google

307
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,800
cloud which means you have a long-term

308
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,120
secret that you can leak again

309
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,320
luckily you don't have to use that

310
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,240
anymore because you can now use identity

311
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,560
federation for service accounts

312
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,399
so if i continue this example my

313
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,640
application running google cloud obtains

314
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,800
the token from google cloud as described

315
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,600
here

316
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,120
then this application starts calling

317
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,200
over to aws and authenticates with the

318
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,600
google cloud token which is accepted by

319
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,720
aws

320
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,959
and they will issue an amazon token for

321
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,440
that now application can use that amazon

322
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,680
dukel to access the api

323
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,279
and all of those tokens are again short

324
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,399
left

325
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,560
and this works because on the aws side i

326
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,240
will set up saying hey if somebody shows

327
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,519
up with a google

328
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,320
token that was issued by google and is

329
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,800
assigned a particular identity at google

330
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,600
then this person can now get an aws

331
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,200
token

332
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,880
meaning that i've completely eliminated

333
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,959
the need for long term secrets on both

334
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,600
aws and gcp on the same works with other

335
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,279
cloud platforms as well

336
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,200
which means means i have a two-story the

337
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,600
risk of leaking long-term keys which is

338
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,839
often a problem for many people or

339
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,680
companies

340
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,680
so that was about

341
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,880
access keys or credentials another issue

342
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,640
i see very often in the beginning people

343
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,320
i mean you have to sign i am privileged

344
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,240
right you have a token that's one thing

345
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,720
but you also need to define what can

346
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,959
actually access with that token

347
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,279
and people often then assign a lot of

348
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,200
privileges right because it makes life

349
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,640
easier for them

350
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,560
so it makes a lot of sense to look at

351
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,959
all those iron poses and basically see

352
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,560
if you find these kind of situations

353
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,560
where people like use white cards that

354
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,360
means can do anything to cut them down

355
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,120
so this is basically least privileged

356
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,399
principle that you have to review

357
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,320
there was the i am parameter the second

358
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,399
parameter that's basically the same

359
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,240
method we have in classical non-cloud

360
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,320
on-premise networks which is the network

361
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,480
parameter so what i have to look for is

362
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,600
there

363
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,640
two people actually have a network

364
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,959
architecture meaning a public dm set and

365
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,200
private zones where most stuff should be

366
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,720
divided in the private zones and only

367
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,320
the bare minimum should be in the public

368
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,839
zoom if public copies reachable to

369
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,040
and the second thing is firewall reviews

370
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,800
that happens really often people start

371
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,160
opening up

372
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,760
ports to the internet internet means

373
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,600
again do anyone

374
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,000
and you have to look in particular for

375
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,560
things like openmesses exports usually

376
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,000
when you open up an snh board with

377
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,760
internet it takes only a few hours and

378
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,680
people will start brute forcing you

379
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,480
then if a password like centos sent to

380
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,000
us then

381
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,800
you will be breached

382
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,200
now what i've said is we're going to

383
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,560
basically look at the output from the

384
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,040
dual and go away manually right so today

385
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,880
everything might look fine

386
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,880
maybe next week it's not fine anymore

387
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,079
because somebody has already started

388
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,240
opening up firewall rules or generated

389
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,920
access keys

390
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,160
so we cannot manually go over that every

391
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,920
single day or even once a week because

392
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,760
that's not going to scale again

393
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,079
so we need some way of automatically

394
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,839
monitoring our entire environment for

395
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,240
this kind of security violations

396
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,760
and the solution to that

397
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,360
is called cloud security booster

398
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,279
management which basically just a piece

399
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,200
of software that's going to look into

400
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,639
your cloud environments by calling the

401
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,760
apis

402
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,839
and checking if anything violates your

403
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,680
predefined security policies like what

404
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,079
i've said before right i you have access

405
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,680
keysteer somebody has opened up the

406
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,240
firewall rules somebody has a storage

407
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,839
system that is publicly reachable to

408
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,360
anyone

409
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,959
and there's different solutions for that

410
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,720
how you can implement it option one is

411
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,160
cloud provider service do you have

412
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,480
everyone supports basically has a

413
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,160
solution for that

414
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,839
there are also third body offerings for

415
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:10,800
that

416
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,800
for example software service platforms

417
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,279
basically you grant them read access to

418
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:16,480
your cloud environment and they can

419
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,399
monitor everything and then tell you or

420
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,880
raise alerts if something goes wrong

421
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,720
some also offer the tool itself so you

422
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,480
just get a software package and you

423
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,079
deploy and operate it inside your own

424
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,200
environment

425
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,480
just the advantage that you still have

426
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,079
full control and only have to grant

427
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:31,279
access to a third party to your

428
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,800
environment

429
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,440
or third option open source tools that

430
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,200
they can use to build basically your own

431
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,360
cloud security poster management

432
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,040
cloud custodian has been around for many

433
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,480
years i think it was one of the first

434
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,680
tools

435
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,199
and it's very popular i think with some

436
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,079
people

437
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,360
steamboat that i mentioned in the

438
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,760
beginning for inventory you can also use

439
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,079
it for cloud security posture management

440
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,839
although at some point depending how

441
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,600
large environment is you might run into

442
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,000
scalability problems

443
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,079
but it is this allows us to monitor

444
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,920
everything automatically once a

445
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,399
violation is deducted you get an alert

446
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,320
and you can run this maybe depending on

447
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,959
the solution in almost real time or like

448
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,479
once a day or once a week

449
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,680
so next part sooner or later you're

450
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,000
going to have a security incident

451
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,320
but it's minor mages different store but

452
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,519
when you have that happen you have to

453
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,120
start investigating

454
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,959
and investigating means you have to go

455
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,639
over your log files right

456
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,079
because without that you can't really do

457
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,000
a proper investigation

458
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,920
what i found is the easiest way to do

459
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,120
that to set up a central locator sync

460
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,440
and to just dump all your log data in

461
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,279
there just for storage at the beginning

462
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,360
and the most cost efficient solution for

463
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,199
that is to use one of the storage

464
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,760
services like amazon s3 and so on

465
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,440
because it's easy to set them up you can

466
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,199
drop as much data in there as you want

467
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,600
because this is kind of no limit and

468
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,760
they are very cost efficient as well

469
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,240
you can use the sim but that can become

470
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,680
very expensive

471
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,040
depending on what kind of solution you

472
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,480
are using because of the huge amount of

473
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,279
data that you're dropping in there

474
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,120
and the first kind of log data that we

475
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,399
feed in there is going to be the

476
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,160
operator logs

477
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,519
if you have a breach on the cloud

478
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,000
provider level that's that means the

479
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,279
attacker is going to call the cloud

480
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,959
provider apis

481
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,800
and those codes are going to show up in

482
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,880
the management api logs

483
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,000
that's why it's important that you

484
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,959
activate forwarding these api logs into

485
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,560
your central locator thing you make sure

486
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,079
nobody can mess around with that so you

487
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,639
need access control on that

488
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,560
now now we are just storing data right

489
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,000
at some point when you have security in

490
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,839
this incident you might have to compare

491
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,040
this data

492
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,639
and depending on how large your

493
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,320
environment is you are talking here

494
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,480
about varying gigabytes of data

495
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,800
10 gigabyte maybe even 100 gigabytes so

496
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,320
you're going to need some infrastructure

497
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,519
for that

498
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,959
but as i said in the beginning our

499
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,399
scenario is you're the first and only

500
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,759
security engineer you don't have the

501
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,120
time to maintain and operate

502
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,880
infrastructure for that

503
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,720
so my recommendation is here you go

504
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,120
serverless you have this uh services

505
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,519
that data lake varying services like

506
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,600
athena or bigquery

507
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,680
same should exist for azure

508
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,440
that allow you that they're very easy to

509
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,880
set up

510
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,880
they don't need any maintenance at all

511
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,480
and you can clear them all in a

512
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,160
relatively cost efficient way over your

513
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,000
entire data basically the more data you

514
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
clear the more you have to pay but if

515
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,160
you don't vary that often it makes sense

516
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,680
to that

517
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,440
it's not a lot of effort to set up

518
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,399
right then incident response as i said

519
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,759
when the internet happens you need to be

520
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,199
prepared and it's good that you have to

521
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,279
do that in advance right how does your

522
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,279
basic process look like

523
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,800
you go in the new store need to store

524
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,480
evidence somewhere so you need a

525
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,560
dedicated location for that

526
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,079
make sense to track your incidents in

527
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,399
the issue tracking system and you need

528
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,000
to find in advance who is your contact

529
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,079
person for what topic right operations

530
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,519
you have to talk to them

531
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,519
if customer data is affected you have to

532
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,279
reach out to your customers but you're

533
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,639
not going to do it yourself you need

534
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,800
someone from customer support for that

535
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,399
so that's important to define who's to

536
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,160
connect for what topic in the beginning

537
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,160
before something happens so that by the

538
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,160
time you have the incident you're ready

539
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,079
to go

540
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,160
and finally vulnerability management i

541
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,720
think that's a very old topic

542
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,400
it's not too different in cloud the only

543
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,919
difference is we have vulnerability

544
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,679
management on two levels

545
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,280
you have to scan for vulnerabilities

546
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,439
first on the container level

547
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:18,799
which also includes our application

548
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,720
dependencies and on the host level

549
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,039
meaning the host machines where our

550
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,520
containers are being executed

551
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,640
there are open source solutions

552
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,079
available for that anchor and clear

553
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,240
working very well

554
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,160
primarily for containers host machines

555
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,160
is a somewhat more complicated story i

556
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,679
don't know any

557
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,520
reliably

558
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,960
available solution for that on the open

559
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,559
source space for vulnerability scanning

560
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,799
on the host machines but

561
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,200
and one more thing

562
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,360
cicd-based scanning makes a lot of sense

563
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,280
yes but it's not sufficient right if i

564
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,360
build a convenient image today as kenny

565
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,039
today and has no vulnerabilities this

566
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,960
assessment might not longer be true next

567
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,840
week

568
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,919
so any continuous vulnerability scanning

569
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,520
that's something some people forget

570
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,200
about that

571
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,000
and

572
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
identifying vulnerabilities is one thing

573
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,080
fixing them is another story we have to

574
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,080
write on slas for that with engineering

575
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,840
and agree on something like

576
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,679
one week to get a critical or high

577
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,039
vulnerability fixed or something like

578
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,880
that

579
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,120
well and that's already phase one

580
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,200
this should give you a base standing

581
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,200
that will take you at least weeks maybe

582
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,480
a few months depending on how much

583
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,799
incompany support you will get for that

584
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,280
after that will continue with phase two

585
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,799
and then the first thing is defining the

586
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,960
security baseline as secure engineer

587
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,280
usually know what you should do right

588
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,200
but that's usually not clear engineering

589
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,600
so it's very important to write it down

590
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,280
define what are your expectations

591
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,360
towards engineering for that and you

592
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,400
don't have to come

593
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,400
up with this yourself there's a lot of

594
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,919
good stuff out there in particular the

595
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,600
cs benchmarks

596
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,480
they have

597
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,919
basically securely best practice not

598
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,440
only for club providers but also for

599
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,600
kubernetes for docker images and so on

600
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,679
it makes sense to just adopt those

601
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,120
standards

602
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,440
once i've written down my baseline i

603
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,880
need to set up the monitoring for that

604
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,000
right to see if people are actually

605
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,080
following my security baseline

606
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,440
and this is where i can use the cloud

607
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,120
security booster management because i

608
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,400
have to implement

609
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,000
my baseline basically in there to look

610
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,120
for violations of my baseline

611
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,679
then another easy win kubernetes or

612
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,679
container deployments

613
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,039
a lot of people when they run the

614
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,559
application inside containers those

615
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,520
applications are running as root

616
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,080
i've seen this so often i think it's a i

617
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,520
don't know what's going on there but

618
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,520
nobody's thinking about that there's a

619
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,520
very easy way to override that

620
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,960
in kubernetes you have a so-called

621
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,799
security context object and there you

622
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,640
have a parameter called run that's used

623
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,400
allows you to overwrite that

624
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,880
you just specify in your deployments no

625
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,559
run this as an unprivileged user and

626
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,720
then it's no longer running as root

627
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,960
it's super easy to implement

628
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,120
and there's a lot more security features

629
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,160
in kubernetes that you can use

630
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,520
finally or something that people

631
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,720
sometimes miss

632
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,640
if you have two applications running in

633
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,480
the same kubernetes cluster

634
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,400
there is no network isolation between

635
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,720
those applications application a can

636
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,480
always reach application b and via

637
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,720
verizon that's just the ways vanilla

638
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,480
kubernetes works

639
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,080
the way to fix that is to use so-called

640
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,919
kubernetes network policies which are

641
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,000
usually never enabled by default you

642
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,440
have to explicitly enable them and start

643
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,679
deploying network policies which means

644
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,360
basically is a firewall rule that

645
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,199
applies inside the kubernetes cluster

646
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,919
then again as i said about using this

647
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,320
run as user option how can you be sure

648
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,159
that people are actually using that you

649
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:31,760
have to again set up the monitoring for

650
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,559
that

651
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:33,919
that means you have to extend your cloud

652
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,600
security booster management also monitor

653
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,120
your kubernetes clusters to see what

654
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,480
people are deploying there actually and

655
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,720
how

656
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,159
a very different topic so security and

657
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,200
cloud usually means you have a

658
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,120
scalability problem that means you need

659
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,600
to automate as much as possible

660
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,039
for that you are usually going to need

661
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,720
some tool right for example i want to

662
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,240
run a dynamic application security

663
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,760
testing once a week

664
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,159
i want to run some board scans maybe

665
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,159
every day same with credential scanning

666
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,200
maybe

667
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,799
so i need some platform that allows me

668
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,799
to define what tool am i using

669
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,640
how i'm going to call this tool how i'm

670
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,159
going to process the output and where do

671
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,919
i push these outputs then i need the

672
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,600
time sketcher for that

673
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,520
this is what workflow orchestration

674
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,799
engines are very useful for again the

675
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,960
cloud provider services serverless to

676
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,880
allow you to do that there's also two

677
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,880
kubernetes frameworks for that which is

678
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,360
algo and dactone i personally used a lot

679
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,840
of aggro workflows but functionally it's

680
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,280
almost the same as stacked on so it

681
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,440
doesn't really make a difference

682
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,120
or if you don't have that much secured

683
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,799
animation of course you can just spin up

684
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,480
a virtual machine with a crunch up on it

685
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,440
that schedules everything

686
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,159
a lot of this is reactive right it's how

687
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,840
do we get things in a more proactive

688
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,520
mode this is not even cloud specific you

689
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,640
have to hook into the software

690
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,720
development lifecycle that means i need

691
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,480
to be involved in the design phase

692
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,400
otherwise i will always be keep running

693
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,960
after people get things done

694
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,120
and yeah the band is kind of obvious i

695
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,559
think

696
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,200
right and that's phase two and then in

697
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,520
theory i can continue with phrase three

698
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,039
and four depending on what i want to do

699
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,360
and so on and how to secure the boost js

700
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,080
now

701
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,679
now before wrapping up some final

702
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:10,960
thoughts

703
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,840
so our startup sme is doing business

704
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,200
dealing with business customers and

705
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,280
there are some customers that would say

706
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,760
i really like your service offering but

707
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,840
i will only do business with you if you

708
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,760
have a security certification like iso

709
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,120
107000 or soc2 or something like that

710
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,000
now

711
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,919
i'm not going to get in topic if those

712
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,840
certifications are going to improve your

713
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,919
security posture but i think that's the

714
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,440
wrong way of looking at you can use

715
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,919
those programs to actually push for your

716
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,240
security camera to get things done

717
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,000
because if somebody asks you hey why do

718
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,080
we have to do this you see well we need

719
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,159
this for stock too and if you don't have

720
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,799
stock 2 we will not win that customer

721
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,080
so that will help you a lot because

722
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,760
nobody is going to argue about bringing

723
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,720
more revenue right so you've changed

724
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,559
security of not being a business enabler

725
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,159
which is making discussions a little bit

726
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,480
easier in my experience

727
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,919
yeah and finally

728
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,640
that's my culture question how are you

729
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,720
approaching security right my security

730
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,480
is a very cross-functional role we have

731
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,240
to deal with a lot of people right you

732
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,919
talk to customers about for incidents

733
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,080
and as we're talking about product

734
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,679
security we are dealing a lot with

735
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:16,880
engineering

736
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,240
you have to build a relationship with

737
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,080
them and that means

738
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,600
are you going to be guy guy who's just

739
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,200
going to make trouble for them and go is

740
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,200
going to blocking them all the time or

741
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,039
are you more seen as a valuable support

742
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,559
function because this can really

743
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,320
influence a lot and how whether they are

744
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,678
willing to work for few or not

745
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,640
right

746
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,880
and before i wrap up i'm not the first

747
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,240
person to think about how to do this in

748
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,679
structured way there's a lot of very

749
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,520
interesting material out there in terms

750
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,559
of talks

751
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,480
and also documents i highly recommend

752
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,080
going for this if you are interested in

753
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,919
this topic

754
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,840
well and that's it

755
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:58,400
[Applause]

756
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,919
thank you very much christian for the

757
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,600
interesting talk i think the one key

758
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,360
takeaway is that as a security person

759
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,279
you should not try to be the blocker but

760
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,279
more like a valuable resource that's a

761
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,520
very good recommendation i think um are

762
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,960
there any questions from the audience

763
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,200
please step forward and

764
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,200
um

765
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,480
hi thank you great talk um

766
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,960
i was wondering uh what is a good way to

767
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,600
get more support by the engineering team

768
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,559
and everybody in the company for getting

769
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,840
a better security system

770
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,720
that's a tough question

771
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,559
well

772
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:41,679
i think

773
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:42,960
there was one of the slides that have a

774
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,559
roof for time reasons i think you need

775
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,799
management support if management doesn't

776
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,960
care about security

777
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,880
then things are going to be difficult

778
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,400
and the other thing

779
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,159
i think

780
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,520
if you work with different teams there

781
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,960
also people who are for security and

782
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,240
some people who don't care it's

783
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,320
important to identify basically those

784
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,799
people who are interested in security

785
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:03,919
because those are going to be their

786
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,200
allies

787
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,480
and i think these are basic kind of

788
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,080
security champions that they can try to

789
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,320
push

790
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,799
thank you

791
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,520
hey a question about the last thing you

792
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,600
you touched on on on security culture um

793
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,360
yeah are they building relationships

794
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,200
with other departments and not being a

795
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,360
blocker

796
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,720
sounds great

797
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,080
until someone you hear that someone is

798
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,720
trying to put an rdp password logon

799
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,000
machine on on a public ipv4 address so

800
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,559
where's the there's you have the the one

801
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,200
side where you everybody here at least

802
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,360
thinks they have to put the foot down

803
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,200
but then you you kind of go against that

804
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,320
how do you keep balance

805
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,720
yeah so there's an interesting talk from

806
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,279
netflix and their security culture says

807
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,200
trust but verify

808
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,039
their idea is the fd monitoring in place

809
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,200
if you if one team screws up the money

810
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,400
will show it up immediately and then

811
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,840
they go to those people hey people you

812
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,279
have to fix this

813
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,200
and you have dashboards that show how

814
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,039
well teams are doing

815
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,240
they're kind of playing the teams

816
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,600
against each other

817
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,200
saying oh this team is really doing well

818
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,039
you're more like down there maybe it

819
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,640
should really do something this kind of

820
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,679
an intrinsic motivation for other teams

821
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,039
that works for netflix i don't know if

822
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,760
that works in other places too

823
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,480
all right thanks

824
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,720
um

825
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,960
so actually regarding

826
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,400
working with departments with our

827
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,120
departments from my experience

828
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,600
it helps so this also knows with others

829
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,960
when you

830
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,039
accept that they have problems or issues

831
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:44,799
when they when you take them serious

832
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,120
from my perspective they take also

833
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,080
serious if you see that you're competent

834
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,240
most of the time what what uh

835
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,320
developers and engineers think okay

836
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,159
someone comes around and he wants

837
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,000
something but we have other problems so

838
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,919
that's just a remark i have two

839
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,039
questions

840
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,960
um first you

841
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,279
talked about setting up a perimeter

842
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,080
there's nowadays this thing called zero

843
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,919
trust model and there are a lot of guys

844
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,080
are saying oh we everything has to be

845
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,039
secure with zero trust what do you think

846
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:18,880
about that one would be a first question

847
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,440
yeah

848
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,600
so i mean it's possible right zero trust

849
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,559
i mean i'd say

850
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,559
the thing is um

851
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:35,120
with uh with the perimeter you kinda so

852
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,279
if you had said in this later phase

853
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,919
you remove the parameter and do

854
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,080
everything for example in vpn or

855
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,559
separate contain control and data plane

856
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,480
then i would say okay for the first step

857
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,640
parameters are good but when my

858
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,679
experience

859
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,919
especially still in cloud people are

860
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,080
doing oh i'm inter

861
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,399
in the trusted parameters so that's no

862
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,199
problem anymore

863
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,600
right well i mean i think it's not going

864
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,640
to

865
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,080
i'm not going to say this will still

866
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,440
just remove the network pyramid you

867
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,120
still have it right said in kubernetes

868
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,399
inside

869
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,000
this idea you are inside a trusted

870
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,679
island then everything is good i think

871
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:12,960
zero data for me is the opposite this

872
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,960
means you means micro segmentation

873
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,799
and micro segmentation for me includes

874
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,640
network parameter maybe on a smaller

875
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,320
level but still

876
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,399
it's there and i think the im is

877
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:23,760
actually in cloud is very easy to do

878
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,080
serial rust for human users you can say

879
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,000
you allowed you can set up imports to

880
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,399
say you log log in but only monday to

881
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:31,840
friday and only from a particular p

882
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,000
address range for example

883
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,600
i think it cloud is maybe the easiest

884
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,840
place to implement zero trust

885
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,799
yeah

886
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,240
the second question

887
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,840
i was a little bit surprised that you

888
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,320
did not talk when talking about to the

889
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,720
developers about the supply chain stuff

890
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,760
because especially i'm more of an

891
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,000
infrastructure guy myself but the thing

892
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,279
is

893
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,279
uh with total with the packages

894
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,440
situation today in our days i would say

895
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,919
okay we have really look where

896
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,840
software where the developers go

897
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,520
they're getting their software from and

898
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,960
their libraries

899
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,200
so um

900
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,520
in which phase would you say is that

901
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,279
later on

902
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:12,399
it depends

903
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:13,919
okay so

904
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:14,960
well

905
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,799
i mean if you had problems or in this

906
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,480
direction you should pull this into

907
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,880
phase three at least obviously right i

908
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,399
mean i mean availability management is

909
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:24,000
companies a little bit

910
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,279
but not completely obviously but

911
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,000
i'd say i probably put it into phase

912
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,960
four

913
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,399
okay

914
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,959
cool thanks

915
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,840
over time a bit already is it a quick

916
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,760
one or

917
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,120
thanks thanks again for the presentation

918
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,640
so i'm wondering so here you're starting

919
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,919
with the assumption that you have a full

920
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,840
access into the network into oh to the

921
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,279
system visibility

922
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:48,960
how much would it be different if you

923
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,960
have a partial or a non-view you know if

924
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,720
some part is outsourced

925
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,720
or you're you're a part of the team that

926
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,000
is actually doesn't have access to the

927
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,679
entire system

928
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,120
well if you have no few you have a

929
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,440
problem right you know i mean you can

930
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,760
still do the pyramid all right scan that

931
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,960
but that's it

932
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,640
if you have a partial few

933
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,159
it depends i think a lot what do you

934
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,240
have access to like do you have super

935
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,080
access to copyright api or do you and

936
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,760
that's it or do you also have to look

937
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,919
have access into host machines and

938
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:17,440
things like that

939
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,760
i think you should always go for

940
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,520
acts as a security team because actually

941
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,799
most club providers will give you a

942
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,880
dedicated security read-only role just

943
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,559
for that purpose it's called security

944
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:27,840
auditor rule

945
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,120
and you should always go for that i

946
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,640
think if you don't have that then you

947
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,320
can't do work i mean it's impossible

948
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,960
cool great stuff um thank you very much

949
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,320
christian thanks to the audience for the

950
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,750
good questions

951
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:43,869
