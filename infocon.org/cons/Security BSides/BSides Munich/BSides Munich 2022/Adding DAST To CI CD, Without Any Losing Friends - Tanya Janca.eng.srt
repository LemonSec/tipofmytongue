1
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:06,640
hi everyone i really really appreciate

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,120
snea and the entire besides team having

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,559
me here and thank you for letting me

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,160
present virtually

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,000
because sometimes you just can't make it

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,480
to the place you really want to be at so

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,400
this talk is called adding dats to ci cd

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,800
so adding dash as in like a dynamic

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,880
application security testing tool

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,279
sometimes people say oh yeah web app

11
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,359
scanner and i sort of mean that yes but

12
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,520
i started writing this out and then i

13
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,040
remembered when

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,200
people first started adding vasts to

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,200
pipelines where i worked and i was the

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,440
person adding them and it didn't happen

17
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,440
exactly like this but it felt a bit like

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,480
this

19
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,800
so i was like i've added the scanner to

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,320
your pipeline and the software

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,360
developers were like it is too slow this

22
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,680
is taking forever and then we went

23
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,199
through the results and there was a

24
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,680
false positive in the tool because i was

25
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,640
using a free tool it was perhaps

26
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,640
like it i thought it was amazing at the

27
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,360
time right and i i'm like but i found

28
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,400
eight real bugs automatically

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,880
um but they're like it's too slow and it

30
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,799
felt like one false positive breaking

31
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,880
the build is not acceptable so then i

32
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,400
was like i should change the name of

33
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,400
this talk from just adding dast to ci cd

34
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,720
without losing any friends because if

35
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,040
you don't have a good relationship with

36
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,640
the software developers and if you're

37
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,880
doing devops with the ops team you're

38
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,759
just

39
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,520
so not only are you not going to be able

40
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,000
to have coffee with the cool kids but on

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,560
top of that it's like really really hard

42
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,360
to get your job done without i'm taking

43
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,880
off my sweater because when i talk i

44
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,560
like move around a lot and i get really

45
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,880
warm um

46
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,360
but it's it's really hard to get the

47
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,200
things you want done

48
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,960
without taking everyone off if you're

49
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,479
not careful and so we're going to talk

50
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,920
about different ways that you can do

51
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,920
that so you can put this tool in a

52
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,840
pipeline and get really good results but

53
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,840
also all the places not in a pipeline

54
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,280
that you can put it

55
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,119
but still automate it and still get good

56
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,520
results and a whole bunch of just other

57
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,479
tests you can do etc so like who's this

58
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,878
person that's friends with sneha

59
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,879
so i am a giant nerd and i'm the

60
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,720
director of developer relations and

61
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,520
community at bright security um i

62
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,280
founded the wehack purple community

63
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,560
where you can take a bunch of training

64
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,920
courses for free about software security

65
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,680
my obsession

66
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,000
i'm on the internet i wrote a book

67
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,879
called allison bob learn appsec i did

68
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:31,920
basically

69
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,480
so the main gist of this slide

70
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,239
is that i'm a nerd on the internet i've

71
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,800
been a nerd for a really long time and

72
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,319
i'm hoping that you will sit through my

73
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,080
presentation and give me a chance

74
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,440
because you're like she seems pretty

75
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,040
competent

76
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,360
so that is me where i have slightly

77
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,720
longer hair

78
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,760
okay

79
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,680
so what problem are we trying to solve

80
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,560
because

81
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,160
all of these talks that you saw we're

82
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,040
trying to solve a problem and what we

83
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,680
one of my main things i want to solve

84
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,879
just in my career is insecure software

85
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,200
um it's causing data breaches around the

86
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,200
world it's the number one cause of data

87
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,239
breaches

88
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,319
it's not the number one cause of

89
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,400
software security it's not the number

90
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,640
one cause of security incidents it's not

91
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,080
the number one cause of people having

92
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,480
their money stolen it's people stealing

93
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,319
all of your data which is the most

94
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,239
damaging type of security incident you

95
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:23,440
can have

96
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,159
i would like us to not win this occasion

97
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,319
every year so every year

98
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,200
verizon which is an american company

99
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,040
makes this breach report and they've

100
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,120
been doing it since 2008

101
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,879
and pretty much every year

102
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,640
insecure software wins the worst title

103
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,640
of being the number one cause of data

104
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,319
breaches and

105
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,360
i want us to do better

106
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,640
um another problem we're trying to solve

107
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,560
is if we're going to work in a devops

108
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,239
shop and we're going to try to make

109
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,560
their software more secure

110
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,760
we need

111
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,560
our tools to be accurate need them to go

112
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,799
really fast and whatever we can do we

113
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,640
need to automate so there's going to be

114
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,720
way more devops people than security

115
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,200
people it's just a fact there's way way

116
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,760
way more software developers than appsec

117
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,439
people github released a report in uh

118
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,560
january

119
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,880
that said so it used to be one to one

120
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,798
hundreds there'd be one abstract per

121
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,560
person for every dev

122
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,120
now it's 500 to one

123
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,600
those are not great odds so we need to

124
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,040
do we need to be accurate but we need to

125
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,600
also be fast and

126
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,360
try to automate

127
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,639
and so

128
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,040
if we want to do devsecops so us

129
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,120
security folks doing security in a

130
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,960
devops environment

131
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,600
we need to test from multiple angles

132
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,840
so we can't just do one test and be like

133
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,520
i'm sure it's fine

134
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,040
that's not good enough

135
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,800
we need to have good relationships

136
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,759
between security dev and ops and i don't

137
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,280
mean that like you have to give them

138
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,280
hugs or you go grocery shopping with

139
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,440
them but i mean that we have to be able

140
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,440
to work with them and have a good

141
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,840
relationship so i can say things like

142
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,840
hey did you see those test results and

143
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,600
the person answers you know something

144
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,600
like yeah i did or i got the email i

145
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,360
haven't had a chance to read it yet or

146
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,440
yeah i've been meaning to talk to you

147
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,440
i need them to not answer with go to

148
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,360
hell tanya you broke our pipeline again

149
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,440
i need to maintain a good relationship

150
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,520
so i can get my job done

151
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,520
i have worked at places where the

152
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,360
security team and the software

153
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,240
developers were like that's just er all

154
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,320
the time and i spent like half of every

155
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,479
week just trying to put out

156
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,880
angry emotional fires

157
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,960
of people that didn't trust each other

158
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,120
that didn't like working together etc

159
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,720
and so if you have a good relationship

160
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,960
you get twice as much done

161
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,800
and then the last thing is

162
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,400
i want bugs fixed as soon as possible

163
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,160
and i don't mean i want them fixed on

164
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,120
monday instead of friday i mean if we're

165
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,800
following the system development life

166
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,479
cycle so if you're doing waterfalls like

167
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,960
this it's like requirements design

168
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,919
coding testing release if you're doing

169
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,240
agile you do that same thing but you do

170
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,759
it in a circle and you release a whole

171
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,759
bunch of times if you're doing devops

172
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,919
you do the eternity symbol where you're

173
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,240
like yep got it got it releasing it got

174
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,080
it releasing it got it release it and

175
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,000
you just continue to release over and

176
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,360
over again even more often than agile

177
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,280
and so automation is our only way that

178
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,400
we can keep up with those people and i

179
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,800
want them fixing those bugs as soon as

180
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,120
we find them or as soon as they have

181
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,360
time i don't want things waiting until

182
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,280
later i don't want the software

183
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,360
developers or the operations folks

184
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,440
thinking like is tonya ever gonna tell

185
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,960
me what's wrong she ever gonna do a test

186
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,720
like where is that lady

187
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,280
i want to be there for them and know

188
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,520
i want them to know that i can help

189
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,560
and so

190
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,479
fixing books as soon as possible in the

191
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,560
system development life cycle the reason

192
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,120
i want that is because it's way cheaper

193
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,199
it's way way cheaper that way

194
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,160
so

195
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,240
what are so today we're going to zero in

196
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,160
specifically on das so

197
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,479
right security bought my company a few

198
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,400
weeks ago and they make a desk and so

199
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,919
when they're like oh or you know you're

200
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,680
gonna start applying to companies what

201
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,960
you want to talk about i won't talk

202
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,800
about that and how people can do it

203
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,560
right because i see a lot of people buy

204
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,479
tools and they don't do it right and

205
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,840
they don't get good results i want

206
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,720
people to get better results

207
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,360
so what the heck is fast so it stands

208
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,599
for dynamic application security testing

209
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,440
what it means is that your app needs to

210
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,960
be running

211
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,120
so it could be localhost it could be a

212
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,199
web server it could be a container a

213
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,039
platform as a service it doesn't matter

214
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,039
but your app is running like you can see

215
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,199
the software in a browser

216
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,680
and then it sends requests

217
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,759
at your app to try to find security

218
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,240
vulnerabilities your app responds and it

219
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,000
goes back and forth like this it can

220
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,919
also do apis where it sends requests to

221
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,680
your apis it receives the response it

222
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,919
goes back and forth and the idea is it's

223
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:58,879
sort of

224
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,879
a computer conversation

225
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,400
and it just keeps trying to find all

226
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,160
your vulnerabilities and it does this in

227
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,400
an automated way so it's like hey how's

228
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,879
it going oh it's not going so well oh is

229
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,879
it going like this okay yeah and then

230
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,639
from that conversation it starts

231
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,360
crafting better and better tests

232
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,960
it automates this for you so you could

233
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,720
just like sit back and be like oh okay

234
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,639
this is happening that's good

235
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,520
it's different than static testing or

236
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,120
software composition analysis that

237
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,440
requires a copy of your code

238
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,759
so i used to be a pen tester and they

239
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,680
wouldn't give me a copy of the code

240
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,760
so i had to do all my tests in a dynamic

241
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,839
manner where i was trying to talk to the

242
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,559
app either manually or with a das tool

243
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,799
but the idea is it interacts with your

244
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,599
app to try to find out what's wrong

245
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,080
and so why did i

246
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,080
decide to zero in on that so when so i

247
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,720
was a software developer for around 17

248
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,959
years i briefly took a a break as a

249
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,000
system

250
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,600
and then came back to software my true

251
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,640
love

252
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,959
and basically

253
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,120
i started when i moved into security

254
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,440
with a dynamic scanner i found it way

255
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,760
easier than static analysis or software

256
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,720
composition analysis i found it easier

257
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,320
than trying to figure out because this

258
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,240
is a secret it's just a secret i thought

259
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,480
it was the easiest one and i find a lot

260
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,000
of people who are first getting into

261
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,080
these things they find it easy too

262
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,080
i also so maybe i'm not supposed to

263
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,839
admit this but like the first time i ran

264
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,600
a dash and i found vulnerabilities i'm

265
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,480
like i'm a hacker and it felt very

266
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,720
exciting and i know that might sound

267
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,320
silly because i'm like you know in my

268
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,080
mid 40s and i've been doing this a long

269
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,839
time but i don't know how to explain

270
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,120
whenever i find stuff i'm like yeah

271
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,959
that's right i'm awesome

272
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,640
but the last one which is probably the

273
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,839
most important one is that your app is

274
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,360
out there sitting on the internet your

275
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,760
api unless it has a gateway in front of

276
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,600
it or a bunch of firewalls in front of

277
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,880
it is out there sitting on the internet

278
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,760
and on the internet anyone can point a

279
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,800
dash data and scan it if you have a waff

280
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,320
or you have other defenses you could

281
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,399
probably shoot away but most the

282
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,480
internet doesn't have a web application

283
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,640
firewall or a runtime application

284
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,560
security protection tool so like a

285
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,240
shield for your app most of the internet

286
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,600
doesn't have that

287
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,839
and so that means basically anyone with

288
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,440
very little skill can just point a

289
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,519
dynamic scanner at you and find

290
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,680
vulnerabilities there are usually

291
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,399
exploitable and so it's the most obvious

292
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,320
place to start because that's where bad

293
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,240
guys start unless you're open source

294
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,680
they don't have a copy of your code

295
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,360
unless they're an insider threat they

296
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,160
can't test from the inside so a desk can

297
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,000
just test from anywhere on the planet

298
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,160
and it doesn't take very long to find

299
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,079
problems and so i want us to fix those

300
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,839
problems first because they are the most

301
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,920
evident to people that might be

302
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,279
malicious

303
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,399
and so what is devops so this is a very

304
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,959
short and small summary

305
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,360
so devops is spoiler alert it's not

306
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,760
paying one person to two jobs that's not

307
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,800
what it is

308
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,279
so basically devops is a newer

309
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,839
way to create software it's a

310
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,480
methodology and it's a culture so you

311
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,200
follow certain processes people act and

312
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,600
feel certain ways and you often use

313
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,000
certain tools to reinforce it so we're

314
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,519
going to talk about it a bit more so

315
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,040
sometimes people will say it's people

316
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,959
products and processes

317
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,880
i don't really like that i like the idea

318
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,079
of us following the three ways of devops

319
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,279
but i digress next slide so as so first

320
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,399
of all if you're doing devops you

321
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,560
usually have a ci cd so it's continuous

322
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,200
integration continuous delivery

323
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,200
or continuous deployment depending upon

324
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,120
how you're using it but it's automated

325
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,399
software

326
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,800
that tests and releases your software

327
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,320
and your infrastructure to different

328
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,600
environments

329
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,079
so it takes a copy of your code and

330
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,480
builds it and tests it and then it's

331
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,079
like oh i'm going to put it on a dev

332
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,079
server i'm going to test it again oh i'm

333
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,519
going to build it like i'm going to take

334
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,880
that artifact i'm going to copy it to

335
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,480
the qa server i'm going to run even more

336
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,440
tests

337
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,399
and it does this with your

338
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,920
infrastructure as well it can actually

339
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,920
build the infrastructure and then plop

340
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,839
your app on it and test them together

341
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,440
and it's

342
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,600
i think it's quite nifty

343
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,240
so then if we want to do devops there

344
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,360
are

345
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,360
the three ways of devops so sort of like

346
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,279
the three rules you need to kind of do

347
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,720
these things if you want to get all the

348
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,200
value that you can of devops and so the

349
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,440
first one is efficiency for the entire

350
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,240
system and so when i see that i'm like

351
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,000
not just your part tanya

352
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,160
you have to like share with everyone and

353
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,839
so that's important

354
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,560
fast feedback and so then i added to

355
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,480
that that is accurate and gets to the

356
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,760
right to people

357
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,320
it's nice if there's fast feedback

358
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,600
that gets the right people but if

359
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,200
there's fast feedback but it's totally

360
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,320
inaccurate

361
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,399
or like you can't actually see it or you

362
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,800
have to attend 20 meetings to get a copy

363
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,040
that's not

364
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,880
and then the third way is continuous

365
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,200
learning and improvement of your daily

366
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,279
work sometimes people call this risk

367
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,120
taking but the idea is is that you step

368
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,360
back from your daily activities and

369
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,440
exert effort to making your daily

370
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,680
activities even better on a regular

371
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,480
basis usually every month

372
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,920
the last thing i want to say about

373
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,079
devops is that not all security testing

374
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,160
needs to be done in the pipeline for you

375
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,639
to be doing devops so you can do brief

376
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,040
checks in the pipeline

377
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,399
and then do

378
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,240
like slow checks overnight like there's

379
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,800
a lot of different options and so we're

380
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,720
going to talk about that

381
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,959
so let's talk strategy for putting a

382
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,519
dynamic scanner in your ci cd

383
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,040
so the first one that i see the most

384
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,200
often when i i did at the beginning that

385
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,200
made all the other dads pretty ticked

386
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,079
off at me was to run my desk on full

387
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,279
blast

388
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,279
and then lose all your friends so what i

389
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,680
mean by this is

390
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,639
turning it on saying do every test

391
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:41,839
you know

392
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,680
catalog all my different links test

393
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,760
every single part of my whole app as

394
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,440
thoroughly as you possibly can and then

395
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,720
it might run like six hours or something

396
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,480
and no one's impressed by that if the

397
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,560
pipeline previously ran 18 minutes and

398
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,279
now it runs 6 hours and 18 minutes no

399
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,920
one's gonna be very cool with that so

400
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,480
this is not the one you want to do

401
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,480
in the release pipeline so the release

402
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,000
pipeline is the one that everyone's

403
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,240
using to release all their code so what

404
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,639
you could do instead of this is that you

405
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,399
could take a copy of the release

406
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,800
pipeline put it underneath in your ci

407
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,480
cicd software

408
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,720
and then make it so it doesn't release

409
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,720
or it just releases to one safe place

410
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,560
where you can do security testing and

411
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,240
you put it there and you run the

412
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,079
security test and then that's it and

413
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,440
then the results

414
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,040
go to the software developers or it goes

415
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,480
to the security person so that they can

416
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,320
see it and take action

417
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,320
so that would be a better way to do it

418
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,399
so you're not blocking production you

419
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,160
can still get a very thorough test done

420
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,920
so sometimes this is called a parallel

421
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,720
pipeline or an asynchronous pipeline and

422
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,399
you can run it nice and long and slow

423
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,160
and you can run it like every night or

424
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,600
every friday

425
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,959
and have those results get sent

426
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,639
somewhere for someone to manually look

427
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,320
through that

428
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,519
so the next thing you could do is you

429
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,600
could refine your scope by using a

430
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,199
horror file so

431
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,079
r

432
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,600
h a r stands for html archive file so if

433
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,760
your software developer or sorry your qa

434
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,440
team are doing something

435
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,519
using something like selenium to do

436
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,839
automated tests of your app you can get

437
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,240
a copy of that file that's a har file

438
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,920
that they're recording when they do all

439
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,920
of that cool automation you can feed

440
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,079
that into your dynamic scanner

441
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,639
and then it will just do that test you

442
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:21,440
can

443
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,480
basically make your your test 30 of the

444
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,000
time like instead it's like 70 faster or

445
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,440
even faster than that because you're

446
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,120
just testing whatever new feature you're

447
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,720
releasing or you're just testing the new

448
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,480
code or you're just testing what the qa

449
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,880
person thinks is important

450
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,279
and is this complete coverage no but

451
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,880
this would be part of the coverage you

452
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,240
do so it's like we're just gonna test

453
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,680
this in the pipeline very quickly it's

454
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,519
gonna take six minutes

455
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,440
and if you break like if you do get a

456
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,120
high or critical illness we're gonna

457
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,399
break the build

458
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,000
but for all the other testing we're

459
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,240
gonna do it outside the pipeline and we

460
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,000
still might come to you and need fixes

461
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,199
but this is what we think is an

462
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,480
emergency and so it goes in the pipeline

463
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,320
another thing you can do so when i first

464
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,199
showed this app this um slide to people

465
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,720
they're like you can't just test only

466
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,800
what you want to test tanya i'm like

467
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,000
sometimes you can so quite often um when

468
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,920
i work places we'll have specific

469
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,399
vulnerabilities we're targeting or types

470
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,320
of bugs that we're targeting that are

471
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,839
really important to us that we feel are

472
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,759
particularly dangerous or we see a lot

473
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,399
of

474
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,320
and so in the pipeline i might just test

475
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,079
for those like just injection or just

476
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,399
cross-site scripting and that's it or

477
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,399
maybe we have like a new

478
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,480
um security policy and we just want to

479
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,160
target in on security headers and like

480
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,600
no one's using security headers so we

481
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,279
just test for that it's like you know

482
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,959
what you're breaking the policy you know

483
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,399
we're all looking for this so you can't

484
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,320
go to prod but then i do my other

485
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,959
extensive testing outside of prod and so

486
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,800
that way what you could do is slowly

487
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,120
eliminate a certain type of bug

488
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,519
and then in a few weeks you change to a

489
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:54,880
new vulnerability that you're looking

490
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,639
for and that would be really really fast

491
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,079
another thing you can do that i think

492
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,320
everyone should do every single time

493
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,280
is only do technology specific tests

494
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,720
so let's say

495
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,439
you have a wordpress application or

496
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:10,799
website

497
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,280
you would only do the like you you would

498
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,039
do the wordpress sites

499
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,160
but you wouldn't do an mssql test

500
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,160
because you would be running postgresql

501
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,319
because that is what wordpress runs on

502
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,400
you wouldn't do a ruby on rails test

503
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,439
right because you're using wordpress and

504
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,000
so on and so you just do the technology

505
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,760
tests that are specific to what you're

506
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,480
doing and so i always want to do this so

507
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,080
if i'm scanning an app that's made in

508
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,679
node.js

509
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,080
and it's using mongodb i definitely want

510
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,480
to do all the specific tests for those

511
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,160
and i'll do other tests that apply to

512
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,559
every type of website but i'm like oh no

513
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,840
ms sql no wordpress tests know this know

514
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,880
that and i just throw them in the

515
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,480
garbage because i know they just don't

516
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,440
apply

517
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,760
like if you're in azure you don't need

518
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,480
to do aws tests right

519
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,000
and so this is something that i

520
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,160
generally do all the time because

521
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,919
our time is valuable we're busy people

522
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,679
um i wanted to say a quick note on

523
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,080
testing apis if you want to test an api

524
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,960
with a dynamic scanner in a pipeline or

525
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,400
not in a pipeline

526
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,480
it's very very important that your

527
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,440
schema file or your definition file your

528
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,760
open api file your swagger file whatever

529
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,679
you want to call the thing that defines

530
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,840
your api

531
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,520
it needs to be complete

532
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,640
and you can complete it using a linter

533
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,640
and so some dynamic scanners have a

534
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,960
linter built into them like bright does

535
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,960
there's a few that do that and so you

536
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,520
just open up your api or there's

537
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,280
separate like

538
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,559
software things that just lint your api

539
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,320
and they're very very thorough

540
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,000
and so basically you use one of those

541
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,240
and you open up your definition file and

542
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,679
it will tell you things that are missing

543
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,760
and so i used to be a dev and i did all

544
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,280
of the mistakes that i tell people not

545
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,640
to do now

546
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,400
because i went to college in the 90s for

547
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,240
software development and so

548
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,720
i never learned that had to learn it on

549
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,320
my own

550
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,880
and so it will do things like so like

551
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,559
let's say you've declared a vulnerable

552
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,240
you've declared a variable and the

553
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,960
variable is date of birth so usually

554
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,640
people will be like date of birth type

555
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,640
date and that's it

556
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,880
but the scanner needs to know what's the

557
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,400
maximum

558
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,280
date what's the minimum date does it can

559
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,200
it only be in the past

560
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,919
um like can a person be 5000 years old

561
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,919
what is the format of the date etc so if

562
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,520
you don't fill those out the dynamic

563
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,919
scanner can't test that for you

564
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,200
and so

565
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,679
usually if you just take an open api

566
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,400
file or swagger file and you plug it in

567
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,640
most dash scanners like kind of barf

568
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,679
they don't know what to do and they're

569
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,000
like yeah it looks good to me i guess

570
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,600
because your file is not complete so you

571
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,760
need to use a linter on it to make sure

572
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,200
it is complete

573
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,120
and when you make it complete like when

574
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,440
you add the maximums and minimums and

575
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,799
the file type the formats etc

576
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,799
you're making your app more secure so

577
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,600
your api will be able to defend itself

578
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,200
because it has input validation

579
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,799
available to it now because you just

580
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,240
defined that

581
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,120
but without that that means someone like

582
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,720
me could go in

583
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,919
and say okay so um yeah i'm 4 000 years

584
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,320
old how's that for you okay cool and

585
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,760
that might break your application

586
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,080
eventually and so it is important to do

587
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,520
linting on your api definition files

588
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,440
okay so the other thing is you don't

589
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,039
have to put everything in the dash so

590
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,159
what you could do let's say you've

591
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,400
decided to record a horror file and

592
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,760
you're only going to do technology

593
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,360
specific tasks

594
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,720
and then you're going to do

595
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,640
other things so what are other ways that

596
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,600
you can use a das that's automated that

597
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,440
goes with ci cd

598
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,280
so we talked briefly about how you can

599
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,919
make a copy of the pipeline and not

600
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,520
release it anywhere

601
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,280
just put it somewhere that you can do

602
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,919
security testing you can even like

603
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,240
create a container load it up add your

604
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,720
app to it

605
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,480
do all your testing then release those

606
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,880
resources out back into the cloud

607
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,240
and finish and just have your test

608
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,200
results

609
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,120
so you can do that without blocking

610
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,039
releases but what other things we could

611
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,720
do so first of all you can have

612
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,080
scheduled automated regular scanning so

613
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,400
i like to do this at least once a month

614
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,000
for all my apps that are currently in

615
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,720
production and all the apis so have

616
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,120
scans like a scan runs every night of

617
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,240
the month

618
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,159
and that report comes in and someone

619
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,400
looks at it and decides if it thinks

620
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,320
those are real vulnerabilities or maybe

621
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,760
some of them are false positives

622
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,360
depending upon the type of tool you're

623
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,880
using

624
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,120
and then put those things in the backlog

625
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,679
and then go talk to teams about it so if

626
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,840
you have 30 apps you could run one every

627
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,799
night

628
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,799
and you just have to look at one report

629
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,159
per day except on mondays you have to

630
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,720
look at three reports but the point is

631
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,640
is that then you would be able to make

632
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,559
sure every app is having thorough

633
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,000
testing

634
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,520
and it's still automated it's happening

635
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,559
while you're not at work no one's

636
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,640
waiting for those resources so this is

637
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,400
the thing i see a lot at a lot of

638
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,679
companies

639
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,039
another thing you can do is want to

640
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,120
offer manual scans so

641
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,760
last year i helped some companies do m a

642
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,280
some mergers and acquisitions and

643
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,640
they're like we're gonna buy you know

644
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,559
these companies and so i went and i just

645
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,000
used the dash camera on all the

646
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,600
different apps and i was like

647
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,120
okay so this one's going to cost like

648
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,679
tons of money to fix i found like

649
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,760
100 vulnerabilities this one i only

650
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,600
found six i think we could fix this very

651
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,880
quickly i don't think it will cost that

652
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,360
much etc and so i used a whole bunch of

653
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,360
different types of scanning tools to do

654
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,120
an assessment for them of the state of

655
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,720
security at that company and then they

656
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,799
renegotiated the price

657
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,480
and whenever i get a tool the first

658
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,640
thing i do is play with it manually

659
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,480
because i want to know like how it works

660
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,080
and how i can make it go faster and how

661
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,919
i can make it find more things

662
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,159
and so usually whenever you get a tool

663
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,159
the first thing you do is manual testing

664
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,320
so there's still space for that in our

665
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,919
industry there is still people doing

666
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:53,360
that every day

667
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,200
another thing you can do so every

668
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,520
pentester ever basically

669
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,000
they use a das tool and they do manual

670
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,880
testing so they'll use a scanner that's

671
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,120
usually what we call it like oh yeah i'm

672
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,720
still doing quick scans to like check

673
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,320
and see if there's anything that i might

674
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,480
have missed with my eyes but sometimes a

675
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,000
dash scanner will find something that

676
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,919
manual testing doesn't and vice versa so

677
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,400
you get a much better more complete

678
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,360
result

679
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,440
when you have a person who's a security

680
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,400
expert doing manual testing as well

681
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,200
but it's expensive and it takes weeks

682
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,360
and so you have to choose where you do

683
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,039
that like most companies can't afford to

684
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,360
do a pen test everywhere so you use a

685
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,000
lot of dynamic scanning quite regularly

686
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,400
and then you do like spot pen tests or

687
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,760
just the ones that have to be pci

688
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,440
compliant or whatever the case is where

689
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,200
you were

690
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,640
i want to remind you that you still have

691
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,960
to do other types of testing we can't

692
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,480
only do

693
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,039
sa uh dynamic testing so there's static

694
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,720
testing where it just looks at the code

695
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,159
that your team wrote

696
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,559
which is called sas there's software

697
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,559
composition analysis where it just looks

698
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,480
at your dependencies your libraries your

699
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,880
frameworks any code you your team didn't

700
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,120
write but that is part of your app to

701
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,200
see if it's known to be vulnerable

702
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,520
there's is which is interactive

703
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,760
application security testing where

704
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,360
basically it's a binary and you put it

705
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,760
inside your app and it tests as you use

706
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,880
your app

707
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,279
there's oops wrong button there's secret

708
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,880
scanning where it just looks through

709
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,039
your entire code base and it tries to

710
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,440
find secrets so this could be an api key

711
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,440
an api secret a password a connection

712
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,080
string etc anything like that that

713
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,440
shouldn't be kept in your code it should

714
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,600
be in a secret management tool

715
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,400
and so

716
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,159
that is really cool

717
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,400
we want to do these tests as or some of

718
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,640
these tests as well

719
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,480
so these are places where you can do

720
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,080
dynamic scanning so you could do

721
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,080
security regression testing with unit

722
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,480
tests because the unit test

723
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,400
basically your ide creates a little baby

724
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,799
mini web server and you can do security

725
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,960
tests there for the first time then you

726
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,760
can do dynamic scanning against your dat

727
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,960
like your dev server or your local host

728
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,039
then in the testing phase you can do you

729
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,960
know full blast test

730
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,559
i didn't mean that for it to rhyme but

731
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,120
it just does um and you could also do a

732
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,080
manual penetration test in a pipeline so

733
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,600
release

734
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,880
the release

735
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,559
phase and maintenance phase is where you

736
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,159
use pipelines so that's where you want

737
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,240
to tune your das and just do certain

738
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,080
types of tests and then you could do

739
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,159
scheduled weekly tests

740
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,559
after it's released into production

741
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,080
um i was talking about like how the

742
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,960
first time i ran and asked how i felt so

743
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,640
i felt kind of like this

744
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,200
a little like that i really was like i

745
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,679
am a hacker now this is awesome

746
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:39,200
and so uh i feel like it's really fun

747
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,120
and i know that i'm silly and that is

748
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,480
okay

749
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,200
but

750
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,320
when i first ran one it was just so fun

751
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,240
and i felt so amazing that i found

752
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,400
security vulnerabilities that as a dev i

753
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,320
never found before and so

754
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,559
then as a dev i started doing scans and

755
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,159
i started teaching other devs to do

756
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:57,840
scanning and you could find a lot of

757
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,120
stuff

758
00:25:59,120 --> 00:25:59,919
so

759
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,520
with a quick conclusion because we only

760
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,120
have two minutes left

761
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,200
we need to do dynamic scanning because

762
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,720
any person on the internet can do a

763
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,720
dynamic scan of our app and we need to

764
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,640
keep ahead of those people

765
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,799
automation is our friend but if you are

766
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,880
at these sites you already know that

767
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,440
dynamics testing in a pipeline it has to

768
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,000
be fast and it has to be accurate or no

769
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,360
one's going to want to hang out with you

770
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,520
at lunch all the devops people are going

771
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,120
to be like no there's tanya she broke

772
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,200
our pipeline nope this seat's taken

773
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,880
missy

774
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,039
we can do dynamics testing outside of

775
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,960
the pipeline but still be devops

776
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,279
friendly that is okay we're not breaking

777
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,960
any rules

778
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,799
other types of testing are still needed

779
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,720
so we can find as many vulnerabilities

780
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,640
as possible and make our app as safe as

781
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,840
we can

782
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,799
and basically i'm pretty silly um that's

783
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,400
a thing you probably have picked up on

784
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,720
already anyway i have a couple free

785
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,720
resources i want to give you

786
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,400
uh some some are free the books are not

787
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,919
free but everything else is free so

788
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,200
first of all

789
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,120
i have a podcast that we had purple

790
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,320
podcast

791
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,480
where this season we're learning little

792
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,039
tiny security lessons so you could

793
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,039
subscribe on any platform or watch it on

794
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,000
youtube

795
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,720
um

796
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,720
these are all books about devops except

797
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,640
mine which is about security and i have

798
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,640
a chapter about devops

799
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,760
um i think we can't do it right i mean i

800
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,360
think we can't do security right unless

801
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,679
we're doing it right and i think devops

802
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,679
is the most efficient and effective and

803
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,360
quite frankly fun

804
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,440
way to make software

805
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,440
the we hack purple community is free

806
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,279
there's like no upsell or anything it is

807
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:34,000
just free we have little meetups on the

808
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,320
internet sometimes we meet up in person

809
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,960
we have articles we have blogs we have

810
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,559
lots of conversations and problem

811
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,000
solving and we have a ton of free

812
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,520
courses in there

813
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,919
and so everyone is invited to that

814
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:47,520
every monday this is what snea was

815
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,679
talking about on twitter is cyber

816
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,640
mentoring monday where basically we use

817
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,520
this hashtag and we respond to so i

818
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,520
always do a tweet to try to start off a

819
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,279
thread but basically people reach out

820
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,279
and say i need a professional mentor and

821
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,480
other people

822
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,240
from within the industry swoop in and

823
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,159
help them and sometimes they become

824
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:07,520
their mentors sometimes they become

825
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,039
their friend sometimes they have a

826
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,720
virtual coffee with them and suggest a

827
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,320
bunch of books that really change their

828
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,600
career and maybe it could help you

829
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,360
resource is bright so bright has a

830
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,360
highly technical blog with a lot of

831
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,960
information about like every type of

832
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,640
vulnerability and how to fix it so

833
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,559
that's pretty handy

834
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,240
and resource is me

835
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,320
i am she hacks purple basically on all

836
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,000
the platforms you can think of i have a

so much thank you to the entire b-sides

842
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,159
organizing crew because without them

843
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:43,760
this conference would not happen thank

844
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,919
you to all of you for attending

845
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,000
being in person is an important way to

846
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,760
do community building

847
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,600
and thank you to the entire

848
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,600
international b-sides community that

849
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,120
encourages different cities around the

850
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,480
world to do this

851
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,399
i'm tonya jenka and thank you so much

852

yes please

865
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,919
so uh thank you for the nice

866
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,799
presentation it was really enlightened i

867
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:45,840
would say

868
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,159
uh just one point when you mentioned

869
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,039
that uh someone needs to write the test

870
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,080
for the apis like i'd uh describe them

871
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,399
usually who is doing that i'm trying to

872
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,480
imagine it like uh

873
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,480
is a security person that's doing that

874
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,880
to some from the keyway team so who is

875
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,799
actually describing the api so that when

876
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,039
we run the dust we know that

877
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,279
it's complete

878
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,360
ideally the software developers would do

879
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,360
that part ideally

880
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,360
so every organization is different but

881
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,039
where i've worked

882
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,720
is generally the software developers

883
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,320
that are responsible for adding those

884
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,360
parts

885
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,279
but quite frankly usually it's the

886
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,880
security team that notices they're

887
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,440
missing because when i was at dev

888
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,080
or a software developer i say dev a lot

889
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,240
i like i didn't know to do that i was

890
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,320
like it works it does all the things my

891
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,720
client asked for it's perfect

892
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,399
and it wasn't until i became friends

893
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,080
with an ethical hacker and he's like

894
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,039
actually

895
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,720
it does do all the things you need it to

896
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,240
do but it does a lot of stuff it's not

897
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,960
supposed to do i'm like really

898
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,080
and so um usually it's the security team

899
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,159
that starts asking for linting it it

900
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:53,679
really depends because there's a lot of

901
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,120
software developers that are very

902
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,720
security obsessed

903
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,000
and so they might start doing it

904
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,080
themselves but if you want everyone in

905
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,640
your entire organization to be doing it

906
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,640
you usually have to provide a tool for

907
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,240
all the software developers give them a

908
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,640
lesson on what you expect from them

909
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,640
because otherwise what you receive will

910
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,640
be very different depending upon what

911
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,080
type of experience each step has

912
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,480
does that answer your question yes so

913
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,000
just to confirm do we understand it i

914
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,880
would need to enroll the developers or

915
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,799
to sell this idea to them say hey as

916
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,039
part of the development process we also

917
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:29,039
need to think about to writing tests

918
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,360
that the dust can use or tool

919
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,440
that would be it oh so they don't have

920
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,320
to write a test the das writes the test

921
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,960
what they need to do is lint their

922
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,679
definition file so you open it up in

923
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,080
something like 42 crunch or bright or

924
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,760
something else like that

925
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,240
and then it tells you this api

926
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,240
definition is incomplete

927
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,320
and it'll actually give you code you can

928
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,760
copy and paste

929
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,440
and it'll say stuff like okay so this is

930
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,600
a string cool what's the maximum length

931
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,440
of this string what's the minimum length

932
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,080
of this string are there any uh like

933
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,760
which character should be allowed in

934
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,919
this string and so you'll say let's say

935
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,320
like lowercase a through to z uppercase

936
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,320
a through to z and then zero through to

937
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,279
nine

938
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,600
then it won't let any other characters

939
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,760
in there does that make sense

940
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,159
okay now it's clear thank you

941
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:21,840
okay thank you that was a great question

942
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,960
hi tanya uh i love cats though thank you

943
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,679
a lot um

944
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,679
question about about trying to scale and

945
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:32,480
trying to roll out um

946
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,120
dynamic software testing is awesome and

947
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,919
i want to offer that to my dev teams so

948
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,320
i go to the people that prioritize stuff

949
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,480
like that into the backlog and then i

950
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,360
have

951
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,320
five pos sitting in front of me of which

952
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,480
i need one volunteer

953
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,320
and all of them think

954
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,519
if i go

955
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:54,159
and volunteer for this i can throw away

956
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,399
all my roadmap for my products and

957
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,320
features

958
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,200
how do i how do you get over that first

959
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,200
step of them being scared of you

960
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,799
um i so

961
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,279
when the first time i was on a security

962
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,960
team i had been on the software

963
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,519
development team at that same company so

964
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,760
they all already knew me by name like i

965
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,679
already would eat lunch with them or or

966
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:19,600
hang out with them so they all already

967
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,320
knew me so it wasn't as intimidating for

968
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,559
them but then when i went on to the next

969
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,080
company

970
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,559
none of the software developers knew me

971
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,399
and so what i did was is i started

972
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,320
giving little presentations about the

973
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,279
things i wanted and so the presentation

974
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,519
would always start with like this is a

975
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,519
big problem that i see and i wouldn't

976
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,679
say like at our company i'd be like on

977
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,440
the internet it'd be like there's you

978
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,360
know like injection vulnerabilities on

979
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,720
the internet this is how it works and

980
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,399
this is how scary it is and like let's

981
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:50,559
do one together and then i'd be like but

982
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,720
we could stop it from happening here and

983
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,640
then i'd show them what they could do to

984
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,640
help stop it like i can test for it and

985
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,159
find it you could prevent it in the

986
00:33:58,159 --> 00:33:59,600
first place

987
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,679
and i would kind of just try to show it

988
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:03,919
to them and make them as excited as i

989
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:06,159
was if that makes sense and like show

990
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:09,520
them my passion about it and right now

991
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,960
you're like oh she seems like a really

992
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,520
good presenter yeah i sucked i was

993
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,199
really not good when i started i've been

994
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,879
doing this for like eight or nine years

995
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:18,879
now and so when i present i'm really

996
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:20,719
comfortable and i'm not like super

997
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,000
nervous where i feel like i can't

998
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,440
breathe and my heart's beating super

999
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,918
fast but even when i was like not very

1000
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:28,159
good at presenting they could tell i

1001
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,159
really really cared about it and that's

1002
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,879
why i was showing them and so the first

1003
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,800
couple times i presented

1004
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,040
i really thought i was gonna die but i

1005
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,440
didn't clearly because i'm still alive

1006
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,239
um and and it turned out like they

1007
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,320
wanted to know if that makes sense and

1008
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,480
they're like yeah you seem really like

1009
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,199
worried about this i am and so that's

1010
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,760
what's worked for me is just showing

1011
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,359
them the thing

1012
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:54,800
sometimes people

1013
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,159
like i've worked at places where the

1014
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,920
security team says we do this now and

1015
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,440
you have to do that and they don't

1016
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,119
explain it and i find it doesn't go very

1017
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:02,960
well so i always try to explain

1018
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,160
why

1019
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,599
we want to do it

1020
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:06,960
how to do it

1021
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,280
and i will help you and then if someone

1022
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,960
gets stuck i just like run over to their

1023
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,359
desk and help them and i keep doing that

1024
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:14,560
until they're like i don't need you

1025
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,800
tanya go away stop being like hovering

1026
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,480
over me i got this

1027
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,760
and then eventually

1028
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,440
the software developers are better at it

1029
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,280
than i am

1030
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,119
and they don't need me anymore for that

1031
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:25,920
thing

1032
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,560
but for me i've had a lot of luck with

1033
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,640
presenting the problem and like this is

1034
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,040
what i think can help and i need all of

1035
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,599
your help to get this done

1036
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:38,000
does that help you

1037
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,599
hopefully yeah we'll see

1038
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:40,960
but thank you okay

1039
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,640
good luck

1040
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,040
i actually have two presentations that i

1041
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,760
open sourced in my github so if you go

1042
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,960
to github.com then she hacks purple

1043
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,079
i have a

1044
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,640
a project there of presentations where i

1045
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,839
teach you

1046
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:57,680
how to give my presentation to your

1047
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,800
depths

1048
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,760
and so i have two so far there and a lot

1049
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,960
of people have told me like yeah i

1050
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,560
wanted to get the devs interested and so

1051
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,640
it's like my slides it's a video of me

1052
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,240
doing it then it's a video of me saying

1053
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,920
what to say for each slide and what

1054
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,760
you're trying to accomplish and then i

1055
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,760
have a description of the whole thing

1056
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,079
and so you could try one of those if you

1057
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,599
don't know what to present because i

1058
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,040
didn't know what to present when i

1059
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,440
started

1060
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,160
yeah

1061
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,560
are there any any other questions

1062
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,640
if there are no further questions or

1063
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,560
pane is still here does anybody have any

1064
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,119
other question

1065
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,839
all right great tanya thank you so much

1066
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:42,000
for explaining us because when it comes

1067
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,640
to product security dust scanning the

1068
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,359
entire ci cd pipeline is super critical

1069
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:49,520
for everyone not just the engineers or

1070
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,839
the developers but even for the security

1071
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:54,880
professionals or the security engineers

1072
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,640
call call it like that

1073
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,520
sometimes um there's one quick question

1074
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,640
for you

1075
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,720
with the dust scanning involving in the

1076
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,480
entire pipeline

1077
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,839
how do we basically handle these

1078
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:09,119
vulnerabilities in a way that we are

1079
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,200
still friends with the developers and

1080
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,040
not just bombard them

1081
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,960
because sometimes it might happen that

1082
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,800
we say oh that vulnerability is super

1083
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,119
critical it's it's got like the cbs

1084
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:22,400
score the ni like say for example 9.6

1085
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,800
you need to fix it in two days or one

1086
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,599
day

1087
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:28,720
so how do we still try to deliver this

1088
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,560
how do we rely exactly on dust scan

1089
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,599
whereas

1090
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,599
and how do we convince our developers

1091
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:37,280
that you know

1092
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,680
even though it's a high vulnerability

1093
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,320
the tool says it's super critical

1094
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,240
but based on this

1095
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,480
can you explain how do we maintain the

1096
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,480
relationship still happy and nice

1097
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,640
so i usually try to give

1098
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,280
the developers a license for the tool

1099
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,280
i'm using so that if they want to they

1100
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,960
can test it earlier

1101
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,720
so if they want to when they put it on

1102
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,480
their dev server or their local host

1103
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,480
they can run the test themselves

1104
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,480
so when they get to the ci cd pipeline

1105
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,240
it's like a double check if that makes

1106
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,119
sense

1107
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,880
um i've had a lot of developers say they

1108
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,800
feel it's embarrassing if they break the

1109
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,680
build

1110
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,079
and so they would rather have access to

1111
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:19,119
look at it themselves first so if i can

1112
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:21,760
afford it i get them all tools or

1113
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,119
licenses

1114
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:25,200
and then another thing is is i usually

1115
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,400
start

1116
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,280
with not breaking the build i work up to

1117
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,599
it so first we're just running scans

1118
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:33,359
manually and i'm showing them results

1119
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:35,680
and asking them to fix things then i

1120
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,520
start testing a little bit just like a

1121
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,079
couple of things in the pipeline and

1122
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,960
then when they and i just alert i'm like

1123
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,480
alert this is a hi alert this is this

1124
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,079
and i try to have

1125
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,560
um sort of two different service level

1126
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,720
agreements once we start having one so

1127
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,640
at first it's like anything that was

1128
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,920
already there

1129
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,400
you know you have months to fix

1130
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,320
but any new vulnerabilities that are

1131
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,720
higher critical you're not allowed those

1132
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,480
so i will break the build if a new

1133
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,800
critical vulnerability comes into it so

1134
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,040
at first no breaking and then at first

1135
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,280
i'm only breaking on new things that are

1136
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,760
very high then new things that are just

1137
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,640
high

1138
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,079
and then new things maybe that are

1139
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,079
medium depending upon what level that

1140
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:19,200
you need

1141
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,880
and then the stuff that's in the backlog

1142
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,640
the stuff that was there before we had a

1143
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,760
scanner

1144
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,920
i give them more time and we talk about

1145
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,880
those

1146
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,400
over time because they're already out

1147
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,800
there and prod and us not letting them

1148
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,560
go to prod with those old

1149
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,160
vulnerabilities they're already out

1150
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,240
there doesn't really make a lot of sense

1151
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,160
like i want them to fix all of it now

1152
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,480
but i know that they can't especially

1153
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,960
if they're currently doing a project

1154
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,200
and no project time has been allocated

1155
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,760
to do security bug fixing another thing

1156
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,280
i do is i go talk to all the project

1157
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,599
managers and i tell them

1158
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,440
i want to be at all your project kickoff

1159
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,440
meetings and i want to have a two-week

1160
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,480
sprint

1161
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,280
at least one that is just to fix bugs

1162
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,119
and so maybe like four months in or

1163
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,720
something we have a sprint where for two

1164
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,319
straight weeks or three weeks however

1165
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,400
long your sprints are all you do is fix

1166
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,640
bugs that i found and so i get ready in

1167
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,400
advance so they have lots of work to do

1168
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,640
during that time and then they just fix

1169
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,960
lots of bugs so by the time they go out

1170
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,040
to production with everything

1171
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,960
it's like pretty good do you know what i

1172
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,000
mean and so i try to get there earlier

1173
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
and be there and talk to them the whole

1174
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,760
way through the project and i don't mean

1175
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,680
every single day but like check-ins

1176
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,440
quite regularly

1177
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,280
and then by the time they get to the end

1178
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,359
it's usually really good

1179
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,119
with legacy software it's different so

1180
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:36,880
software that's already existed i try to

1181
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,280
be a lot more patient because usually

1182
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,280
fixing like a dependency

1183
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,200
it could mean you know if the dependency

1184
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,520
is really old like we saw during log4j

1185
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,760
in december

1186
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,200
it could be a really like it could be

1187
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,800
like a complete re-architecting of the

1188
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,280
whole app to update that and so

1189
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,599
sometimes i negotiate if it's really

1190
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,680
really really bad i'll say okay well i

1191
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,680
need five thousand dollars from your

1192
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,319
project team so that i can put a like a

1193
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,480
web app firewall or a rasp or something

1194
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,160
in front of your app because it's so

1195
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,560
dangerous having it on the internet

1196
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,240
and then you have you know this long to

1197
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,880
fix things but if you won't let me put a

1198
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,319
waft in front of it then you only have

1199
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:16,000
this long to fix things and then they're

1200
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,760
usually like we found five thousand

1201
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,440
dollars tanya

1202
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,400
um so i try to like negotiate with them

1203
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,680
and realize that they have other

1204
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,440
priorities and i'm just one of those

1205
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,640
priorities

1206
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,000
and then things usually go better and

1207
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,200
there's some teams where they're just

1208
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,319
like no go away you're wasting my time i

1209
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:34,000
want to talk to you and those are the

1210
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,520
most difficult ones and that's where i

1211
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,599
have to be like mean tanya

1212
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,359
and i like first start off really nice

1213
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,200
but then eventually i'm like i'm here to

1214
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,720
bother you because you still haven't

1215
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,000
fixed those things and like five

1216
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,920
separate times i've visited you and

1217
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,680
eventually i'm gonna visit your boss

1218
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,520
right like

1219
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,800
like you're forcing me to do this

1220
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,160
because you're not holding up your end

1221
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,520
of the bargain like is that what you

1222
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,280
want because that's not what i want that

1223
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,599
sucks we'll never be friends if i just

1224
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,359
talk to your boss every time

1225
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:00,800
and sometimes they'll give in and then

1226
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,440
sometimes i have to talk to their boss

1227
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,920
and if their boss says like well i'm

1228
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,520
fine with it i'll talk to the bigger

1229
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,000
boss and eventually i'll try to get them

1230
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,400
to sign off on that risk so i'll say you

1231
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,160
don't want to fix these things you know

1232
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,000
you feel times more important than that

1233
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,160
cool but you need to sign off that you

1234
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,839
are accepting the risk on behalf of the

1235
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:21,280
organization because for me this is

1236
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,040
completely unacceptable and i do not

1237
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,200
accept this risk and when we're in the

1238
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,119
newspaper someday with a giant breach

1239
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:29,359
it's cool your name's gonna be in there

1240
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:31,359
it's cool

1241
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:34,079
and then usually someone gives in

1242
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,119
and

1243
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:36,800
i work places where they don't and

1244
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,400
there's one place where i resigned in

1245
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,760
protest because i just wouldn't fix

1246
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,599
anything ever and i just didn't want to

1247
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:42,800
change and i didn't want to do any

1248
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,160
security and i was like i won't work

1249
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,040
here

1250
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,040
and that's it

1251
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,960
so that's the grateful lesson that we

1252
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,359
still are learning and i guess we are

1253
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:53,359
still going to learn the same lesson for

1254
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:55,920
next couple of years till the time each

1255
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,720
and every company decides to shift left

1256
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,280
and consider security as an integral

1257
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,440
part and not an external part of the

1258
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,480
entire ssdlc process itself

1259
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,200
but

1260
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,560
that said um thank you so much tanya for

1261
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,280
sharing your insights and such amazing

1262
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,280
guidance and advice

1263
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,839
and we are so happy and honored to have

1264
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:20,480
you here and we wish that next year

1265
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,560
maybe we can have you physically present

1266
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,319
at the event

1267
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:27,839
we wish you all the good luck

1268
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,710
thank you thank you

1269
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:33,889
[Applause]
